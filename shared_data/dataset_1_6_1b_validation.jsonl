These are all things that you the people of this valley can do with the right kind of cooperation from your towns and cities, and your States and the Federal Government. Now the Democratic Party has always believed that the Government exists to help the people do the things they cannot get done by themselves. We want to give the people of this valley and all New England whatever help you yourselves desire in building up the resources of this great countryside. That is what we have done in other river basins, helping people make the most of their fine rivers. The Republican Party has exactly the opposite philosophy. They believe it is the purpose of Government to help special private interests exploit our national resources for their own private profit. If the Republicans take control in Washington, they will not help you with your navigation problems, or stream pollution, or power-for that might interfere with the enrichment of the manufacturers and the utilities who like things to stay as they are. Do not be fooled by scare stories that somebody in Washington wants to come up here and take this river away from you, or take control of it. They are just afraid you might stand up someday and take control of your resources yourselves. The truth is you can develop and control this river yourselves, and a Democratic government will cooperate with your local and State authorities to help you do it. Then you will really own the river, and be able to enjoy it the way you should, and make it work for you, in your interest, and not in the interests of private power. Now election day comes in November, as you know, on the 4th, and election day is the time when the people of the United States exercise the control of their Government. If you do not take an interest, if you do not get yourselves registered, if you do not go to the polls on the 4th of November, and you have bad government, you have nobody in the world to blame but yourselves. So, if you are going to do right by yourselves, if you are going to do right by your country, if you are going to help the world situation to come out without a third world war, you will go to the polls on November the 4th and you will vote for Stevenson and Sparkman, and we will have 4 more years of good government.

He did a fine job in Nuremberg, prosecuting the Nazi war criminals, and a very good job back home in the Justice Department. I know he will be a good prosecutor for your interests if you send him to Washington. You have a very, very fine gentleman running for Congressman at Large in Stanley Pribyson. Now, on our national ticket, Adlai Stevenson and John Sparkman are very fine men, with great progressive records of public service. They both have shown that they care about the problems of the plain everyday people of this country. I hope you have been listening to Governor Stevenson's speeches. I hope you will go and hear him speak when he comes back to New England. He is talking sense to the American people, telling everybody where he stands on all the issues. Now there is a little thing I want to mention to you just quietly and under the cover I hope the Enfield Society for the Detection of Horse Thieves and Robbers is still in operation. I know the Society was keeping up its headquarters in Enfield a few years ago. And I hope the Society is all set for some emergencies just in case something happens next November that we do not expect. Because now I am going to give you some quotations now these are not my remarks at all, these are quotes because if the Republicans should win this election, the Society is going to have lots of business after November the 4th. And this is what they said themselves. At least that is what they say about each other, in Chicago, and you would not find me to be one that would deny it. At the Republican Convention last July, there were two groups that had a whale of a fight with one another. One side was the so-called liberal wing of the party, with a lot of New Englanders in it. Now you may remember the so-called liberals spent their time calling the Taft men a bunch of rustlers. And the Taft men returned the compliment with interest, I will say. The so-called liberals were successful so Taft said in stealing the big prize at Chicago.

A vote for the Republicans this year is a vote for Taft, for Taft's foreign policy, for Taft's labor policy, for Taft's domestic policies in general. He has said so, and the General has backed him up. Now that would be a terrible thing for this country, just as those liberal New England Republicans agreed that it would when they fought Taft at Chicago. It would be bad for the country and the peace of the world, and it would be very bad for you.

He is one of the outstanding men in public service in our generation. When he speaks to the people, he gives them the straight story. Stevenson is a man of great integrity and real feeling for the everyday people of this country. He is a man you can trust in the Office of the President. That is also true of John Sparkman. He is one of our most progressive leaders in the Congress. He has proved by his record of 15 years in the House and Senate that he can be trusted to work for all the people. While I am here this happens to be Roger Putnam's hometown, and while I am talking about men who have given great service to the American people, I want to pay tribute to this hometown's man of yours the former mayor of Springfield, Roger Putnam. Roger Putnam has been down in Washington for over a year now, handling the tough job of Economic Stabilizer. He took over that assignment just after the Republicans had finished their first hatchet job on our price and wage controls. He has since lived through another attempted slaughter by the Republicans, and he has done a grand job in helping to stabilize our economy in spite of all the Republican obstruction. I suppose you know that the Republican candidate for President has been going around the country moaning about the high prices we are paying today, and blaming it all on the Democratic administration.

{"id": 5782, "text": "Maybe nobody's told him that his party in Congress has a long, unbroken record of trying to kill or cripple price and wage and rent controls at every chance they have. Back in 1946 when we needed controls, until our civilian production got back to normal, the Republicans voted almost to a man to kill controls. They finally succeeded, and the cost of living went up 15 percent in 6 months, just as I predicted it would. I am sure you all remember that period, the worst inflationary rise in the history of the country. In 1947 and 1948 I tried to get price control authority back on the statute books, but the Republican good-for-nothing 80th Congress just laughed at my efforts. Then the Korean emergency came along, and by the time we got a controls bill passed and the stabilization agencies established, the cost of living had gone up almost 8 percent in 6 months. Then in early November 1951, we got a general price freeze put on. And what did the Republicans do, once we put a lid on prices? They began a vicious attack on the basic price control legislation. In 1951 they put across the Capehart amendment which by now has added a billion dollars in higher prices to the American people. Last year the Republican Senators voted 7 to 1 to curtail price rollbacks, and 12 to 1 to prevent effective control of black marketing in meat. This year the Republican Congressmen voted 4 to 1 to scuttle all price controls, and 6 to 1 to end all rent controls. And then to top it all off, in 1951, and again this year, the Republicans ganged up with a few Democrats to slash appropriations so that the remaining control authority could not be properly enforced against the chiselers and the profiteers. Despite these Republican attempts to wreck controls, we have been doing a pretty good job to keep inflation down. In the past 20 months, the cost of living has risen less than 4 percent. Prices are higher than they ought to be, and I told you why. But in spite of high prices, most people are better off than they ever were before. The dollar does not buy as much as it once did, but people have a lot more dollars to buy with. The income has gone up a lot faster than prices in these last 20 years twice as fast, in fact. The Hoover dollars were worth a lot, all right, but it took many people an entire day's labor to earn one of them.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsrearplatformandotherinformalremarksconnecticutmassachusettsandnewhampshire", "title": "Rear Platform and Other Informal Remarks in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/rear-platform-and-other-informal-remarks-connecticut-massachusetts-and-new-hampshire", "publication_date": "16-10-1952", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S Truman"], "gender": ["M"]}}

The Republicans have given this country two terrible demonstrations of how they can drive prices down. In 1921 they got prices down 20 percent in a big hurry and there were 7 million people out of work. In 1931 they got prices down 25 percent in 2 years-and it took 14 million unemployed to do that. Any time you hear their candidate talk about cutting prices, and bringing back that Hoover dollar, you had better stop and think how the Republicans go about those things. In the first effort they made 7 million unemployed. In the next effort they made 14 million unemployed, and if you give them another chance, you will probably have 18 million. You will not get steady prices from an outfit like that boom and bust is their stock in trade. Their record speaks for itself. They will not look out for your jobs, your income, or the prices you have to pay. The Constitution provides that the power of government rests in the people, and when the people exercise their right to vote, they exercise the power that controls the Government. Now I am going around the country trying to get the people to think, trying to get people to read the record. I am trying to get them to remember that the record made in the Congress by the Republicans in Congress is the record on which they have to run. They do not want to run on that record. I want you also to study the record of the Democrats in Congress. The majority of the Democrats in Congress have always been for the people, and they always will be for the people. Now, if you want to look out for your own interests, if you want to look out for the welfare of this great Nation of ours, if you want to look out for the welfare of the free nations of the world, and to keep the world free, and to keep communism from this country, the way to do that is to vote for the party that has always been against communism, that has always fought them and convicted them.

Right now we have a total national production of about $340 billion. Defense accounts for less than one-sixth of that output. Now in 1945, after the Japanese folded up, I organized a commission to look into the return to civil affairs after World War II; and I sent that committee-two of them, one of them was Senator Benton of Connecticut to see Senator Taft, who was then the Republican leader in the Senate. I had them ask him what his remedy was we had decided that we needed a $140 billion income if we were going to keep people at work. Taft said that was impossible, we would never reach $100 billion income, and the best thing to do was to take all the women out of work and let the men do the work, and then this country could go along and everybody would have jobs. Now, if that is not one for the book, I do not know what is. And he is running their present nominee for President. Now, defense accounts for less than one sixth of that $340 billion output. If it were not for the defense effort, we would be even more prosperous than we are now. The defense effort is making us postpone and put off a lot of things we need, things that will make our country greater and stronger. Our population is growing fast, our cities are growing that means lots of things to do. We need a lot of redevelopment in our cities. We need more houses, better and cheaper houses, more roads, more schools, more hospitals. Out West where I have been, we need a lot more dams and irrigation works, and all those things. We need more food, and more consumers goods of every kind. Thousands of businessmen are ready now to expand their plants or build new ones. They see bigger markets ahead. In the city of Worcester, where you make all kinds of things, and know how to adapt your production fast, there will surely be a lot of good work for you, when defense tapers off.

They do not seem to have any notion of how to get prosperity and growth. For 20 years the Republicans have been voting against almost everything the Democrats have done to help build this country up.

Now, my friends, the reason I am rehashing this for you is because there never has been an organization about which so much misrepresentation and so many lies have been told as have been told about my Presidential family that runs the Government of the United States. Now I have three Secretaries. I have a number of Executive assistants and every one of whom is as efficient and able as any group of men that could be gotten together. Dean Acheson was the Deputy Chairman of the organization known as the Hoover Commission, which wrote and recommended the plans for the efficient reorganization of the Government. I have set the administrative end of our Government on a more efficient basis than it has been since the Government was launched. I am not bragging, I am merely telling you facts. And I have sent more reorganization plans to the Congress of the United States than all the other Presidents put together; and I have had more of them turned down by the Republicans and a coalition of Democrats who did not believe in the things that I want to do, than any other President has done. I am telling you all this so you will know the facts, and I am out here now for a specific purpose. I did not have to come out here and work for the election of a candidate for President. But with all the effort that has been put forth in the last 20 years to give you a government of the people, and by the people, and for the people, I felt that it was my duty to come out here and put the issues in this campaign before you, the people. The Republicans cannot discuss the issues because they do not dare. They have been wrong on every program that has come before the Congress of the United States where the interests of all the people are at stake. They will not talk about it. They want to go off on some side issue. The Republican candidate said he was going out on a crusade. He said that at Chicago. But he did not know what the crusade was about until Senator Taft told him. I feel terribly bad about having to say these things, because I was very fond of Eisenhower. I made him Chief of Staff of the United States ENTITY. I sent him to Europe in command of the greatest organization that we are now making to keep the Communists from taking the world.

And when you hear him, you will know as I do that he is a man you can trust. I want to tell you some things you ought to know about Adlai Stevenson's fine record as Governor of Illinois, but before I do that, I would like to read you an article someone sent me the other day from your local paper, the Sunday Sun for October 5th. I see you have the same opinion of the Sunday Sun that I have of the Kansas City Star. But sometimes, my friends, sometimes these awful newspapers have to print the truth, and this is one time it did. 307 thousand in social security checks were mailed to Lowell last week. Then the article goes on to say, This week will bring increased social security checks to about 800,000 people in greater Lowell. About 8,000, not 800,000 monthly benefit checks mailed during the first week of October will amount to about $307,000. Increases of from $5 to $8.60 each month will go to most retired workers who receive old-age insurance payments. Now I am glad these insurance benefits are being paid, but there is a story behind them I think you ought to know. For it is a good example of exactly what this election is all about. All the people who are getting these benefits have of course been paying premiums into the Treasury for years. And the amounts they and their employers paid in, turned out to be larger than were needed to finance the benefits paid out at the old rate. So extra money was piling up in the Treasury's insurance account. And last spring, I asked the Congress to raise the benefit rates and give this money back to the people who were receiving insurance benefits. It seemed to me that this was only fair-and a good way to help compensate for increases in the cost of living. The Democrats in Congress thought so, too. Our great Majority Leader, John W. McCormack, was one of those who helped to get action. And in May a social security bill, including this change and some other improvements, came up for a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives. The great majority of Democrats voted for it, of course, but twothirds of the Republicans voted against it, and the bill failed to pass. Well, John McCormack and some others, would not take No for an answer.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsrearplatformandotherinformalremarksconnecticutmassachusettsandnewhampshire", "title": "Rear Platform and Other Informal Remarks in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/rear-platform-and-other-informal-remarks-connecticut-massachusetts-and-new-hampshire", "publication_date": "16-10-1952", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S Truman"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 5793, "text": "They brought the bill up again a month later. And they turned the spotlight on the Republicans, who got a lot of heat, I am glad to say. Some of those Republicans got scared and enough of them changed their votes to let the bill go through this second time. The Senate passed it, too. I signed it with great pleasure. And 8,000 people here in Lowell are now getting the benefit. But they would never have gotten a thing if the Republicans had had their way and do not you forget it. Now I tell you the story because the Republican candidate for President spoke in Los Angeles a few days ago and claimed that his party was in favor of improving and extending social security. He asserted, and I quote him directly, The social security law was a bipartisan law to meet a need which had become urgent in the depression. You see, he is starting to say me too it is pretty late in this campaign, though, to start that, and I do not want you to believe it. In the first place, the social security law was not a bipartisan law. The Republicans fought tooth and toenail against the original social security law in 1935, and I was in the Senate and I know what I am talking about. They voted 95 to 1 to recommit the bill in the House of Representatives. That was the real test in the House. Of course, when we licked them on that, they strung along and voted to pass the bill. So now they claim they helped to start social security. They did not do anything of the kind. In 1936 the Republican candidate for President you remember him, All Landon campaigned against social security. He called it a cruel hoax. In the 80th, good-for-nothing Congress, the Republicans took social security protection away from nearly a million people. And in 1949 when the Democrats put through a great expansion of the social security program, most of the Republicans hampered and obstructed and fought against the very improvements their candidate now hints he might be for. You cannot afford to be fooled by this me too line. The Republican Party in Congress has a solid record of opposition to social security. Not so long ago, their candidate did not have much use for it, either. About 3 or 4 years ago, before he became a Republican politician, he was going around the country saying, If all that Americans want is security, they can go to prison.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsrearplatformandotherinformalremarksconnecticutmassachusettsandnewhampshire", "title": "Rear Platform and Other Informal Remarks in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/rear-platform-and-other-informal-remarks-connecticut-massachusetts-and-new-hampshire", "publication_date": "16-10-1952", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S Truman"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I have enjoyed meeting your candidates here in New Hampshire. I am glad you have a good Democrat running for Governor this year, because I expect poor Sherman Adams will be a nervous wreck after he gets off that campaign train he is on now. This year the Democratic Party has a candidate for President, one of the finest men to serve in public life in this generation-Adlai Stevenson. He is a man of integrity and conviction, and as Governor of Illinois he has proved his abilities as a civilian administrator, and he will make a great President. I have been traveling all across this country and back, from coast to coast, explaining to the people the main issues in this campaign. When you come right down to it, the big issue shows up in the basic differences between our two parties. The Democratic Party has always been the party with a heart for the people. With us the people come first. With the Republican Party, property and profits come first, and come ahead of the people. You people in this city have had firsthand experience with the way this Republican approach works against the people. You have been losing some of your textile mills, and one of the reasons is the Taft-Hartley law passed by the Republican 80th Congress. That act has almost stopped the growth of unions. It has made it easy for employers in non-unionized parts of the country to use every trick in the book to keep workers from organizing and obtaining better wages. That way, wages in other places have been kept down below what you have had to pay here, and this has made is very attractive for the textile companies to move out of New England. Now you might as well make up your minds that the Taft-Hartley Act and all the trouble it has caused is just small change alongside of the damage the Republicans would bring about if they got control of both the White House and the Congress.

That is what the Republicans did in the Both Congress when they had control. In the last 4 years, they have not reformed. In fact, in their platform this year in their platform they endorsed that good-for-nothing, do-nothing 80th Congress that I talked so much about in 1948. They endorsed all it did. For over 20 years now they have been fighting these forward-looking programs that the Democrats stand for, and they want to put the Democrats out of the White House so they can undo most of what the New Deal and fair Deal has done for the people. This year they thought they had their chance by putting up as their candidate for President a great military hero. They figured his popularity would cover up the black record of the Old Guard Republicans. But the General has made it clear that he is taking orders from the same old bunch of Old Guard Republicans.

Oh, they had a platform that was intended to appeal to everybody in the country, so I called them together and they met for about 3 or 4 weeks and did not do a thing.

I appreciate it very much--very much indeed this introduction, and I am particularly happy over that synthetic truth brigade that is supposed to be following me. You know, I was shadowed in 1948 by somebody, and now I am being shadowed again. We are telling the truth on them, and that really hurts. I am here in one of my many jobs--campaigning as a leader of the Democratic Party. It is good to come to a Democratic place like this. You gave me a good big majority in 1948. You have been Democratic since 1932. You have a good Democrat representing you in Congress--Wayne Aspinall. Awhile ago when I heard your national committeeman introduce John Metzger, I did not know who he was talking about. I know him as Bill, and I think he is all right, and he will make you a good Governor. I have known him a long, long time. Bill is a go-getter, and he will be an asset to Colorado and to you.

I have been in politics for 30 years, and in elective public office for 30 years, and down in Missouri there are 7 metropolitan papers, and I never had one for me in my whole life. If they did get for me, I would know I was wrong. I wish we had newspapers like that in Missouri. We need them. In most places I visit, the newspapers are against the Democrats. But your paper is a good one, and I am happy to say that about your newspaper. Your paper told of the progress you are making--when most papers keep telling the people how bad things are. If you listen to most of them, you would think the country is just on the verge of ruin. There are more animals in the county this year, as compared with last; there are more acres of bearing orchard and more acres of meadow hay; people own more household furniture; stocks of merchandise are greater; there is more farm equipment, except combines; there has been a great deal of building and improvements; and mining is on the increase. Well now, that is an awful situation for the Republicans to have to swallow in a campaign year. In addition to this, I understand you have a fine new veterans hospital here that will be of great value to this whole area. I congratulate you on that record. You are especially fortunate here, but we are having the same sort of situation all over the United States. This prosperity of ours is driving the Republican politicians almost crazy. That is the reason for those four little men following me. They cannot stand to see the country so well off under a Democratic administration.

Do you want to march off under the orders of the Republican general, down that shining corridor --whatever that is--or would you just as soon stay behind, stuck in the mud of this terrible New Deal prosperity ? The last time the Republicans marched off with us we were a long time getting back where we belonged. Today is the first day of your community chest drive, and I hope you will take a little of that prosperity and give it to help others who need it. One of the things that the Republicans are saying is that this prosperity is due to the defense program, and to the fighting in Korea. Do not you believe it. If we did not have the defense program, we would be even more prosperous. We would have a lot of things that we are holding back on now, because of defense. That is true of the atomic energy programs, too. We are developing peaceful uses for the atom--like the submarine I started last summer in Connecticut, that has an atomic engine in it. If it were not for defense, we could go ahead much faster with the peaceful uses of the atom, and of the uranium that you are mining around here in this State. They tell me that the independent uranium producers who are doing so much to get this ore out, are running into difficulties with existing Government procedures. I am going to look into that matter when I get back to Washington and see if it cannot be straightened out, and in a way that will give the little fellow a square break. I am always for the little man. If you look over the Republican policy, you will find that they are for property. The Democratic policy is for people. I think the people come first, then the property will take care of itself. We are working for peace. That is what our defense program is for. And with God's help we will get it.

Stevenson and Sparkman understand the problems of the little fellow, and they understand the problems of the West. They know that locked in the hills of western Colorado you have some of the most valuable natural resources to be found any place in the Nation. They know that these resources must be developed for all the people, and not just for the special interests. An example of the way to do this is the Bureau of Mines project for developing gasoline and oil products from coal and oil shale. There are about a thousand square miles in this area north and west of Rifle where beds of oil shale, hundreds of feet thick, will yield an average of 15 gallons or more of oil per ton of shale. This project promises to open up a vast new era of industrial expansion.

You will make no mistake voting for them. I am not running for office this time--I did not know whether you knew that or not-but I am going to leave the Government of the United States in good hands.

John Sparkman is one of the best men that the Senate has ever had there--and I spent 10 years in the Senate myself, so you know I am paying him a high compliment. One of the things that is most important to your progress and prosperity out here is the Federal program of reclamation and power projects. I have been telling the people in the West that the Republican Party is against these projects, and I have been exposing the record, showing how the Republicans in Congress have voted to hinder and obstruct and slash appropriations for these great dams and irrigation systems and powerlines. A Republican spokesman piped up the other day, and said this was unfair--that a Republican started the reclamation program. That is right, it was a Republican-Theodore Roosevelt, back in 1902, who started it. He was a Republican who had a great sympathy for the West. And you know what happened to him? He was thrown out of the Republican Party by the Wall Street bankers. He had to go out and set up a party of his own--the Bull Moose party. And the special interest groups have run the Republican Party ever since. The Republican Party always kicks out its liberals, or whips them into line. I could tell you a lot about this, and I will before this campaign is over. The reason the Republican Party cannot really be in favor of reclamation and public power, is that they let the private power lobby write their policies for them.

And he gave me a letter he prepared about obstacles for handicapped children and what his life was going to be like. And he said, You know, this wheelchair of mine cost, I think he said, $15,000.

And he said, Because my mother works for the city of New York, our family has been able to maintain a middle class lifestyle because our health policy pays for 80 percent of my bills. But it is been hard even for us. I had expensive surgery. I have this expensive wheelchair; I will have to replace it soon. But he said, So many of my young friends are almost destitute who are physically handicapped because of the conditions that exist. And if we were getting a good deal, the rest of us, that would be fine, but your country's spending 40 percent more on health care than any other country in the world. And it is only because we have refused to discipline ourselves to provide health care to everybody, like all our competitors do, that these stories are out there. We have to fight those who say we cannot do it. We can turn this economy around. If we can bring this deficit down, when nobody thought we could do it, if we can break gridlock, we can do this too. I ran for this job because I wanted to do what I could with the power vested by the framers of our Constitution in the Presidency to change the lives of ordinary Americans for the better. And anything, anything that diverts, divides, distracts, or destroys the spirit and the purpose of the American people, when we have so much on our plate here at home and around the world, is not good.

The Show Me State my attitude is, show me a good Senator, and I am going to back him. And we have got a great Senator in Jim Talent. I appreciate his spirit. I appreciate his working with the White House. He is an independent enough guy to tell us if we are not doing right. Tough, principled, unwilling to yield when he stands for when he believes he is correct. Every time I am with him, he is always talking about the citizens of Missouri. I say, What about Texas? So I am proud to stand here with him. And I think the people of Missouri will be wise to send this good man back to the United States Senate. It is good to meet your mother-in-law. It is a smart thing to bring the mother-in-law through the photo op line. I was also thrilled to meet Michael and Kate and Chrissy, Jim and Brenda's children.

She is sending a strong message as part of the freedom movement, and that is, you cannot be free unless women have a free role in society. But more importantly, she is a wonderful mother, wonderful wife, and a great First Lady for the United States. And I want to thank the senior Senator. That is appropriate to call you senior, but you are a little older than Talent, at least. Kit Bond has served this State with great distinction for a long time. And I am proud of your Governor.

It is an incredibly successful evening and which speaks not only to your hard work but also to the admiration that your Senator has earned by the people of Missouri. We have got a lot to do in Washington. One of the things I like about Talent is he understands that our job in Washington is to confront problems, not pass them on to future Congresses. That is what the American people expect from those of us who have been elected. And we have got some problems we got to solve. Now, we dealt with one of our problems, and that is our economy. We had some tough times for a while because of the enemy attack and the down cycle of our economy. I do not know if you know this or not, but in the last 2 years, we have added over 3.5 million new jobs. More Americans are working today in our country than in the Nation's history. And I appreciate the fact that Jim understands we cannot rest, that the job of Government is not to create the wealth but an environment in which people are willing to risk capital, an environment in which there is a reasonable chance for America to stay competitive in the world.

Smart policy will enable us to grow out of our hydrocarbon society, which we are going to have to do. I went to a refinery in Virginia the other day it is an unusual kind of refinery; it is a refinery that refines biodiesel and saw a new C.A.T. engine that can burn 100 percent biodiesel with no exhaust. See, technology is going to enable us to diversify away from our old habits, which will be good for our country, good for our economy. And the United States Congress can help that diversification process through wise policy. Jim Talent understands that, and I am going to keep pushing hard to make sure the rest of the United States Senators understand that. I appreciate the fact that we passed a good, tough budget out of the United States Senate. I hope you appreciate that as well. We have got to show the people of this country that we can be wise about how we spend your money. Notice I did not say the Government's money how we spend your taxpayers' money.

{"id": 5818, "text": "I am looking forward to working with this good Senator to make sure the appropriation process stays stuck to the budget. I am also working on Social Security for a reason. The reason is, is that there is a huge problem looming for a younger set of Americans. I just came from Hopkinsville, Kentucky Hopkington, Kentucky, and I told the people there what I have been telling folks all across the country, that if you get your check, you have nothing to worry about. I mean, the Social Security system is just fine for people receiving their check. But because baby boomers like me are getting ready to retire see, my retirement age shows up at 2008 which is a convenient year. But the problem for younger workers is there is more than just me retiring. As a matter of fact, about 73 million of us are set to retire. And I do not know about the rest of you baby boomers here, but I plan on living longer than the previous generation. As a matter of fact, I am trying to exercise on a daily basis so that I do live longer. And not only that, but we have been promised greater benefits than the previous generation. So you have got a lot of baby boomers living longer, getting greater benefits, with fewer people paying into the system. In 1950 I do not know if you know this or not but 16 workers paid for every retiree. So we have got a problem, folks. It is not a problem for people who receive their check. It is a problem for people coming up. It is a problem not for the grandparents but the grandchildren. And so I think now it is time to do something about it, and so does Jim Talent. And I have laid out some proposals. One of them is, why do not we just slow down the growth rate of benefits for some of the wealthier citizens. Their benefits will grow but not as quite as fast as Congress of the past thought they ought to grow. It is called progressive indexing, which, by the way, will get most of the problem solved. I also think younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own payroll tax and set up in a voluntary personal savings account. Right now the Government gets a whopping 1.8 percent on your money when we hold it in the payroll tax. With a conservative mix of bonds and stocks, you can get at least 4 1/2 percent.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdinnerforsenatorjamesmtalentstlouismissouri", "title": "Remarks at a Dinner for Senator James M.

We believe everybody in this country ought to own assets. We believe everybody ought to have the ability to pass on their assets to whomever they choose. We know that when you own something, you have a vital stake in the future of the United States of America. Now is the time to not only fix Social Security for generations to come but to make Social Security a better deal for all Americans. And when we get that done, we are going to reform the Tax Code. I put together a group of Democrats and Republicans to make some recommendations. I know I will have a strong ally in Jim Talent in making sure the Tax Code is more fair, is less large, and accomplishes the mission, and that is to collect revenues for our Government in a fair, honest way. Do you realize that I read a report the other day where some person estimated from the IRS that there is about $325 billion a year in people avoiding taxes. And part of it has to do with the complexities of the Tax Code. For the sake of an economy that grows and for the sake of a better America, we have got to reform the Tax Code of the United States, and we will. I have got a good ally in Jim Talent when it comes to legal reform. One sure way to make sure this country is not competitive is to allow these frivolous and junk lawsuits to continue to plague people who are trying to run businesses. We got too many lawsuits in America, plain and simple. I want to congratulate Matt for getting good legal reform out of the legislature. We ought to do the same thing in Washington. We got a good class-action reform bill out, and I want to thank Jim for his work on that. I think we are going to get an asbestos bill out here pretty quick, which would be good news. We need one other bill that is really important.

It is estimated that these lawsuits cost the Federal Government about $28 billion a year. Even for all the money we spend, that is a lot. We want people to have their day in court if they get injured by a lousy doc, but we got to do something about these frivolous lawsuits. I proposed a good piece of legislation that is now stuck in the United States Senate. Jim Talent is a strong backer for medical liability reform at the Federal level, and I want to thank him for his support. I remember when Jim ran for the Senate, he said he would be Missouri's health care Senator, and he has kept that promise. We worked together to strengthen Medicare by giving seniors more choices and by modernizing the system to include a prescription drug benefit. Talent understood what I know what kind of system is it where we pay for surgery from a heart attack but not the medicine to prevent the surgery from being needed in the first place? It was an antiquated, outdated system that needed market incentives in the program and needed to be brought up to date for the sake of our seniors. The Medicare bill that Jim helped pass out of the United States Senate is a good piece of legislation that will mean better quality of life for our seniors in America. And finally, an issue I know is dear to his heart is association health plans. You know, too many small businesses cannot afford health insurance for their employees. And there is a practical way to deal with the problem, and that is to allow small businesses to pool risk across jurisdictional boundaries so they can buy insurance at the same discounts that big companies get to do. It is a sensible approach to helping deal with health care costs. It makes a lot of sense. Talent is the author of that idea on the Senate floor, and I look forward to working with him to get association health care plans past. And I want to thank you for your leadership on that issue. There is a lot of issues that we could be talking about here, and he said, when I got up here, he said, Make sure you keep it relatively short. These people paid a lot of money.

You know, I gave a speech the other day at Calvin College, and I talked about Alexis de Tocqueville. He had interesting observations about America in 1832. He talked about the strength of America being in the souls of our citizens and that people were able to find great comfort and solace and strength through civic organizations, voluntary organizations where people come together to help heal the hurts of society. That was true in 1832, and it is darn sure true today in 2005. The strength of this country lies in the hearts and souls of our citizens. And the Federal Government should not fear should not fear the presence of faith to help deal with social problems, as a matter of fact, ought to welcome faith programs and to help deal with social problems. I appreciate Jim's willingness to join me in promoting a culture of life in America. I want to thank Jim for helping defend the institution of marriage from being redefined by activist judges. And speaking about judges I want to thank both Senators from Missouri for understanding that every nominee a President sends up must have a fair hearing in the Judiciary Committee, an expeditious hearing in the Judiciary Committee and then an up-or-down vote on the floor of the United States Senate. I nominated a fantastic woman named Priscilla Owen over 4 years ago to the bench, Fifth Court. She is a fantastic lady, tops in her law school class. In our State, you got to run for Supreme Court, and she ran for Supreme Court, got endorsed by Republicans and Democrats, won something like 80 percent of the State because she is a great judge. For 4 long years her nomination was held up for pure partisan reasons 4 years and finally, as a result of never giving up and being steadfast and strong, she got her vote. I want to thank Senators Talent and Bond for supporting this great woman. We got another confirmation that needs to get done too. It is time for the United States Senate to stop playing pure politics, stall politics, and give John Bolton an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.

He is a strong, strong supporter of our military, and I want to thank you for that. You know, we have a duty to make sure these troops get the best possible equipment and the best possible training. And we are fulfilling that obligation. You know, our strategy is clear on the war on terror. We are going to find them overseas so we do not have to find them face them here at home. We will defeat them there in order to protect the homeland. The only way to defend America is to stay on the offense against these people, and that is exactly what the United States of America will continue to do. One is through good intelligence and good movement of troops and good work with the allies. And there is another way to stay on the offense against the terrorists, and that is to spread freedom. There is nothing that frightens these ideological killers more than democracy. It scares them a lot. They cannot survive in a democracy. They can survive in places where tyrants have discouraged hope, suppressed people. They cannot survive in an open society. See, they cannot stand the light of freedom. One, we will be tough as heck and stay on the offense, but we will also have great faith in the capacity of freedom to transform hateful societies to hopeful societies, to transform the conditions that create hate to the conditions that create hope.

It is fantastic to think about that. I have had a lot of friends go over to Afghanistan, and Karen Hughes was there early on after the liberation, and she went again. I will tell you a great American story. My barber was raised in Afghanistan. And she came over here to there was a revolution or civil war or whatever you want to call it, and she decided to stay in America, raised her three kids here, and used her great talents and enthusiasm for her country to raise money to build two schools.

{"id": 5824, "text": "Well, I just completed a meeting with the Cabinet that is directly in charge of dealing with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. From the beginning, we activated 15 agencies for what is now the largest national response ever to an environmental disaster. And what we wanted to do was make sure that every agency was coordinating and that there was clarity about how we are going to proceed in the coming months. Now, we have gotten reports that have been confirmed by our independent scientists that the top-hat mechanism that was put in place is beginning to capture some of the oil. We are still trying to get a better determination as to how much it is capturing, and we are pushing BP very hard to make sure that all the facilities are available so that as the oil is being captured, it is also being separated properly, that there are receptacles for that oil to go, that we have thought through contingencies in case there is an emergency or a hurricane so that these mechanisms are not disrupted, and that there is a lot of redundancy built in. Even if we are successful in containing some or much of this oil, we are not going to get this problem completely solved until we actually have the relief well completed, and that is going to take a couple of more months. We also know that there is already a lot of oil that is been released and that there is going to be more oil released no matter how successful this containment effort is. And that is why it is so important for us to continue to put every asset that we have--boom, skimmers, vessels, hiring local folks and local fishermen with their facilities, equipping them with skimmers--getting every asset that we have out there to make sure that we are minimizing the amount of oil that is actually coming to shore. Now, there are a number of other issues that were raised during this meeting that I just want to touch on. Number one, when I was down in the Gulf on Friday, meeting with fishermen and small-business owners, what is clear is that the economic impact of this disaster is going to be substantial and it is going to be ongoing. And as I said on Friday--and I want to repeat--I do not want to see BP nickel-and-diming these businesses that are having a very tough time.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingcabinetmeeting10", "title": "Remarks Following a Cabinet Meeting", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-cabinet-meeting-10", "publication_date": "07-06-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

But what we also need is BP being quick and responsive to the needs of these local communities. We have individuals who have been assigned specifically to ride herd on BP, to make sure that that is happening. We want the people who are in charge of BP's claims process to be meeting with us on a regular basis. But we are going to insist that that money flows quickly, in a timely basis, so that you do not have a shrimp processor or a fisherman who is going out of business before BP finally makes up its mind as to whether or not it is going to pay out. And that is going to be one of our top priorities, because we know that no matter how successful we are over the next few weeks in some of the containment efforts, the damages are still going to be there. The second thing we talked about quite a bit is the issue of the health of workers who are out there dealing with this spill. So far, we have seen that onshore, we are not seeing huge elevations in toxins in the air or in the water. But that may not be the case out where people are actually doing the work. And we have got to make sure that we are providing all the protections that are necessary. We have put processes in place to make sure that workers out there are getting the equipment and the training they need to protect themselves and their health. But this is something that we are going to have to continue to monitor, because there are a lot of workers out there, and increasingly, we are starting to get individuals who may not be experienced in oil cleanup, because we are trying to get an all-hands-on-deck process.

And what we are going to continue to strive for is complete transparency in real time so that as we get information, the public as a whole gets information, academics, scientists, researchers get this information in what is going to be a fluid and evolving process. Let me just make one final point, and I think this was something that was emphasized by everybody here, and it is something that I want to say to the American people. It may take some time, and it is going to take a whole lot of effort. There is going to be damage done to the Gulf Coast, and there is going to be economic damages that we have got to make sure BP is responsible for and compensates people for. But the one thing I am absolutely confident about is that, as we have before, we will get through this crisis. And it--one of the things that I wanted to make sure we understand is that not only are we going to control the damages to the Gulf Coast, but we want to actually use this as an opportunity to reexamine and work with States and local communities to restore the coast in ways that actually enhance the livelihoods and the quality of life for people in that area. It is going to take some time. These are resilient people down on the Gulf Coast. I had a chance to talk to them, and they have gone through all kinds of stuff over the last 50, 100 years, and they bounce back. They are going to need help from the entire country. They are going to need constant, vigilant attention from this administration. That is what they are going to get. But we are going to be--we are confident that not only are we going to be able to get past this immediate crisis, but we are going to be focusing our attention on making sure that the coast fully recovers and that eventually it comes back even stronger than it was before this crisis.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingcabinetmeeting10", "title": "Remarks Following a Cabinet Meeting", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-cabinet-meeting-10", "publication_date": "07-06-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 5827, "text": "As you know, we have just had a meeting where we have addressed a number of issues, which I will be describing. First of all, I would like to welcome once again President-the President of the United States to the Palace of the Moncloa, President Barack Obama. I have thanked him, and I would like to thank him once again for coming before the end of his term. No U.S. President had visited Spain for 15 years last time-the last visit we had was 15 years ago. So I would like to thank him particularly. I did it earlier, and I'd like to do it formally. On behalf of all Spaniards, I would like to thank him for maintaining his visit after the serious events that have taken place in his country. And I have expressed our sympathy and our affection for-to all the American people. I have also explained the-this country's situation at this time, especially from an economic standpoint. The President of the United States knows how the situation has evolved in our economy. He showed interest for our country's economy. When the crisis started in 2007, 2008, and when I was already President of the Government in 2012, we went through very difficult times, and now we see that those times have been overcome in spite of some pending issues. Spain is no longer in a recession. Spain is growing; it is the economy which is growing fastest in the EU. In 2015, we had very positive figures, as you know. And 2016 is also positive for the time being, and we hope things will continue like that. We have overcome imbalances. And the Spanish economy has bright prospects if it continues-we continue to have an economic policy to keep public accounts under control and if we continue to undertake structural reforms. We have also spoken about the elections in Spain, the process that has concluded with the 26 June elections. And I told President Obama that I will do everything possible to form a Government as soon as possible. I think that having had to rerun the elections for the first time in the history of Spain was bad news, but having to have a third election would be very negative, and it would affect the economy and also our credibility in Spain and outside . We have also discussed issues on the European Union. We have talked about Brexit. Spain's position in the negotiations with the U.K. will be constructive. I think that is what is reasonable and what makes sense.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingmeetingwithprimeministermarianorajoybreyspainandexchangewith", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy Brey of Spain and an Exchange With Reporters in Madrid, Spain", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-meeting-with-prime-minister-mariano-rajoy-brey-spain-and-exchange-with", "publication_date": "10-07-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 5828, "text": "We have also talked about the refugee crisis and the immigration problems and immigration for economic reasons. Obviously, we have a position, and our position is that problems need to be resolved at the point of origin, and we think that they should be resolved soon-the issue of Libya, the issue of Syria-because that will help us greatly. And I have also told President Obama about what I am doing at the EU so the EU gets involved in resolving problems at the point of origin. A young person who has no prospects in his or her country-who has no prospects to live in his country, who cannot have a dignified life-will do anything he can to leave his or her country and find something elsewhere. So problems need to be resolved at the point of origin, and countries need to be helped. And we have to do it together with the European Union. We have also talked about NATO relations. We have talked about Rota, Morn. And I think things have been done properly with the consensus of most of Spanish society. And that is very good for Spain, and it is also very good for the United States and for all of us who defend democracy, freedom, human rights, and security for people. Bilateral relations at this time are wonderful from all perspectives. The United States is the top investor in Spain-foreign investor. Lastly, we have also addressed the situation in Cuba. We are optimistic for the future. And in Colombia, we wish lots of luck to President Santos because he is deploying great efforts. And we have also talked about Venezuela and the need to normalize the situation. So we have addressed issues which are very important for Spain and for the United States. And I would like to conclude by saying, anyone who wants to hear me, that President Obama is a good friend of Spain's and a good friend of Spaniards. He is honest and a person that we have cooperated with very pleasantly. We would be very pleased if he came back to Spain. Well, let me begin by thanking Prime Minister Rajoy and his team and the Spanish people for welcoming us. It has been an extraordinarily gracious and warm welcome, particularly given the tough situation that we have had at home and my need to rearrange my schedule. I was hoping for a longer stay, but I thought that it was important to make sure that, while I was still President, I visited such an important friend and ally.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingmeetingwithprimeministermarianorajoybreyspainandexchangewith", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy Brey of Spain and an Exchange With Reporters in Madrid, Spain", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-meeting-with-prime-minister-mariano-rajoy-brey-spain-and-exchange-with", "publication_date": "10-07-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And we have shared values and ideals as two democracies. And the United States, given the size of its Spanish-speaking population or persons with Hispanic heritage, I think, feel a special connection to Spain. We-I thought the Prime Minister summarized our conversations well. We meet here at a difficult, challenging time for Europe and for the world. We have a world that is integrating rapidly and presents enormous opportunities. But if our institutional arrangements do not ensure inclusion, if we do not coordinate effectively on economic and security issues, then it can present great dangers, both in terms of our own people feeling as if they are left-being left behind, as well as people from other countries fleeing bad situations, wanting to come here, or engaging in conflicts that create safe havens for terrorism and present future challenges to us. The good news is, is that the relationship between the United States and Spain is extremely strong and we have been able to work together on a whole range of these issues. I am confident that taking the approach that Spain has suggested on the Brexit negotiations, that that can be managed in a way that does not have an adverse impact on economic growth and opportunity for all of Europe, including the U.K., and will not have an adverse effect on the global economy. I want to congratulate the Prime Minister and the Spanish people for the economic progress that is been made over the last several years. It has been a difficult journey, but many of the changes that were taken are starting to bear fruit. And we still have more work to do, all of us, in improving the prospects for young people who are unemployed and creating more innovation and productivity and growth in our economies and making sure that those economies are broad based. So we discussed how we can do that on both sides of the Atlantic. We just both came from the NATO meeting in Warsaw, and I want to thank the people of Spain and Spanish Armed Forces for the outstanding leadership that they provide on a whole spectrum of NATO initiatives, whether it is heading up one of NATO's new joint task forces, the incredible contribution that is provided by the Rota and Morn facilities and the hospitality shown to our forces, the work that the EU and NATO together are doing in the Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea.

And the contributions that Spain is making to training Iraqi military and police so that they can consolidate the gains that we are making against ISIL have been critically important, and we appreciate that very much as well. Outside of Europe and the Middle East, we also discussed Latin America, where we have a shared interest, given Spain's roots and strong relationships throughout the Spanish-speaking world and given the fact that what happens in the southern half of our hemisphere has a huge impact on us. We agree that Cuba offers the potential of new prosperity and new freedom if managed correctly, the process of normalization between the United States and Cuba. Our hope is, is that although it will not happen overnight, that it provides new opportunity for the people of Cuba. Peace in Colombia has been elusive for decades. And the fact that President Santos has been able to initiate these changes and forge a tentative, but very important peace deal, I think, promises greater prosperity and security for all the Colombian people. We are jointly concerned about the situation in Venezuela. And our hope is, is that we can find a way in which all sides can come together, stabilize the Government, and stabilize the economy. And we want to be helpful, although, obviously, we cannot dictate the outcomes in Venezuela. Let me just conclude by saying that I definitely will come back as an ex-President, because Spain is beautiful. But-and I want to thank the extraordinary hospitality that is been shown to Michelle and my daughters when they have traveled here. They love it as well. So I think, as your children get older, they do not always want to spend time with you. But if you tell them, we will take you to Spain- -then it is a good way to bribe them and force them to spend time with you. But as President of the United States, in my formal role, I want to express the warmth, the gratitude, the friendship that the American people feel towards the Spanish people. We share values. We share ideals. We believe in democracy. We believe in rule of law. We believe in the dignity of all people. And our work together across the international stage is hugely important.

Now, I have to say that, as President, one of my goals has been to eliminate waste and cut out duplicative programs to make things a little more efficient, but this might be carrying things a little too far. We have, as you might expect, some big Huskies fans here today, including some outstanding Members of Congress. I also want to recognize your university president, Susan Herbst; your athletic director, Warde Manuel; and Larry McHugh, the chairman of your board of trustees. And of course, you have got a couple of great coaches in what I called when we were meeting back there the grizzled veteran, Geno Auriemma and the new blood, Kevin Ollie, both in the house. I can make that joke now that I have got gray hair. Only once before, in 2004, has one school won both the men's and women's Division I titles. And of course, that was who? This is the women's ninth national title, more than any other women's basketball team in history. For the men, it is their fourth title in the last 16 years, which is twice as many as anybody else during that same span of time. Which makes me think, what is up with you guys? It is just a remarkable thing what these two programs have accomplished. Of course, this season the women went a perfect 40-0, won their games by an average of 34 points, so there was not a lot of suspense during their season. In a championship game billed as one of the biggest in women's basketball history, the Huskies routed the previously unbeaten Notre Dame and gave me bragging rights. It gave me bragging rights to pick them in my bracket. I mean, me and 95 percent of the country. And this marked the fifth time that UConn has finished a season as an undefeated national champion. Of course, a lot of this success belongs to Coach Geno, who has cemented his place as not only a legend in women's basketball, but one of the best coaches that we have ever seen at any level and any sport, period. So we are grateful to him.

You have got Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, who went on to become top-10 picks in the WNBA draft. And, Stefanie, I did not forget that you challenged me to a dance-off last year. Do not think that I do not think that you are going to beat me on that. I also told you the I also appreciate that you told the world about it after the title game. I have daughters in junior high and high school, and for their sake, I will not be dancing too much while the cameras are around. Now, I also have to confess, I did not pick the men to win in my bracket. Of course, neither did anybody else, unless you went to UConn. Look at these guys, they are all raising their hand yes, I went. We were not counting on Shabazz Napier leading the way as the tournament's Most Outstanding Player and hitting big shot after big shot and locking down the perimeter defensively. The Huskies also had huge contributions from guys like Ryan Boatright, DeAndre Daniels, and Niels Giffey, who is not here because he is playing overseas. After the tournament wins over Villanova, Iowa State, Michigan State, Florida, Kentucky, UConn became the first seven-seed ever to win the title. Somebody told me we were Cinderellas, and I said, 'No, we are UConn. That is what we do, bred to cut down nets.' In fact, a sportswriter once referred to him as our future President. I do not know with a name like Kevin whether that is possible. Now, Coach Ollie is doing one other important thing. He is making sure his team hits the books as hard as they hit the boards. And this season, both the men and the women ranked among the Nation's best academically, and that is worth applauding. Both teams have also done tremendous work in the community. They have raised awareness for cancer and autism. They have volunteered at senior centers, spent time with underprivileged youth.

And we have got somebody who I believe is going to go down as the finest Secretary of Education we have ever had, Arne Duncan.

I want to reiterate America's support for the people of Japan, who are some of our closest friends and allies.

Now, I just had a chance to talk with some of your teachers as well as some students, who told me about your all-school project that is weaving the life and music of Duke Ellington into your classes. And by getting students engaged in learning, you are teaching the kinds of skills about how to think and how to work together that young people are going to need in college and beyond. That is what all of our schools need to be doing. And in an economy that is more competitive and connected than ever before, a good job and a good career is going to demand a good education. Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs are going to require more than a high school diploma. So if you want a bright future, you are going to need a college degree or advanced training. And as Arne mentioned, unfortunately, too many students are not getting a world-class education today. As many as a quarter of American students are not finishing high school. The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations. And America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree.

Now, that responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but it begins in our homes. It begins with parents who are instilling in their kids not only a love of learning, but also the self-confidence and especially the self-discipline and work ethics that are at the heart of success in school and success in life. Young people, I am talking to you. I have got a couple of them at home. And the truth is, the world's going to be more competitive, and nobody's going to just give success to you. You are going to have to earn it, and that means you have got to apply yourself. So that you are going to learn at home, first and foremost. All of us have a responsibility not just as parents, but as citizens for giving our kids the best possible education. Now, for a long time we were not sure about how to give our kids that kind of education. Some people thought, if you just put more money into education, that would solve the problem. And then on the other side thought, money does not matter, what we need is reform. In fact, there were those who argued that we should just dismantle the public education system altogether. Rather than working together, both sides remained locked in this stalemate year after year, decade after decade, and nothing much changed. And then something began to happen in States and local school districts. Instead of getting caught up in these old, stale debates, people began to agreeing to agree that, you know what, we need both more money and more reform. We need more resources for the schools, but we have got to reorganize how our schools are doing business in order to assure success for our young people. People began coming together parents, students, teachers, administrators, reformers, local officials and we started witnessing amazing success stories all across America. There is a school in Denver, Bruce Randolph School, that went from being one of the worst schools in Colorado to graduating 97 percent of its seniors last May. In Cincinnati, Taft High School went from handing out only one diploma for every five students to graduating 95 percent of its seniors and preparing them for careers in technology.

Prove you are serious about reform, and we will show you the money. And because it is a competition for less than 1 percent of what our country spends on education each year, Race to the Top has led over 40 States to raise their standards for teaching, learning, and student achievement. And these standards were not developed in Washington, but they were developed by Republican and Democratic Governors all across this country. So we have made enormous progress. As Arne has said, this is probably the most significant education reform initiative that we have seen in a generation. But we need to make sure we are reaching every child in America, not just those in States or districts that take part in Race to the Top. And that is why not only do we need to continue this competition, we have got to open it up. And that is why we need to take the same bottom-up approach when it comes to reforming America's most important education law, otherwise known as No Child Left Behind. We have to reform No Child Left Behind. Now, over these last few weeks, during what we have called Education Month around the White House, I have been traveling across the country talking with folks about education. In fact, we have actually been doing that for the last couple of years. And what I have heard, what Arne's heard, what the rest of my team has heard loud and clear from teachers and students and parents and communities is that No Child Left Behind got some things right and got some things wrong. making a promise to educate every child with an excellent teacher. Shining a light on the achievement gap between students of different races and backgrounds and those with and without disabilities, that is the right thing to do. But what has not worked is denying teachers, schools, and States what they need to meet these goals. That is why we need to fix No Child Left Behind. We need to make sure we are graduating students who are ready for college and ready for careers. We need to put outstanding teachers in every classroom and give those teachers the pay and the support that they deserve. I got some applause for that one. We need to not only hold failing schools accountable, we need to help turn those schools around. In the 21st century, it is not enough to leave no child behind, we need to help every child get ahead.

As Arne says, our kids only get one shot at an education, and we have got to get it right. So that is why I am calling on Congress to send me an education reform bill I can sign into law before the next school year begins before next year's school year. I want every child in this country to head back to school in the fall knowing that their education is America's priority. Let us seize this education moment. Let us fix No Child Left Behind. Now, last week, we got a reminder of why it is so critical that we reform this law. According to new estimates, under the system No Child Left Behind put in place, more than 80 percent of our schools may be labeled as failing 80 percent of our schools. And let us face it, skepticism is somewhat justified. We know that four out of five schools in this country are not failing. So what we are doing to measure success and failure is out of line. In fact, the list of supposedly failing schools is includes schools that are making extraordinary progress, including Kenmore. So yes, we have still got more work to do here at this school to close the achievement gap. I think Dr. Word would agree with that. We have got to make sure that every student is on track. But I mean, we can see here at Kenmore what Kenmore's thriving. You got more work to do, but you are doing fine. So what this means, though, is, is that we need a better way of figuring out which schools are deeply in trouble, which schools are not , and how we get not only the schools that are in really bad shape on track, how do we help provide the tools to schools that want to get even better to get better. That way of measuring success and failure, that is the first problem with No Child Left Behind that we need to fix. Instead of labeling schools a failure one day and then throwing up our hands and walking away from them, we need to refocus on the schools that need the most help.

We are going to have to take a series of steps across a broad range of measures to not only target our most troubled schools, but also raise expectations for all our schools. But we have got to do more than that. In recent years, 15 States have actually lowered their standards to make it easier for their kids to meet the targets set by No Child Left Behind. That was that is a pretty perverse incentive when States say to themselves, you know what, let us lower our standards so that we have an easy time easier time passing those standards so that we do not get punished under No Child Left Behind . That makes no sense. They are graduating ready for college and ready for a career. To know whether our kids are on track to meet that goal, we need better assessments. Now, I want to speak to teachers in particular here. I am not talking about more tests. I am not talking about teaching to the test. We do not need to know whether a student can fill out a bubble. We do need to know whether they are making progress. We do need to know whether they are not only mastering reading, math, and science, but also developing the kinds of skills, like critical thinking and creativity and collaboration, that I just saw on display with the students that I met here. Those are skills they are going to need for the rest of their lives, not just to be good workers, but to be good citizens. But the point is, is that we need to refine how we are assessing progress so that we can have accountability without rigidity, accountability that still encourages creativity inside the classroom and empowers teachers and students and administrators. Of course, we also know that better standards, better assessments, and better curriculum will not make a difference without outstanding teachers. Every day in this country, teachers are doing a heroic job for their kids every day. They are taking on the problems that follow students into class, come in early to rewrite lessons, spending hours after school tutoring students. Now, in South Korea, teachers are known as nation builders, and I think it is time we treated our teachers with the same level of respect right here in the United States of America. But if we are serious about treating teachers that way, if we are serious about educating all our kids with an excellent teacher, then we are going to have to fix No Child Left Behind.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkskenmoremiddleschoolarlington", "title": "Remarks at Kenmore Middle School in Arlington", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-kenmore-middle-school-arlington", "publication_date": "14-03-2011", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 5838, "text": "What No Child Left Behind says is that teachers need to be certified before they step into the classroom. Now, certification can be an important measure of the quality of the teacher, and obviously, we want teachers to be well-qualified. But when the quality of a teacher can make or break a child's education, we have got to make sure our certified teachers are also outstanding teachers, teachers who can reach every last child. And so what we need to do is a better job preparing and supporting our teachers, measuring their success in the classroom, holding them accountable. We are going to have to stop making excuses for the occasional bad teacher. We are going to have to start paying good ones like the professionals that they are. If we truly believe that teaching is one of the most valued professions in society and I cannot think of a more important profession then we have got to start valuing our great teachers. I do not know any teacher who got into it for the pay. The teachers who are here, you got into it for the kids, for the satisfaction of feeling like your passing on knowledge that these young people will use and carry on for the rest of their lives. So we need to reward you by letting you make more of a difference for your kids. give our best teachers more time to learn from each other, more time to mentor each other, more responsibilities in their schools. And to replace the baby boomers who are retiring in the coming years, we are going to have to recruit a whole new generation of teachers, including a hundred thousand new math and science teachers over the next decade. So these are the steps we are going to have to take to fix No Child Left Behind. And together with what we are already doing to make college more affordable for millions more students, I am confident these reforms will help us meet the goal that I set when I took office, which is, by the end of the decade, we will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. So these steps will require reforms. They will require a change in rules and standards and even attitudes. But let me just point out, there is no avoiding the fact they will also cost some money. It requires reform, but it costs some money. Making it possible for families to send their kids to college costs money. I understand that.

That will cut the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, making that kind of spending a much smaller share of the economy, smaller than it is been in 50 years. Right now we are sitting down with Republicans and Democrats to find other ways to get our deficits under control. We cannot cut education. We cannot cut the things that will make America more competitive. I mean, think about what happens in your own family when somebody loses a job or has an illness and you need to cut back. What do you do? You start by skipping that vacation you'd been planning, or you see what is on TV instead of going to the movies. Maybe you start packing your own lunch. There are a whole bunch of things that you might do. The last thing you are going to do is to dip into your child's college savings. You are not going to give that up. Well, what is true for your family is true for the American family. A budget that sacrifices our commitment to education would be a budget that is sacrificing our country's future. That would be a budget that sacrifices our children's future, and I will not let it happen. So yes, I am determined to cut our deficits. But I refuse to do it by telling students here, who are so full of promise, that we are not willing to invest in your future. I am not willing to tell these young people right here that their education is not a priority. I am talking about students like Katherine Diaz, who says, I think I should have the opportunity to be who I want to be. And it turns out that Katherine wants to either be a professional violinist or the first woman President of the United States. She might do both. professional violinist, President.

Sometimes, you get some hecklers. I did have my team look into what other Presidents have done when they visited Alaska. I am not the first President to come to Alaska. Warren Harding spent more than 2 weeks here, which I would love to do. But I cannot leave Congress alone that long. When FDR visited-Franklin Delano Roosevelt-his opponents started a rumor that he left his dog Fala on the Aleutian Islands and spent 20 million taxpayer dollars to send a destroyer to pick him up. Now, I am astonished that anybody would make something up about a President. But FDR did not take it lying down. I do not resent attacks, and my family does not resent attacks. But Fala does resent attacks. President Carter did some fishing when he visited. And I would not mind coming back to Alaska to do some fly fishing someday. You cannot see Alaska in 3 days. I may not be President anymore, but hopefully, I still get a pretty good reception. I am going to-the. And just in case, I will bring Michelle, who I know will get a good reception. In fact, on Monday, Governor Walker and Byron personally gave me a fishing license. But there is one thing no American President has done before, and that is travel above the Arctic Circle. So I could not be prouder to be the first and to spend some time with all of you. Before I begin my remarks, I want to thank our veterans who are in the audience, because we have so many Alaska Natives who serve our country and defend us. And in fact, I have met some World War II vets and Korean war vets. And we want to make sure that they know how much we appreciate everything that they have done on our behalf.

And I heard that you are even teaching them some Iupiaq. They are probably a little better than me. But the teams that advance my trip, they spend a lot of time far away from home.

I have had a chance to sit in the cockpit of a floatplane. But the Secret Service did not let me fly it. I still enjoyed it. We had a chance to hike to the Exit Glacier in Kenai Fjords National Park. I went out on Resurrection Bay and saw dolphins and a humpback whale and otters and puffins. And in Dillingham, just earlier today, I watched Alaska Native fishermen bring in their salmon catch and a tribal elder prepare it in the traditional way. I had a chance to visit a middle school where Alaska Native youth performed a traditional Yup'ik dance. It is on video. So the warmth and hospitality has been incredible, and I am so grateful for it. We talk a lot about the pioneering, independent spirit of America. It is something that we are very proud of as Americans. But what is clear is that, up here, it is not just a spirit, it is not just a slogan, it is a way of life. The-and it is out of necessity. You cannot just drive down to the shopping mall to get what you need. Help, if you need it, is a long way away. This far north, everybody has to look out for each other.

We know that Alaska is big, and sometimes, I have to describe for people in the lower 48, if you dropped it on the lower 48, it would stretch from Florida to California, from the Dakotas to Texas. So the people of Alaska can be just as different as all the differences that exist across America. But even though we all look different and come from different places and believe in different things, we all stand united around some similar values. We all want a chance at opportunity. We all want to be able to pass down our traditions and our culture and our language to our kids. We all want the same chance at the American Dream as everybody else. We believe that every community deserves access to great jobs. And that is why, to boost commerce in the Arctic and to maintain America's status as an Arctic power, we have called for the accelerated replacement of the Coast Guard's heavy-duty icebreaker, and we are planning for construction of more icebreakers. And I am urging Congress to make sure we have got the resources to do this. To boost tourism, I am asking Congress to speed up maintenance and modernization of our national parks in time for the centennial next year, including right here in Alaska. We believe every child deserves a shot at a great education. One of the initiatives I am proudest of is something we call ConnectEd, and it is a program we started to close the technology gaps in our schools and connect 99 percent of America's students to high-speed Internet by the year 2018. And if you want to see the difference this can make in a child's life, look at Nanwalek, on Alaska's southern coast. Like a lot of Alaskan communities, you can only get there by boat or by plane. But today, with the help of Apple, all 80 of its students, most of whom are Native-Alaska Natives, now learn in classrooms with fast Internet and iPads and digital content. Most of these kids do not have Internet at home. But in the classroom, they have got the tools to compete with any child around the world.

I want to make sure these young people know we care about them and we are fighting for them. We believe every American deserves access to quality, affordable health care. And since I signed the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare--we signed it 5 years ago-since then, 16 million Americans have gotten covered. More than 18,000 Alaskans have been able to purchase private plans through healthcare.gov. Thanks to the leadership of Governor Walker and Lieutenant Governor Mallott, another 17,000 are projected to gain access to health insurance under Medicaid next year. So we appreciate that. And that means more Alaskans can get things like mammograms and physicals. It will save this State an estimated $20 million in costs of care for people who cannot afford to pay for it. So it is going to make a difference. We also believe in being good stewards of our land and our planet for the next generation. And that is what I want to spend the rest of my time talking about. One of the reasons I came up here is to really focus on what is probably the biggest challenge our planet faces. If there is one thing that threatens opportunity and prosperity for everybody, wherever we live, it is the threat of a changing climate. I do not need to tell people here in Alaska what is happening. And over the past few years, I have been trying to make the rest of the country more aware of a changing climate, but you are already living it. You have got longer, more dangerous fire seasons in Alaska, thawing permafrost that threatens homes and infrastructure. Melting sea ice that contributes to some of the fastest coastal erosion in the world. I met Alaska Natives whose way of life that they have practiced for centuries is in danger of slipping away. On Monday, one Alaska Native woman told me she does not want her way of life to go on the endangered species list. And I have talked with folks whose villages are literally in danger of slipping away. So on my way here, I flew over the island of Kivalina, which is already receding into the ocean.

If another country threatened to wipe out an American town, we'd do everything in our power to protect it. Well, climate change poses the same threat right now. And that is why I care so deeply about this. If we do nothing, temperatures in Alaska are projected to rise between 6 and 12 degrees by the end of the century. That means more melting, more fires, more erosion, more thawing of the permafrost, more warming after that. And it threatens all of us with hardship, not just people up north. There are not many other places in America that have to deal with those questions right now. And that is why, over the past 6 years, we have been working to do something about it. We are the number-one producer of oil and gas. But we are transitioning away from energy that creates the carbon that is warming the planet and threatening our health and our environment, and we are going all in on clean, renewable energy sources like wind and solar. And Alaska has the natural resources to be a global leader in this effort. America right now harnesses three times as much electricity from the wind and 20 times as much from the sun as we did back in 2008. That is how much progress we have already made. And Alaskans now lead the world in the development of hybrid wind energy systems for remote grids, which help, obviously, villages that are not hooked up to a big power grid. And you are expanding your solar and biomass resources. So Kodiak Island, for example, recently achieved 99.7 percent of its electricity from renewable sources. Its wind power alone displaces more than 2 million gallons of diesel fuel every year. So people are saving money and helping the environment. And today Kodiak Island announced a $3 million public-private partnership that will make the island the first in the world to adopt new technology that lets it stabilize and store the energy it generates from the wind. And I know you guys have started putting up solar panels and wind turbines around Kotzebue. And because energy costs are pretty severe up here, for remote Alaskan communities, one of the biggest problems is high energy costs.

Anchorage became the first city in the world to replace more than a quarter of its roadway lighting with LED lighting, and that saves the city $260,000 a year, cuts its energy consumption from lighting by nearly 60 percent. In the town of Tok, the school district replaced its expensive diesel heating and power systems with one fueled by biomass; saved enough money to rehire the counselor, the music teacher, and the boiler operator. And last month, I announced the first set of nationwide standards to end the limitless carbon emissions from our power plants. And that is the most important step we have ever taken on climate change. So the good news is, we have made a lot of progress in the last 6 years. But I am here to tell you we have got to do more. And for the sake of our kids, we have got to keep going. America has to lead the world in transitioning to a clean energy economy. Now, as we make this transition, we have also got to take more seriously our obligation to help those communities that are already at risk so that they can become more resilient in the face of climate change. Because some of it we are not going to be able to avoid. And so communities are already going to be affected, and that is especially pressing here in Alaska. And that is why today I am announcing that the Denali Commission will serve as a central coordinator in building what we call climate resilience, helping people adapt.

I want to commend you and your colleagues here for the many contributions you make to our national security discourse-including on the challenge that brings us together today. In response to Bashar al-Assad's barbaric use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people, President Obama, after careful consideration, has decided that it is in the national security interest of the United States to conduct limited military strikes against the Syrian regime. President Obama has asked Congress for its support in this action, because in a democracy, our policies are stronger, more effective and more sustainable when they have the support of the American people and their elected leaders. Tomorrow evening, the President will address the nation and make his case for taking action. Today, I want to take this opportunity to explain why Syria's use of chemical weapons is a serious threat to our national security, and why it is in our national interest to undertake limited military action to deter future use. There is no denying what happened on August 21. 30 in the morning, while most of Damascus was still asleep, Assad's forces loaded warheads filled with deadly chemicals onto rockets and launched them into suburbs controlled or contested by opposition forces. They unleashed hellish chaos and terror on a massive scale. Innocent civilians were jolted awake, choking on poison. In the end, more than 1400 were dead-more than 400 of them children. In recent days, we have been shocked by the videos from Ghouta and other neighborhoods near Damascus. As a parent, I cannot look at those pictures-those little children laying on the ground, their eyes glassy, their bodies twitching-and not think of my own two kids. I can only imagine the agony of those parents in Damascus. Sarin targets the body's central nervous system, making every breath a struggle and causing foaming at the nose and mouth, intense nausea and uncontrollable convulsions. The death of any innocent, in Syria or around the world, is a tragedy, whether by bullet or landmine or poisonous gas. Gas plumes shift and spread without warning. The masses of people they can fell are immense. Chemical weapons, like other weapons of mass destruction, kill on a scope and scale that is entirely different from conventional weapons. There is no doubt about who is responsible for this attack.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksnationalsecurityadvisorsusanericethenewamericafoundation", "title": "Remarks by National Security Advisor Susan E.

{"id": 5848, "text": "The Syrian regime possesses one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world. Assad has been struggling to clear these very neighborhoods in Damascus and drive out the opposition, but his conventional arsenal was not working well enough or fast enough. Only the Syrian regime has the capacity to deliver chemical weapons on a scale to cause the devastation we saw in Damascus. The rockets were fired from territory controlled by the regime. The rockets landed in territory controlled or contested by the opposition. And the intelligence we have gathered reveals senior officials planning the attack and then, afterwards, plotting to cover up the evidence by destroying the area with shelling. Of course, this is not the first time that Assad has used chemical weapons in this conflict; we assess that he has used them on a small-scale multiple times since March. Whereas previous attacks each killed relatively few people, this one murdered well over a thousand in one fell swoop. Assad is lowering his threshold for use while increasing exponentially the lethality of his attacks. Assad's escalating use of chemical weapons threatens the national security of the United States. And the likelihood that, left unchecked, Assad will continue to use these weapons again and again takes the Syrian conflict to an entirely new level-by terrorizing civilians, creating even greater refugee flows, and raising the risk that deadly chemicals would spill across borders into neighboring Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq. Obviously, the use of chemical weapons also directly threatens our closest ally in the region, Israel, where people once again have readied gas masks. Every time chemical weapons are moved, unloaded, and used on the battlefield, it raises the likelihood that these weapons will fall into the hands of terrorists active in Syria, including Assad's ally Hezbollah and al Qaeda affiliates. That prospect puts Americans at risk of chemical attacks targeted at our soldiers and diplomats in the region and even potentially our citizens at home. Equally, every attack serves to unravel the long-established commitment of nations to renounce chemical weapons use. 189 countries, representing 98 percent of the world's population, are party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the development, acquisition, or use of these weapons. The United States Senate approved that convention by an overwhelming, bipartisan majority, binding America to the global consensus and affirming that we do not tolerate the use or possession of chemical weapons.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksnationalsecurityadvisorsusanericethenewamericafoundation", "title": "Remarks by National Security Advisor Susan E.

{"id": 5849, "text": "So, the Assad regime's attack is not only a direct affront to that norm but also a threat to global security, including the security of the United States. Failing to respond means more and more Syrians will die from Assad's poisonous stockpiles. Failing to respond makes our allies and partners in the region tempting targets of Assad's future attacks. Failing to respond increases the risk of violence and instability as citizens across the Middle East and North Africa continue to struggle for their universal rights. Failing to respond brings us closer to the day when terrorists might gain and use chemical weapons against Americans abroad and at home. Failing to respond damages the international principle reflected in two multilateral treaties and basic human decency that such weapons must never again be used anywhere in the world. Failing to respond to the use of chemical weapons risks opening the door to other weapons of mass destruction and emboldening the madmen who would use them. We cannot allow terrorists bent on destruction, or a nuclear North Korea, or an aspiring nuclear Iran to believe for one minute that we are shying away from our determination to back up our long-standing warnings. If we begin to erode the moral outrage of gassing children in their bed, we open ourselves up to even more fearsome consequences. Moreover, failing to respond to this brazen attack could indicate that the United States is not prepared to use the full range of tools necessary to keep our nation secure. Any President, Republican or Democrat, must have recourse to all elements of American power to design and implement our national security policy - whether diplomatic, economic, or military. Rejecting the limited military action that President Obama strongly supports would raise questions around the world as to whether the United States is truly prepared to employ the full range of its power to defend our national interests. America's ability to rally coalitions and lead internationally could be undermined. Other global hotspots might flare up if belligerents believe the United States cannot be counted on to enforce the most basic and widely accepted international norms. Most disturbingly, it would send a perverse message to those who seek to use the world's worst weapons - that you can use these weapons blatantly and get away with it. Now, I know that many Americans are horrified by the images from Damascus and are concerned about the devastating broader consequences.

{"id": 5850, "text": "The reason President Obama decided to pursue limited strikes is that we and others have already exhausted a host of other measures aimed at changing Assad's calculus and his willingness to use chemical weapons. So only after pursuing a wide range of non-military measures to prevent and halt chemical weapons use did President Obama conclude that a limited military strike is the right way to deter Assad from continuing to employ chemical weapons like any conventional weapon of war. The fact is, President Obama has consistently demonstrated his commitment to multilateral diplomacy. He would much prefer the backing of the United Nations Security Council to uphold the international ban against the use of chemical weapons, whether in the form of sanctions, accountability, or authorizing the use of force. Believe me, I know. I was there for all of those UN debates and negotiations on Syria. I lived it. Three times the Security Council took up resolutions to condemn lesser violence by the Syrian regime. Three times we negotiated for weeks over the most watered-down language imaginable. And three times, Russia and China doubled vetoed almost meaningless resolutions. Similarly, in the past two months, Russia has blocked two resolutions condemning the use of chemical weapons that did not even ascribe blame to any party. Russia opposed two mere press statements expressing concern about their use. A week after the August 21 gas attack, the United Kingdom presented a resolution that included a referral of war crimes in Syria to the International Criminal Court, but again the Russians opposed it, as they have every form of accountability in Syria. For all these reasons, the President has concluded that it is in our national security interest to conduct limited strikes against the Assad regime. I want to take this opportunity to address concerns now that even limited strikes could lead to even greater risk to the United States. these would be limited strikes to deter the Syrian regime from using chemical weapons and to degrade their ability to do so again. What do we mean by limited? This would not be the United States launching another war. Nor would it resemble Kosovo or Libya, which were sustained air campaigns. As the President has said, again repeatedly, this action would be deliberately limited in both time and scope. The United States has engaged in limited strikes multiple times before. Recall President Reagan conducted air strikes measured in hours against Libya in 1986. President Clinton conducted several days of cruise missile strikes against Iraq in 1998. Each has its own costs and benefits.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksnationalsecurityadvisorsusanericethenewamericafoundation", "title": "Remarks by National Security Advisor Susan E.

{"id": 5851, "text": "But these previous engagements are proof that the United States is fully capable of conducting limited, defined and proportional military actions without getting enmeshed in a drawn out conflict. What do we mean by deterring and degrading the regime's chemical weapons capabilities? Strikes could target a range of potential regime capacities to manage, deliver, or develop chemical weapons. Assad would discover that, henceforth, chemical weapons offer no battlefield advantage relative to their cost to use. And, if Assad is so brazen as to use chemical weapons again, he would know that we possess the ability to further degrade his capabilities. So, in short, this would not be an open-ended intervention in the Syrian civil war. These strikes would not aim to topple Assad or, by themselves, to effect regime change. Like many, I understand the public skepticism over using military force, particularly in this part of the world. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have left many Americans wary of further military action, however limited. But what the President is proposing is fundamentally different. Unlike Iraq, we are not betting on the existence of weapons of mass destruction. In Syria, we have the undeniable proof that chemical weapons have already been unleashed with horrific results. The entire world can see the bodies. True, there are always risks that accompany the use of military force. That is why we are taking a range of responsible measures to safeguard U.S. personnel and interests in the region, as well as those of our allies and partners. In this event, we do not assess that limited military strikes will unleash a spiral of unintended, escalatory reactions in the region. Assad and his allies would be more than foolish to take on the forces of the United States or our allies. They know that President Obama, throughout his presidency, has amply demonstrated he will not hesitate to defend our nation, our citizens, and our allies against direct threats to our security. The limited strikes that the President plans are necessary and appropriate, which is why they have garnered support on both sides of the political aisle. House and Senate leaders have declared their full support. Foreign policy experts from the left, right and center have strongly endorsed such action. President Obama has asked Congress for their support as the elected representatives of the American people, because he knows that investing the legislative branch in our policy choices helps ensure the maximum potency and sustainability of U.S. policy.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksnationalsecurityadvisorsusanericethenewamericafoundation", "title": "Remarks by National Security Advisor Susan E.

And he knows, like all Americans, that we are strongest in the world when we speak clearly and stand together. At the same time, the international community increasingly recognizes that this chemical weapons attack cannot be ignored. The Arab League foreign ministers have called for deterrent and necessary measures. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation has said the regime's attack requires a decisive action. The NATO Council has met twice, and Secretary General Rasmussen has affirmed that the allies agree on the need for a firm international response to avoid chemical weapon attacks in the future. Last Friday, at the G-20 in St. Petersburg, there was unanimous agreement that chemical weapons had been used and that the international norm against their use must be upheld. We gained unequivocal public support for anticipated U.S. military action from partners in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States joined together in a strong statement declaring that the Assad regime is responsible for the attack and that those who perpetrated these crimes must be held accountable. In subsequent days, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary, Croatia, Estonia, Denmark, Romania, and Qatar have signed on to that same statement, and we expect more countries to add their support. Over the weekend, European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton issued a statement on behalf of the European Union labeling the August 21 attack a blatant violation of international law, a war crime, and a crime against humanity and calling for a clear and strong response to ensure there is no impunity. Every day, more and more nations are coming to the same conclusion. With all the attention given to the prospect of limited military strikes against Syrian regime targets, I want to underscore that such action is by no means the sum total of our policy toward Syria. On the contrary, any such strikes would complement and reinforce our broader Syria strategy, which we continue to pursue with allies and partners. Our overarching goal is to end the underlying conflict through a negotiated, political transition in which Assad leaves power. The best way to achieve this is to keep the country and its institutions intact, but all parties have to be willing to negotiate.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksnationalsecurityadvisorsusanericethenewamericafoundation", "title": "Remarks by National Security Advisor Susan E.

{"id": 5853, "text": "So ours is a multifaceted strategy that puts pressure on the regime by isolating them and denying them resources; builds up the civilian and military opposition; and secures diplomatic agreement with other key countries on the principles for transition while assisting those who need immediate relief. Thanks to the generosity of the American people, we lead the humanitarian effort to save lives, having provided the Syrian people more than $1 billion worth of food, shelter, medical assistance, clean water, and relief supplies. In fact, some of the medical supplies used to treat the victims at Ghouta came from the United States. We continue to upgrade and increase our support for moderate, vetted elements of the Syrian opposition in coordination with our international partners. We are building the capacity of local councils and helping civilian leaders to deliver essential services to those in need. We are helping the opposition better serve the needs of the Syrian people. And, we are expanding our assistance to the Supreme Military Council to strengthen its cohesion and its ability to defend against a repressive regime that kills civilians with abandon. Limited strikes that degrade Assad's capacity to use chemical weapons, and thus to kill on a horrific scale with impunity, can also shake his confidence in the viability of his relentless pursuit of a military solution. But, ultimately, the only sustainable way to end the suffering in Syria is through a negotiated political solution, starting with the creation of a representative transitional authority that organizes elections and meets the needs of the Syrian people. A ceasefire and a political solution are also, as a practical matter, the only way to eliminate completely the Syrian chemical weapons threat. That is why we continue to increase pressure on the Assad regime to come to the table and negotiate. Notably, during our discussions in St. Petersburg, we sensed more urgency among key players to bring the parties to the negotiating table to jump-start a political transition. The United States shares that sense of urgency, and our intention is to renew our push for the UN-sponsored Geneva process following any limited strikes. Just as limited strikes would complement our broader Syria policy, so too would they reinforce our broader Middle East strategy. The United States will not take sides in sectarian struggles. We cannot and will not impose our will on the democratic development of other nations.

Rather, we seek a Middle East where violent extremism, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction do not threaten our allies, partners and Americans. We seek the stability of a region that is vital to the energy that helps fuel our global economy. Countering Syria's use of chemical weapons shows that the United States will act to prevent some of the worst weapons in human history from becoming the new norm. It will demonstrate that America means what we say. It will make clear to Assad and his allies-Hezbollah and Iran-that they should not test the resolve of the United States of America. This has implications for our efforts to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. we will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. With allies and partners, we continue to pursue a comprehensive strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, including diplomacy, pressure, and increasing sanctions. And, as the President has said, all options remain on the table. For our efforts to succeed, however, the leaders in Tehran must know that the United States means what we say. If we do not respond when Iran's close ally, Syria, uses weapons of mass destruction, what message does that send to Iran? It risks suggesting that the international community cannot muster the will to act when necessary. It risks suggesting that serious threats to regional and global stability will be left to fester. It risks suggesting that egregious violations of international norms do not have consequences. Make no mistake, the decision our nation makes in the coming days is being watched in capitals around the world, especially in Tehran and Pyongyang. They are watching to see whether the United States will stand up for the world we are trying to build for our children and future generations. And, if we fail to act, they will be emboldened to push harder for the world that only they want-a future where more of the world's most dangerous weapons fall into the most dangerous hands.

This only heightens the sense of vulnerability many in Israel feel about the turmoil that engulfs their nation, and it might make it even harder for Israelis and Palestinians to take the risks for peace. The bottom line is that standing up to Syria's use of chemical weapons advances our broader goals in the Middle East. Conversely, by allowing Assad to act with impunity, everything else becomes even harder-from countering terrorism to defending human rights, from promoting peace to ensuring our energy security and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In closing, allow me to speak, not just as the President's national security advisor, but also as a parent, a mother. Time and again, we have seen what happens when the world fails to respond to horrific abuses on the scale we saw in Damascus. We have seen the even greater barbarism that can follow, whether in Srebrenica or Rwanda or Darfur. I have been to more than my share of war zones. And unlike those tragedies of earlier decades, we have the technology-on our computers and our smart phones-to see the full horrors unfold in real time. Children lined up in shrouds, their voices forever silenced. Devastated mothers and fathers kissing their children goodbye, some pulling the white sheet up tight around their beautiful faces, as if tucking them in for the last time. But where words may fail us, action must not. Every adult American, every Member of Congress, should watch those videos for themselves. Watch those videos, and imagine the months and years ahead where an emboldened Assad and those who follow his example carry out more attacks, forcing us to witness more and more such depravity. that this cannot stand.

We are going to have to say there is no rational distinction between a flea market and a gun show and a gun shop. We are going to have to put 50,000 more police out there in the neighborhoods where the crime rate is still too high. We are going to have to do things that help communities that are driving their crime rates down do it everywhere. But I think the Democrats ought to say, We are not satisfied with the lowest crime rate in 26 years. We will never be satisfied until America is the safest big country in the world, and we think we can help to make it that way. Let us talk about the economy. Number one, not everybody is a part of it; and number two, it is changing so fast, if we do not keep working we cannot keep the growth going. So let me just offer you a few ideas that I think are important. These empowerment zones are wonderful, and I want to get more of them. But it is not fair for all the places that are not part of it not to have some help from us to bring enterprise there. If we have learned one thing, we have got the strongest recovery of the last 30 years, also the highest percentage of private sector jobs. We have the smallest Federal Government since President Kennedy was here. But we have not yet figured out how to bring enterprise to every community that has not been part of this recovery. So for those of us who represent and live in the Mississippi Delta or in Appalachia or in represent many of the inner-city areas or a lot of the small towns and rural areas all over this country or the Native American reservations, I have proposed a modest but, I think, important plan. What I want the Congress to do is to pass laws that give us the same incentives to Americans with money to invest in poor areas in America, we give them to invest in poor areas in Central America and the Caribbean and Africa and Asia and throughout the world. The second thing I'd like to say is that I like what we are doing, hooking up all these classrooms to the Internet, and the E-rate allows us to hook them up in rural areas and poor urban areas.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksnewdemocratnetworkdinner0", "title": "Remarks at a New Democrat Network Dinner", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-new-democrat-network-dinner-0", "publication_date": "06-10-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Bill Clinton"], "gender": ["M"]}}

So why do not we adopt that as a goal, study it, figure out how to achieve it, say we will not permit there to be any digital divide. That is the policy we have taken with regard to our schools. That is what the E-rate's all about. But what if their parents all had it, too? What if their parents had access to that? What if we why should we be content with the economy we have? If we do not reach our goal, it will be a lot better than it would otherwise, and we will keep things going. I think we ought to think of that. Let me just mention two other things. First of all, I want to mention something that may be sort of politically impolite, but one issue in which our caucus, in my view, is still divided too often in the wrong way, and that is the issue of trade. Here is what I think. You see it all over the world today. There is a move toward protectionism all over the world today, even in places that are doing well. Because we have not figured out how to put a human face on the global economy. Because we have not figured out how to tell people that, sure, there will be more dynamism in this economy, but here is what we are doing to protect the basic rights of working families. Here is what we are doing to try to protect the basic integrity of the environment. Here is what we are trying to do to make sure everyone can benefit from this. So our party needs to take the lead in pushing for trade, but for doing it in a way that says we are determined to put a human face on the global economy. Because if we do not , it is not just in America; you see this everywhere. I see it in the Europeans. I see it in Asia again. I see it the economy is now the strongest, here, it is been in a long time, and yet, the impetus for continuing to trade is not there. We have got 4 percent of the people and 22 percent of the wealth.

But why should people break their barriers down if they think America's trying to have it both ways? So I think we have to go back at this. And lastly and I think maybe the most important thing of all for the next generation I vetoed that tax bill that the Congress passed, the Republicans in Congress passed, because I was convinced that if I signed it we not only could never meet our obligations to our children and to our seniors and to our future in our investments in science and technology, I was convinced we would never finish the work of paying down our debt. Now, we are paying down our debt now. And if we stay on the plane that I asked Congress to adopt in the budget, we will be debt-free in 15 years, for the first time since Andrew Jackson was President in 1835. Now, why should the Democratic Party be for that? In conventional terms, we are the more liberal party. Why should we be for that? Everybody in this room who is 40 years of age or older, who studied economics in college, was told that a Government should always carry some debt. We were all taught that. Because we are living in a global economy. You look at what happens to these countries that try to hide their money; people still get it out. Interest rates are set in a global economy. If we get America out of debt, it means that all the Americans can borrow more cheaply. If the Government is out of debt, it means lower interest rates for businesses in this country, for home loans, for car loans, for college loans. It means more jobs and higher incomes. It means when our friends overseas who are not as fortunate as we are get in trouble the way the Asians did in the last 2 years, they can get out of trouble at lower cost. I believe, if we do this, it would do more than anything else we could do to guarantee a whole generation of prosperity. Whatever happens in the future, we know not every day of every month of every year from now on will be as good as the last 6 1/2 years have been, but whatever happens in the future, it will not be as bad as it would have been if we keep getting this country out of debt.

The United States-Japanese alliance is one of the linchpins of our security as well as Japan's, and this gives us an opportunity to continue to deepen that relationship, building off the discussions we have had in Washington. It includes the realignment in Okinawa. I want to congratulate Prime Minister Abe on his recent legislation related to bolstering Japanese defense capabilities, and it will give us a chance to talk about a wide range of threats, both regionally and internationally. I also want to express my appreciation for the hard work that Shinzo has been involved with in building up stronger regional understandings. The trilateral meetings that have been taking place between Japan, China, and South Korea I think are especially important. And Shinzo and I both share an interest in continuing to foster rule of law, supporting international norms in areas like navigation-freedom of navigation and maritime law. And again, this bilateral gives us an opportunity to examine how we can work with some of the regional organizations like ASEAN in order to continue to maintain the stability and-that has been the hallmark of this region and has allowed for extraordinary prosperity and growth. And finally, we will be discussing a wide range of economic issues coming out of our meeting at the G-20. Both of us are interested in ratifying and implementing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has been a major topic of conversation here at APEC and the G-20.

And we are fortunate to have the Secretary of the Interior with us, Manuel Lujan. John Warner, Chuck Robb; Congressman George Allen, and other members of Congress. I am delighted to be with you on this special day. It is an honor to be here with the people of Orange County, for this is the community that nurtured the father of our Constitution, James Madison. Citizens of this county launched Madison's political career, sending him to the Virginia House of Delegates when he was just 25 years old. In 1789, Orange County, almost by itself, provided Madison's margin of victory in gaining a seat in the First Congress of the United States. Here is the home where Madison developed and sustained his deep love of liberty, of religious freedom, economic freedom, intellectual freedom. Here at Montpelier, Madison immersed himself in the historical and philosophic study that shaped our Constitution. And here, he promised his constituents he would work to enact a Bill of Rights. I am especially pleased to announce that our fiscal year '93 budget will seek $1 million in Federal support for the restoration of Montpelier. Two hundred years ago this week, the Virginia General Assembly ratified the Bill of Rights. And with this action, three-fourths of the States had approved the Bill of Rights, thus making it a part of our Constitution. Americans have celebrated all of 1991 as the bicentennial year of the Bill of Rights. And thanks to efforts by schools and foundations and corporations, government bodies, active individuals, we have marked the year with many outstanding educational programs, including a national tour exhibiting Virginia's own original copy of the Bill of Rights. Next year, an exhibit on the Bill of Rights, organized by the U.S. Information Agency, will be the centerpiece of the United States Pavilion at the Expo in Seville. Congress has resolved that we observe the Bill of Rights bicentennial with a Year of Thanksgiving for the Blessings of Liberty. As a gesture of my esteem for James Madison and his home community, I am signing here at Montpelier the Presidential proclamation of this bicentennial celebration. May God bless all of you, and may He always keep the American people free and dedicated to Madison's ideals of a just society.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningtheyearthanksgivingfortheblessingslibertyproclamationorangecounty", "title": "Remarks on Signing the Year of Thanksgiving for the Blessings of Liberty Proclamation in Orange County, Virginia", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-the-year-thanksgiving-for-the-blessings-liberty-proclamation-orange-county", "publication_date": "16-12-1991", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I have been trying to think of something that I could pick out as a mistake, you know, so that we could do better next time. I found on one of my schedules -I do not know who happened to prepare this, but nevertheless, the schedule said, with regard to the first dinner, the dinner that President de Gaulle was the host the second one, as you know, was in Ambassador Shriver's residence, and I was the host there but at the first dinner where he was the host, he was supposed to make a toast and I was supposed to prepare one to him.

It creates hundreds of thousands of high-paying American jobs. It slashes tariffs on manufactured and agricultural goods. It protects intellectual property.

It reflects a commitment by our generation to act in the interests of future generations.

I am particularly pleased that the agreement strongly reflects the commitment of the United States to use the tools of the free market to tackle this problem. It is essential that they participate in a meaningful way if we are to truly tackle this problem. But the joint implementation provisions of the agreement open the way to that result. The industrialized nations have come together and taken a strong step, and that is real progress. Finally, I cannot say enough about the extraordinary leadership of Prime Minister Hashimoto. The people of Japan should be very proud of the spirit and the work that their country's leaders did to make this historic day possible. And the agreement we made is actually, because of the way the details are worked out and what counts against the total, even though we have committed to a 7 percent reduction, it is actually closer to our original position than that indicates. We will make some reduction. We got what we wanted, which is joint implementation, emissions trading, a market-oriented approach. I wish it were a little stronger on developing nations' participation. But we opened the way, the only way we can get there, through joint implementation of projects in those countries.

I think the biggest issue in this campaign is which side of the political divide is going to let you keep your money and which side is going to raise your taxes. Now, we have got a record on which side will not raise your taxes. We have been through some tough economic times together. We have been through a recession and a terrorist attack and war and corporate scandal and natural disasters. We added jobs for 52 consecutive months. It is the longest uninterrupted job growth in the Nation's history. We trusted the American people, and we cut taxes on every American who pays taxes. We have hit a rough patch, but we took the lead. We anticipated the problems. And thanks to the leadership of John Boehner and Roy Blunt, they helped shepherd through over $160 billion of tax relief that will be reaching the mailboxes of the American people in the second week of May. Tax relief has worked in the past, and tax relief will work this time, when we get through this rough patch. Milk expires, taxes increase. And we know the difference. And so will the American people when they realize that 116 million households will see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800 if the Democrats get their way in the House of Representatives. We need a Republican President and a Republican Congress to prevent the Democrats from raising your taxes. It is the most solemn responsibility that those of us who have been honored to serve you have. We must do everything in our power to make sure the enemy does not strike us again. And I fully understood that after September the 11th, that the temptation would be to dismiss any threat; the temptation would be that, Oh, perhaps since we have not been attacked, the threat does not exist.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalrepublicancongressionalcommitteedinner1", "title": "Remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-republican-congressional-committee-dinner-1", "publication_date": "12-03-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

One of the things that we must do is to make sure that the hundreds of people that are out working for you every night to protect you have the tools they need. If the enemy, if the extremists who want to do America harm, if the radicals who want to kill again, like they did before on our homeland, are making phone calls into the United States of America, we need to know who they are calling, what they are saying, and what they are planning. The Congress came together last year and passed the Protect America Act to give our professionals the tools they need. But the threat to the United States of America has not expired. Unfortunately, Democratic leaders in the House are continuing to block bipartisan legislation that would give our intelligence officials the tools they need to quickly and effectively monitor terrorist communications. And they are doing so despite the fact that legislation, good legislation, to give our professionals the tools passed the United States Senate by an overwhelming majority of 68 to 29. Instead of holding a vote on this bill that would pass the House of Representatives, House leaders have introduced a highly partisan and deeply flawed bill of their own. Their bill would put in place a cumbersome court approval process that would make it harder to collect intelligence on foreign terrorists and could reopen dangerous intelligence gaps that we experienced last year. Their bill fails to provide liability protection to companies believed to have assisted in protecting our Nation after the 9/11 attacks. Instead, the House bill would make matters worse by extending litigation for years to come. In fact, House leaders simply adopted the position that class-action trial lawyers are taking in billions of dollars of lawsuits they have filed. We are under threat, ladies and gentlemen, and yet the House leaders blocked meaningful, substantial legislation that will help protect America for the sake of class-action trial lawyers. Companies that may have helped us save lives should be thanked for their patriotic service and should not be subjected to billion-dollar lawsuits. This bill would require the disclosure of state secrets during the litigation process. This could lead to the public release of highly classified information that our enemies could use against us. The Democrat version of protecting America is a bad bill; it is irresponsible. It casts aside the bipartisan consensus that was reached in the United States Senate in favor of a partisan approach that has no chance of becoming law.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalrepublicancongressionalcommitteedinner1", "title": "Remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-republican-congressional-committee-dinner-1", "publication_date": "12-03-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

And that is precisely the strategy that we are following. We are on the offense. Wherever we can find a terrorist who would harm the American people, we will bring him to justice. And this war against the extremists is now being played out on two major theaters. I laid out a doctrine that said, if you harbor a terrorist, you are equally as guilty as the terrorists. The Taliban and did not believe us, and so the United States of America, after giving the enemy due warning, unleashed the fury of a great military. And in so doing, we cleaned out the terrorist training camps from which they launched attacks on the United States and freed 25 million people from the clutches of a barbaric regime. This young democracy is struggling for its very existence against coldblooded killers, and it is in the interests of the United States that we stand strongly with these proud Afghan citizens, that we back them in their efforts, and that we make sure Al Qaida or any other extremist can no longer find a safe haven in the country of Afghanistan. And then, of course, the other theater is Iraq. Removing Saddam Hussein was the right decision early in my Presidency; it is the right decision now; and it will be the right decision ever. And the fight's been tough in Iraq. And for those of you here who are here who have served in that theater, I cannot thank you enough for your sacrifices and your service to the United States of America. After all, they wrote one of the most modern constitutions in the history of the Middle East. Iraqis braved the violence to vote. And yet nearly a year ago, the terrorists and extremists were succeeding in their efforts to plunge the country into chaos. So I had a tough decision to make. I reviewed our strategy.

Fourteen months after I ordered the surge of forces, sectarian killings are down, and Al Qaida is on the defense. U.S. and Iraqi forces have captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key Al Qaida operatives. Progress in Iraq is fragile, and there is no question, it is going to take strong determination to prevail. Yet even the enemy recognizes they are on the wrong side of events. When things were going poorly in Iraq early last year, Democrats called for withdrawal. Today, the situation has turned around, and Democrats are calling for withdrawal. retreat. You might even say that when it comes to withdrawing from Iraq, the Democrats' policy is, stay the course. If we followed their advice a year ago, Iraq would be far different and a much more dangerous place than it is today, and the American people would be at greater risk. And if we followed their advice now, we would put at risk all the gains our troops have made over the past year. The United States Congress does need to act when it comes to Iraq, and they need to stand with our brave men and women in uniform and give them all the resources they need to do their job. And it when it comes to standing with the United States military, there is no greater supporters than the Republicans in the House of Representatives. The struggle we are engaged in is difficult for the American some Americans to really understand the scope and the nature of the battle.

We have got Ambassadors traveling with us. And we have even got the Treasurer of the United States traveling with us. My friend Rosario Marin is now the Treasurer of this great country.

We have been discussing common opportunities and common problems for months. And as a result, our relationship has never been better and never been stronger. I know there are some in this world and our country who want to build walls between Mexico and the United States. Fearful people build walls; confident people tear them down. And I am confident that a strong relationship-and I am confident that good neighbors and a strong relationship is in our Nation's best interests. I have seen it firsthand. Trade between Mexico and the United States has grown to a quarter of a trillion dollars. That means jobs in the United States, and as importantly, that means jobs in Mexico. I cannot tell you how hopeful trade is and how important it is. It is not only important for job-seeking Americans; it is incredibly important for Mexico to grow and to prosper, to develop a middle class for people in Mexico to be able to find work close to home. Oh, I know there is a lot of talk about Mexican laborers coming to the United States. Family values do not stop at the Rio Bravo. There are mothers and dads in Mexico who love their children just as much as mothers and dads in America do. And if there are a mother or dad who cannot find work, worried about food on the table, they are going to come and find work in America. And what we want to do is to have a trading relationship that encourages job creation in America but job creation in Mexico as well. We want Mexico to grow a middle class so the citizens of Mexico can find work to feed their families just like the citizens of America can find work to feed their families. We are talking about migration issues. It is a complex subject, but one that this country of ours must confront and have an open dialog about. And we have made good progress on that important issue.

As a matter of fact, I think it is the strength of America in many ways, and it exists in Mexico as well. The love of family-it is incredibly important for the future of our country.

We have learned again what we already knew, that the strength and the skill of this Command are absolutely vital to the peace of the Atlantic world. We recognize that the mission of this Command is peace.

I know all of us wished it could have come sooner, but as I promised when some of you were here last December, the time is short and the needs are great. Together we can be a mighty force for good. We can show the world that we conquer fear with faith, we overcome poverty with growth, and we counter violence with opportunity and freedom. And now we are making good on our promise. I am proud to stand with you for this celebration on the long-awaited first stage of implementation of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act. Ours is a collective partnership for peace, prosperity, and democracy in the Caribbean and in Central America-a partnership that is born of our shared vision that democracy is a God-given birthright and that faith, freedom, and respect for the dignity of every citizen are the mainsprings of human progress. From the very outset of our administration, we have never wavered in our long-term goal to foster true stability and democracy. And to do so, we must work together to help improve the underlying conditions for economic development. Peace and security in the Caribbean Basin are in our vital interest. When our neighbors are in trouble, their troubles inevitably become ours. What these countries need most is the opportunity to produce and export their products at fair prices. That is what the Caribbean Basin Initiative is all about. It offers them open markets in the United States and initiatives to encourage investment and growth. Far from a handout, the proposal will help these countries help themselves. Trade, not aid, will mean more jobs for them and more jobs for us. The CBI package proposed to the Congress in March of '82 was designed by the governments and private sectors of the region's countries, including those of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. a supplemental appropriation of $350 million to provide emergency balance-of-payment support, the elimination for 12 years of nearly all of the remaining tariff barriers on Caribbean Basin country exports to the United States, and tax incentives to promote new investment in the tourist industry.

Aid levels to the Caribbean Basin have doubled since 1980. The other CBI proposals were an innovative and unprecedented plan to integrate trade preferences, investment incentives, and other measures to encourage the economic and social development of the countries of the Caribbean Basin. We seek to help countries implement free market strategies to stimulate their exports and strengthen their economies by expanding growth. Our original proposals evolved during many months of congressional consideration and the Caribbean Basin economic recovery act was approved on July 28th. And the bill that I signed in August is true to our original intent. I am convinced that over time it will contribute significantly to the economic stability and social tranquillity of countries in the Caribbean Basin. The first element of this legislation is a 12-year, one-way, free trade arrangement for all goods produced in the Caribbean Basin except textiles, apparel, canned tuna, leather goods, shoes, and petroleum products. This marks a step our country has never taken before. It is evidence of our commitment to the economic health of our good neighbors. The second element would allow U.S. citizens attending business conventions in the Caribbean Basin and Bermuda to deduct from their income taxes the reasonable expenses incurred. The Secretary of Treasury is here. Now, these benefits will become all the more important as the vigorous expansion of our own economy brings about an increase in our imports and more and more business travel. As a footnote, you should know that we have 125 Peace Corps volunteers trained in small-scale agribusiness. They are helping small farmers increase and diversify food production for their countries' needs and for winter markets in Europe and North America. Fifty more American volunteers will receive this training within the next few weeks. I was especially gratified that support for the CBI was overwhelming and bipartisan. I offer special recognition to the many Members of Congress who strongly supported our proposals, guided them through the approval process, in particular, Congressman Dan Rostenkowski and Senator Bob Dole. You know, almost a year ago, Dan Rostenkowski took members of his Ways and Means Committee to visit five countries and meet with the Prime Ministers of more than 10 Caribbean countries.

And I pledge to you today that enactment of the landmark Caribbean Basin economic recovery act will be followed by a vigorous implementation effort on the part of this administration. Ambassador Brock will continue as Chairman of our Senior Interagency Task Force responsible for its policy and program development. I am calling on the other Cabinet members who've contributed to the CBI's development to give Ambassador Brock by January 1st their proposals on how to make the CBI the most effective means of expanding economic opportunity in the region. The formal process of designation which the Congress has given me the responsibility to carry out has been with delegations visiting with all the potential beneficiaries. Those discussions have been conducted with the kind of mutual commitment to friendship and good will which has made us all so excited about the future of the region. I am optimistic that we will be extending the benefits of the program to virtually all the beneficiaries by the first of next year. The economic and social development of the Caribbean Basin should be part of a collective effort by the international community. Even before my original announcement of the CBI, we held consultations with the Governments of Canada, Mexico, and Venezuela, as well as with our European allies and Japan. Enactment of the CBI should encourage other donor governments and appropriate international organizations to expand their assistance activities in the region. The problems of the Caribbean Basin region are deep-seated, and reducing them will be a great challenge.

So, I just overrode him and pointed out to the audience what I knew about him, what I'd been told about him, and what a tribute it was to their democracy, of which they are very proud, that he was allowed to say these things in that forum, and yet he would never be allowed to do what he was doing in any of the Communist countries. Well, the audience of more than 1,000 rose in a standing ovation. There was a lump in my throat; must have been one in his, because he sat down. I knew in my heart they were not applauding me. They were not even applauding the United States. They were applauding the principles, the ideals, and the dreams that we all share and which they, the brave Costa Rican people, have had the courage to live up to. I have to tell you a little postscript there, that later the President told me that that Communist member of the legislature was the only member of the legislature that could afford to drive a Mercedes. But if the people of the Americas are given a free choice, they will all choose to be like Costa Rica, not Castro's Cuba. Only a counterfeit revolution builds walls to keep people in and employs armies of secret police to keep them quiet. The real revolution lives in the principle that government must rest on the consent of the governed, and this spirit of democracy and freedom of opportunity is the driving force behind the Caribbean Basin Initiative. We are building together a future of new hope and more opportunity. And I pledge the best efforts of our administration to carry this positive program forward, making it worthy of the ideals and dreams that gave it birth. And now I'd like to ask Bill Brock to make a few remarks. And I thank you very much, and God bless you all.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkswhitehouseceremonymarkingtheimplementationthecaribbeanbasininitiative", "title": "Remarks at a White House Ceremony Marking the Implementation of the Caribbean Basin Initiative", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-white-house-ceremony-marking-the-implementation-the-caribbean-basin-initiative", "publication_date": "05-10-1983", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 5887, "text": "This week we celebrated the creation of 4 million new jobs in America since I became President on a platform to renew the American dream by restoring our economy, empowering individual Americans to compete and win in it, making Government work for ordinary citizens, and rebuilding our communities. Since we started our national economic strategy, our private sector is creating jobs nearly 8 times faster than it was 4 years ago. It has not been easy to make these changes. We had to make some tough decisions to put our economic house in order. We had to break the bad habits that led to mismanagement of our economy and the explosion of our deficit for more than a decade. And we had to break through all of the partisan barriers and political rhetoric that too often keeps us from doing the right thing for the American people here in Washington, DC. Today I want to talk with you about two other historic decisions that call on us to break through partisan barriers and political rhetoric again. For very soon, Congress will vote on both health care reform and the crime bill, two issues crucial to our mission of renewing the American dream. I want to talk to you about two young Americans whose stories are the best arguments I have heard for why we have to fix what is wrong with our health care system and make our country safer again for all Americans. One of those young people is Amanda Stewart from Keyes, Oklahoma. This week, I gave awards to four young people who have done heroic deeds or performed remarkable public service. Amanda was one of them. She was injured in a car wreck in 1990 and paralyzed from the chest down. This wonderful young lady could have given up on life. Instead of becoming bitter or defeated, she is devoted herself to educating other young people not to drink and drive, not to ride with people who do, and to always use seat belts. She is helping others to avoid what happened to her. I met Amanda's family. Her father is a hardworking farmer in western Oklahoma. She has a lovely mother and a wonderful younger sister. She has not had any significant medical costs since just after her accident 4 years ago. The Stewarts have been paying $3,400 a year for a limited health insurance policy with a high deductible. But recently they were told that this month their insurance premiums were going to be raised to $9,600 a year. He is in a different party from me, and he made it clear to me that he does not want the National Government to give him anything.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress585", "title": "The President's Radio Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-radio-address-585", "publication_date": "06-08-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Bill Clinton"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 5888, "text": "But he is got a family to raise, and he has no idea how he is going to keep paying for their health insurance. He said to me that if he could not take care of his family, as hard as he was working, something was wrong in this country. People like Amanda and her family are the reason we have to guarantee private, not Government, health insurance for every American, insurance that is always there. It is time to do what is right by those people. We are going in the wrong direction now. There are 5 million Americans just like Amanda's family who had insurance 5 years ago who do not have it today. Almost every one of them are working people and their children. It is also time we do what is right for young people like James Darby, the 9-year-old boy from New Orleans who wrote me last April. He asked me to do something about the crime rate. He asked me to stop the killing, because he was afraid that someone might kill him. And just 9 days later, walking home from a Mother's Day picnic, little James Darby was shot in the head and killed. Well, 9 days ago, after 6 years of delay, a bipartisan committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives reconciled their differences on the smartest, toughest crime bill in the history of this country and sent the bill back to be voted on for final passage in both Houses of Congress. It took a lot of work. It is a bipartisan effort and has been every step of the way. three strikes and you are out and tougher punishments for other tough criminals; 100,000 new police officers on our streets that is a 20 percent increase all across America; a ban on deadly assault weapons; a law that makes it illegal for minors to own and possess handguns; new prisons to keep hardened criminals in; and billions for new, effective prevention programs to give our young people something to say yes to, not just something to say no to. Nine days ago when the bill was sent to both Houses for final passage, I thought it would pass quickly and be sent to my desk for signing. You see, before the House of Representatives can vote on a bill, it must agree on the rules for debate about the bill. There are 435 Members of the House, and they have to have some rules to limit debate. In shorthand, this is called the rule.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress585", "title": "The President's Radio Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-radio-address-585", "publication_date": "06-08-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Bill Clinton"], "gender": ["M"]}}

It is a great pleasure to have this chance to meet with you more as friends than as representatives of our countries, more for passing a pleasant evening than transacting business. It is inspiring to look around this room, to think of the many languages, cultures, religions, and traditions that are present here tonight. Some might say this gathering is a microcosm of the problems that the world faces but to me this gathering is a sample of the opportunities we have to communicate on a personal level and to cooperate as representatives of our independent nations. This room is occupied by men and women aware of their responsibilities and respectful of the obligations of others. Those responsibilities and obligations are at times in conflict, but our commitment to civility and the proper discourse between nations should never waiver. So long as he touched the Earth, he could not be defeated, but when he lost touch, he grew frail. As long as our governments stay in touch with the hopes and aspirations of our people, the prospects for world peace will be strong. Beneath our diversity, the peoples of the world have similar goals. They look for dignity, peace, freedom, and a chance to prosper. These common dreams will be the source of our strength. George Santayana, an American traveler and philosopher, once said, A man's feet must be planted in his country, but his eyes should survey the world. Well, this is the vision required of each of us and of every world leader. We must uncompromisingly represent the interests of our countries, yet be ever mindful that by our actions, we are determining the future of mankind. In the conduct of your duties, be diligent; in the search for peace, be bold. The people of the world owe a special debt of gratitude to diplomats and their families, who today must cope not only with the frustrations inherent with the profession, but also with personal danger. In the last 15 years, diplomats from over a hundred countries have been victims of terrorist attacks. Fortunately, most have survived those attacks; a few, tragically, have not. Those who perpetrate these dastardly acts should never doubt that every nation considers an attack on any diplomat as a crime against mankind which will not be tolerated in any land. Reflecting on this, we are grateful to the diplomatic community for your courage and your perseverance.

Seeing all of you here today is a particular pleasure for me, because together you speak for some of the causes that are closest to my heart, some of the most important reasons our administration came to Washington in the first place. Some of you are law enforcement officers. Some are civilians who work for victims' rights. Some are fighting obscenity and the unspeakable evil of child pornography. Others are working to prevent drug abuse. In the past 4 or 5 months, I have heard a lot of talk-much of it, to put it most kindly, inaccurate-about our social agenda, particularly as it applies to the courts. Well, if anyone wants to know our true agenda, there is no need to go any farther than this room, because your agenda is our agenda. I do not need to tell anyone here the sad, often tragic story of years of judicial solicitation for every conceivable right of criminals and neglect for the victims of crime, of playing fast and loose with first amendment rights in a way that gave too many pornographers free rein, of fanciful constitutional arguments used to throw out long and hard police work, and of the price our nation has paid for all of this. One way, for example, that we have paid that price has been in the wider and wider availability of pornography. The sale of pornography was once said to be victimless. But common sense should have told us all along that pornography has many victims-among them, children. I read a statistic recently that, in a single day, one dial-a-porn company has received 800,000 calls. I am told that the great proportion of those calls are thought to have been made by children. Let me mention here-and I have recently sent Congress a bill that will make it easier for law enforcement officials to fight obscenity and child pornography. But incredible as it may seem, there are well-meaning people who will oppose it. The most extreme say that the first amendment protects child pornographers as they publish and distribute their products. However well-intended, that kind of extremism should not be allowed to prevail. It is not what the Constitution requires. I hope I can count on your support in getting this bill enacted into law. By the way, we could also use a boost with our criminal justice reform legislation.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksadministrationsupporterschildpornographyandthesupremecourtnomination", "title": "Remarks to Administration Supporters on Child Pornography and the Supreme Court Nomination of Anthony M.

{"id": 5891, "text": "I hope I can count on your support on something else as well, and it is the principal reason that we are here today. Judge Anthony M. Kennedy. Judge Kennedy has been on my short list from the very start. A graduate of Stanford University and the Harvard Law School, he has served 12 years on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. There he won the respect of his fellow jurists and the lawyers who practice before that court. He participated in over 1,400 decisions and wrote more than 400 opinions. He earned the reputation for being a balanced and fair judge and one who is tough on crime and concerned about the victims of crime. Victims' dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system represents a failure of the system to achieve its goals. The significant criminal law decisions of the Warren Court focused on the relation of the accused to the state, and the police as an instrument of the state. Little or no thought was given to the position of the victims. Well, that is a note of compassion and realism that is too often missing in our courts. Realism runs through all his work on the bench. He argued in one dissent, for example, for a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, and saw his position ultimately adopted by the Supreme Court. That was in a drug case, by the way. And for realism about police work, the opinion he wrote in that case sets a high standard. You do not have to read many cases involving illegal drug traffic before it becomes clear exactly what was going on at the residences described by the officer's affidavit. Whatever the merits of the exclusionary rule, its rigidities become compounded unacceptably when courts presume innocent conduct when the only commonsense explanation for it is ongoing criminal activity. Another example of his realism-last year Judge Kennedy upheld a lower court when it imposed the maximum sentence allowed by law against a child pornographer. His opinion focused on the severe psychological harm victims of child pornography endure and the great likelihood that child pornographers will, when released, commit the same crimes again. We need more realism like that on the Nation's highest court. We need Judge Kennedy on our highest court. But let me add another thought here. The Constitution itself is tough on crime; it was intended to establish justice and ensure domestic tranquility. It provides a system for discovering the truth, releasing the innocent, and punishing the guilty, not for subjecting the police to an endless guessing game about the rules.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksadministrationsupporterschildpornographyandthesupremecourtnomination", "title": "Remarks to Administration Supporters on Child Pornography and the Supreme Court Nomination of Anthony M.

Let me start by thanking Jim Messina and Jon Carson and all the OFA staff for the great work that they do each and every day. I have gotten a lot of compliments from a lot of you about the quality of the OFA staff, and I actually concur that they are terrific and passionate about the work that we are doing out there. I just had a chance to talk to some of the leaders from States and communities all across the country who are pounding the pavement and talking to their neighbors and talking to their friends. And the levels of enthusiasm and energy that they projected was inspiring, and it really reminds me of why what I do in the White House matters, because I got folks like that-out on the ground, out in communities every single day-that are counting on me to give voice to the incredible work that they are doing, but also the values that they represent. And I want to thank all of you. As I look around the room, I would not be President if it were not for this room. And there are a lot of people here who are new friends, but there are also some folks here who supported me way back in the day when I had no gray hair and I did not wear a tie. Somebody just showed me a picture the other day, and I looked really young. Most of this is just going to be a conversation. I want to spend time on questions and answers and dialogue and discussion. But let me just make a couple of quick comments. Number one, as I said at the State of the Union Address, I genuinely think this year can be a breakout year for America. We have now really consolidated the recovery. If you look at the statistics-8.5 million new jobs, unemployment rate the lowest it is been since before I was elected; you have got manufacturing coming back; we have made progress on energy, fuel efficiency, carbon emissions reductions; making steady progress in terms of reforming our education system-we are actually poised to make the 21st century the American century, just like the 20th century was.

And yet that is not always reflected in people's moods here in the States. Those of us at the very top have disproportionately benefited from productivity gains, technology, globalization. And the ladders of opportunity for folks who want to work their way into the middle class are not as robust as they used to be. And what I said in the State of the Union was that we have to be focused like a laser on building back up an opportunity society in which everybody feels like if they work hard and if they are responsible, they can get ahead. And that means more jobs; that means making sure people are trained for the jobs that are out there. It means making sure kids get a world-class education. It means that work pays and that not only are they getting a decent paycheck that can support their families, but that they have got retirement security and health care security and all the things that give them a stable platform to live their lives and make sure their kids succeed. So we are doing that. And I have also said that Congress may not be willing to break gridlock during a Presidential year. I am going to look for every opportunity to work with them. But if they are not, we are just going to go ahead and do some work. Today at the White House, we announced two more advanced manufacturing hubs, one in Detroit and one in Chicago, where we are going to take cutting-edge research that is being done on advanced metallurgy and digital technology. And consortiums of universities and businesses are coming together to bring jobs back to the United States of America, attract investment. And we did not have to do that with some legislation, although there is some legislation pending in Congress that could expand it. We did the same thing to make sure Federal contractors are paying their employees $10.10 an hour. We are doing the same thing when it comes to making sure that we have got high-speed broadband in every classroom in America. I already have a commitment that is going to mean millions of students, about 20 million students, 15,000 schools across America, are going to be wired for broadband.

But as all of you know because you were involved in 2008 or 2012, it does not work if we do not have folks on the ground who are speaking out on behalf of these issues and these values. Politics has become so toxic and information is so contested and people are separated from how they get news, that oftentimes to break through, what is necessary is the validation of a neighbor or a friend or a coworker or a family member. And that is where OFA comes in, because it is able to, in very concrete terms, help to generate people's energy and mobilize their interest around these issues in ways that are not abstract, but are very concrete and very specific and that reach people where they live, at the kitchen table, and at the water cooler at work. And that grassroots work that is done also then energizes me and informs the issues that we are going to try to lift up over the course of the next year. So I just want to say to all of you, what you are doing is really important, and we really appreciate it. It is often at the ground level, but it makes a difference. And one final example of that difference that is being made is when it comes to the Affordable Care Act. But as a consequence of some of the folks that have been doing this work on the ground, as of today, we have signed up more than 4 million people through the exchanges. That is 4 million people who have the security of health care, in many cases for the very first time. And that does not count the 3 million who are already able to get health insurance because they are staying on their parent's plan. That does not count the millions who have been able to sign up through Medicaid. So when you have got grassroots folks who are committed and energized like they are, it makes a difference. And whatever issues you care about, whether it is climate change or women's reproductive health or foreign policy or education or access to higher education, having folks who are willing to fight for what they believe in connected to what we do here is really powerful and important.

No one can too strongly insist upon the elementary fact that you cannot build the superstructure of public virtue save on private virtue. The sum of the parts is the whole, and if we wish to make that whole, the State, decent, the representative and exponent and symbol of decency, it must be so made through the decency, public and private, of the average citizen. Davis was quite safe in saying he hoped I had enjoyed my stay in San Francisco. I should indeed be ungrateful, unappreciative, if I were not deeply touched and moved by the way in which the people of San Francisco have received me; and I have enjoyed to the full the two days and a half I have spent here. I have enjoyed it all and I have enjoyed no part more, General MacArthur, than my ride down the line, reviewing the troops with you. Californians are good Americans, and therefore it is not necessary to appeal to them on behalf of the army and the navy. I shall not detain you long this evening. I am promised by Colonel Pippy the chance, after my speech, of meeting and shaking hands with each of you, in the rooms of the Club. I have just got two thoughts, not connected together, to which I want to give utterance tonight; one suggested by something that Mr. Davis said. It is absolutely essential, if we are to have the proper standard of public life, that promise shall be square with performance. A lie is no more to be excused in politics than out of politics. A promise is as binding on the stump as off the stump, and there are two facets to that crystal. In the first place, the man who makes a promise which he does not intend to keep and does not try to keep should rightly be adjudged to have forfeited in some degree what should be every man's most precious possession-his honor. On the other hand, the public that exacts a promise which ought not to be kept, or which cannot be kept, is by just so much forfeiting its right to self-government.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthebanquettenderedhimtheunionleagueclubsanfranciscocalifornia", "title": "Theodore Roosevelt Address at the Banquet Tendered Him by the Union League Club of San Francisco, California", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-banquet-tendered-him-the-union-league-club-san-francisco-california", "publication_date": "14-05-1903", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Theodore Roosevelt"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 5896, "text": "No man fit to be a public man will promise either the impossible or the improper; and if the demand is made that he shall do so it means putting a premium upon the unfit in public life. There is the same sound reason for distrusting the man who promises too much in public that there is for distrusting the man who promises too much in private business. If you meet a doctor who asserts that he as a specific remedy that will cure all the ills to which human flesh is heir, distrust him, He has not got it. If you meet the business man who vociferates that he is always selling everything to you at a loss, and you continue to deal with him I am glad if you suffer for it. Any man who promises as a result of legislation or administration the millennium is making a promise which he will find difficulty in keeping. Any man who asserts that by any law it will be possible, out of hand, to make all humanity good and wise, is again promising what he cannot perform. It is indispensable that we should have good laws and upright and honest and fearless administration of the laws; and we are not to be excused if we fail to hold our public men to a rigid accountability if they fail, in their turn, to see that we have proper legislation and proper administration. No public man worth his salt will be other than glad to be held accountable in that fashion. But important though the law is, though the administration of the law is, we can never escape having to face the fundamental truth that neither begins to be of the decisive importance that the average individual's character is. In the last analysis it is the man's own character which is and must ever be the determining factor in his success or failure in life , and therefore in the last analysis it is the average character of the average citizenship of a nation which will in the long run determine whether that nation is to go up or down. The one indispensable thing for us to keep is a high standard of character for the average American citizen.

I have very great confidence in the capacity of our average soldier or sailor to turn out well, to do admirably when put to the supreme test. But the best man alive, if untrained, if unfitly armed, may be beaten by a poorer man who has had the training and the arms. There is nothing more foolish, nothing less dignified than to indulge in boastfulness, in self-glorification as to the capacity of our soldiers and sailors while denying them the material which we are in honor bound to give them in order that their splendid natural qualities shall be fitly supplemented. I have seen our people send American volunteers against a European soldiery, that , European soldiery armed with the finest type of modern rifle and ours with an old black-powder weapon, which was about as effective as a medieval cross bow; and those who failed to prepare the proper weapons for our people are not to be thanked, because by making drafts of an extraordinary kind upon the other good qualities of the American soldier, we escaped disaster. It is very easy and worse than foolish, it is wicked, to hold the people who at the moment are obliged to use those weapons responsible when the real responsibility lay with the representatives of our people and our people themselves for failing to make the preparation in advance. The business of finding a scapegoat to send loose into the wilderness is neither honorable nor dignified for a self-respecting people to be engaged in. We commemorated today by a monument a great naval victory. We commemorated thereby the foresight, the prudence of the public men, of the great business men, of the shipwrights, the men who worked physically at the armor, the guns, the engines, the hulls, in getting the fleet ready; and, more than that, we commemorated the men who trained that fleet in readiness.

And our Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, has got a few things we are going to build. Ben Cardin, who is been a friend for a long time; and Chris Van Hollen, who is a really close friend; and an outstanding Congressman, Anthony Brown, and other elected officials that are here. Look, all of whom fight for working people, in Maryland and in every-and every other State. Because if it happens here, it happens around the world-happens around the country. It is been an honor to be with the ironworkers of Local 5. And we talk about building a future that is made in America. We are talking about you.

And the Executive order I am going to sign today is going to help ensure that we build a better America, we build it right and we build it on time and we build it cheaper than it would have been otherwise. You know, the Executive order is making sure that Federal construction projects get completed on time and under budget, saving taxpayers money, clearing construction zones quickly, and ensuring that everything the Federal Government signs to contract to build is built to last. You guys really, genuinely, are the best in the world. To do that, we are using a tool that ironworkers here know very well, called project labor agreements. I know you all know it, but folks who may be watching this may not fully understand it. Simply put, these are agreements that contractors, subcontractors, and unions put in place before a construction site gets underway, before the construction begins. They ensure that major projects are handled by well-trained, well-prepared, highly skilled workers, and they ward off problems. They resolve disputes ahead of time, ensuring safer work sites, avoiding disruptions and work stoppages that can cause expensive delays down the line. And that makes a big difference for the American taxpayer. Because when big construction projects are completed efficiently and with the highest degree of professionalism, it is good for the American taxpayer. We do not talk about it though. We do not talk about how you all save the American taxpayers money. It is good for families who live in those communities. All across the country, the Federal construction projects are being built as I speak. And it means that modernization of your local waterways will get done sooner, will not cost twice as much as expected. And when the next storm comes, the power will more likely stay on and homes and businesses will be better protected from flooding. It means new air traffic control towers at the local airports will be up and running more quickly, so flights are safer at the airports and more efficient. It means new housing will be built on our military bases; will be of the highest quality, which these servicemembers deserve. It will hold up better and make life easier for our military families.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningexecutiveordertheuseprojectlaboragreementsforfederalconstruction", "title": "Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on the Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects in Upper Marlboro, Maryland", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-executive-order-the-use-project-labor-agreements-for-federal-construction", "publication_date": "04-02-2022", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Joseph R.

So when that bridge collapsed-and it was well over a hundred feet off the-two-almost two-I do not -I did not -I do not know the exact, but probably from down to the creek that it went over and the ravine, probably a couple hundred feet.

Fortunately, no one was killed, but for a snowstorm. Just imagine the challenges we face and the opportunities to build a better America, and extend it far beyond roads and bridges now that we can-know we have to do. We passed that infrastructure bill.

And I said on that night that this was not the end, but rather, it was the beginning. Because what we understood even then was that our country had reached a crossroads. That we had a series of decisions that were going to help determine the future not just of our children, but our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren. That we were living in an age in which the world had shrunk; it had become more interconnected than ever before. And that if we did not make some critical decisions now, if we stopped just kicking the can down the road, but we decided that we were actually going to seize the moment and transform our education system and finally fix our health care system and deal with our energy policy so that we were no longer subject to the whims of the spot oil market, and if we did not transform our foreign policy to recognize the visions and dreams of billions of people around the world who were yearning to be free--if we did not make some fundamental changes, that we might be the first generation that was passing on an America that was less hopeful, that was less generous, and that all those people who felt the American Dream slipping out of their fingers, that somehow that loss of hope would continue.

And it was not until a few months after my Inauguration that we realized we would ultimately lose 8 million jobs before any of our economic plans had a chance to take effect, the worst recession since the Great Depression. And there are families all across the country that are still suffering from the aftershocks of that. And in some cases, the actions we took were not always popular. But we knew that it was vital for us to act boldly and swiftly to address the crisis. And let us take a look at what we were able to accomplish. An economy that was shrinking by about 6 percent has now grown for five consecutive quarters. An economy that was shedding jobs every month now has seen over 2 million jobs created just in the last 14. An auto industry that some had written off now are making profits again and have hired back all their workers. We got the economy moving in the right direction. And along the way, we did a few other things. Along the way, we did a few other things. We decided that we did not want equal pay for equal work to be just an empty slogan, so we strengthened laws to make sure that our daughters are treated as well as our sons. We decided that in a nation as wealthy as ours, it was unacceptable for people to go bankrupt just because they got sick. And so after 100 years, we finally delivered on the promise of making sure that we had affordable, accessible health care in this country for all people. We made record investments in clean energy, record investments in basic research, and restored science to its rightful place. We made the largest Federal investment in education in our history, but we did not just put more money in. We decided we were finally going to deliver on reform and help catalyze reforms in 40 States all across the country to make sure that schools are doing right by every single student, K through 12. And we also made sure that young people are able to afford to go to college, so we took away billions of dollars of subsidies that were going to banks and put those in the student loan system so that millions more young people were able to go to college without taking on tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of debt.

And we have restored around the world a sense of America as a responsible actor that will uphold the principles of human rights and liberty and democracy. And in between, we have dealt with pirates and-- --do you remember? Remember pirates-- --H1N1 and an oil spill and locusts? And I could not be prouder of our record over the last 2 years. Promises were made during the campaign, and so many promises have been kept. And yet, all across America, folks are still struggling. We have been able to avert the worst possible crises, but a lot of those challenges that we confronted in 2008, those challenges are still out there. Wages and incomes have flatlined for the middle class all across America. The rates of poverty in too many communities are way too high. In too many schools, too many of our children still drop out without hope, without vision for the future. We still do not have an energy policy in this country that is equal to our potential and our greatness. And we are still vulnerable to high gas prices that are just killing families all across America right now. We still have not reformed our broken immigration system. So we have too many people living in the shadows, being exploited by workers, driving down the wages of workers as a consequence, because those employers are not subject to the rules. And families are being broken up in the process. We still have not fully transformed our economy so that we are competitive the way we need to be and are creating jobs at the pace we need and growth at the rate that we need.

I gave a budget address a while back, and a lot of people reported on the numbers and the debt and the deficit and why this is so important. And let me tell you, we as Democrats, we as progressives, need to be just as concerned about the debt as anybody else.

I knocked on his window, told him who I was, and said I had come all the way down here from Hot Springs, Arkansas, and all I cared about was music. I did not want to drink anything; I did not want to gamble; I did not want anything; I just wanted to go hear him play. He took me in and put me on the front table. It is funny what you remember, is not it? I have never forgotten that, and that sort of embodies the generosity that the people of this city and this State have exhibited to me throughout my life.

And we went through that campaign, and I found that, to a remarkable degree, we shared the same philosophy. We were proud members of the Democratic Party, but we did not like the fact that our party had been a part of the leadership of 12 years of Republican Presidents when we had the majority in the Congress, and together they quadrupled the debt of the country; and that we were in a terrible recession. Wages had been stagnant for more than a decade. We did not like the fact that people thought because we believed in the United States Constitution and we were against racial discrimination, that somehow we were soft on crime or we thought able-bodied people should not work instead of being on welfare. We thought that the Democratic Party, and African-Americans in general, had been twisted and distorted and used as political whipping boys in campaigns. And we thought Washington was divided by gridlock, and we wanted a change. So I said, give me a chance to change America, to change the direction of the country, change our party, to change our leadership in Washington. I want America in the 21st century to be a place where every person, without regard to race, creed, gender, or anything else, has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. And I want America to be the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and justice and prosperity. And my strategy for getting there is to do everything I know how to do to give opportunity for all, demand responsibility from all Americans, and create a community of all Americans. That is what we said we'd do. Now, in 1992, it was an argument. And the people decided to give me a chance, even though I was, in the rather disparaging characterization of the incumbent President, just a Governor from a small southern State. The people decided to give me a chance. They bought our side of the argument. By 1996, there was no argument anymore because the results were beginning to pour in.

And I say that to make this point-and along the way, by the way, with the HOPE scholarship and other financial incentives, we have opened the doors of college to virtually every American. The air is cleaner; the water is cleaner; the food is safer; 90 percent of our kids are immunized against serious childhood diseases for the first time; 100,000 young Americans have served in AmeriCorps in their communities all over this country, including this one, and earned some money for college.

Number one, all this started with one vote in August of 1993. The economy started getting better after the election, as soon as I announced my economic plan. But it did not get voted on in Congress until August, because it was fairly controversial. I had cut hundreds of programs but dramatically increased education. And I asked the wealthiest Americans to pay more taxes, and cut taxes on 15 million Americans who were working for modest wages, lower wages, with children in their home. And there was a lot of controversy, and the Republican Party in Congress decided that they would vote against this to the person, that they would not give me one vote, and that they would tell everybody it was a just a tax increase, even though they knew only a tiny fraction of Americans were going to have one. Now, that bill passed by one vote in the United States Senate, Al Gore's vote. And it passed by one vote in the United States House of Representatives.

Get guns out of the wrong hands; put more community police on the street; give our kids something good to do. And I am grateful to Bill Jefferson for supporting my education agenda every step of the way, including our plan to hire 100,000 more teachers to get class size down in the early grades, something he is running on; our plan to build or modernize 6,000 schools, which would include his commitment to air-condition the schools that do not have it; our plan to triple the number of our young people who are eligible for after-school programs; set high standards for failing schools, and if they do not turn around, let the parents go to another public school with their kid, but help the schools turn around. We can do that. I have seen that all over America. I am telling you, I have been in the schools in the worst neighborhoods you can imagine in terms of adversity, and I have seen children learning at a high level because of what was done in the school. So, yes, I am grateful to Bill Jefferson. And a lot of what we enjoy today came as a direct result of policies he supported that he played a critical role in bringing to bear. The second point I'd like to make to you is that I believe I am the only person in this room who has actually been a Governor. I know something about this. And I did it quite a long time. I served for 12 years and would have served for 14 if the people had not elected me President. And I am telling you, I loved every day of it. It is a wonderful job if you love people and if you care about good schools, good jobs, and creating strong, healthy, vibrant communities. We have done more in the education area probably than any administration, certainly since the Johnson administration. But most of the money for schools and most of the direction for schools, by State constitutional law, comes from the State, in every State in America. You know, education is very important to me, personally, and to Hillary and to all of our administration.

{"id": 5911, "text": "But a Governor has no more important job, none, than education. And a Governor also has to be able to get people together to really get things done. What you want in a Governor is somebody who is smart, committed, with a good heart, who is passionate about what he or she believes but is not particularly partisan. And I can tell you, Bill and I-we all came out of State Government; he and I both did. We are both, frankly, mortified by how partisan that crowd is in Washington. I mean, I always tell him there is plenty of things for us to argue about in the next election, but the people give us a paycheck every 2 weeks to show up for work in the meanwhile. And we are not supposed to fight about everything; we are supposed to work out things and get things done. That is the sort of person he is. And he has a lot of friends in the Congress who are Republicans because they know that he has not responded in kind to the harsh partisanship of their leaders and that he is still willing to work with people of good will to get things done. You cannot be a good Governor unless you are both open to people in both parties but absolutely aggressive in what you believe and what you want to achieve. You need both an agenda and an ability to bring people together. He can do that. And I did this for 12 years; I am telling you, this is important, and he can do it superbly well. The other thing that has not been mentioned-Vic talked about his service in the legislature-he was twice voted, twice, the best member of the Louisiana Legislature. So he knows about this job. I want to thank Anne and Stan and Chris Rice for having us in this magnificent facility. But this facility used to be an orphanage, and I got to thinking, Hillary and I had a very moving event at the White House this week to celebrate our attempts to move people, kids from foster care into adoption, and all the work we have done over the last 7 years-one thing we have done, by the way, on a bipartisan basis-to speed up adoptions. And I got down here today, and when I was over at the school, a woman stopped me and said, Mr. President, thank you for helping to fix the adoption laws. I just adopted two children.

He knows what it is like to have the support of a good family. He knows what it is like to build a good family, and he and his wife have five magnificent daughters who have done superbly well because they have good parents and a good home. In the end, having now served 12 years as a Governor and 7 years as President, I can tell you, a lot of times you have to make decisions that nobody is smart enough to make. A lot of times decisions come to me that, no matter how smart I think I am, I cannot think my way through. And all you can do is pray to God to give you the wisdom to do it, and listen to your heart, not your head. So the last thing I will say is, remember everything-the man has proven he is had the courage to take a tough decision. He cast a decisive vote on the most important bill that brought us the prosperity we enjoy today. He has wide experience in State Government. He has the capacity to get people together. He clearly has the right agenda. There is no more important agenda for Louisiana's future than getting the education up to world-class levels. But when it is all said and done, what really counts is, do you have a good heart. Keep in mind, 50 years later I still remember my mother loved me enough to kneel down on those railroad tracks and cry when I had to go away. When it is all said and done, you do not remember first and foremost in the last moments of your life the honors you had, the riches you had; you remember who you liked and who you loved, how it felt when the seasons changed, and what it felt like to be really, really important, to matter in the lives of other people. The people of Louisiana will matter to Bill Jefferson if he is the Governor. You should only vote for him if you think he'd be the best Governor. But if you think he'd be the best Governor and you let him be defeated, it would be a terrible thing, because the children here, the children of this State deserve the very best person they can get in experience, in mind, and in heart.

First, when the Vice President got really warmed up- -I thought to myself, first, it will become slightly obvious to this audience that he and I come from a little further south in the United States. And then I was thinking, when he really got going, I wish I had people walking the aisles passing the plate. Anyway, the second thing I thought in the midst of this wonderful event was that I wish that I could take the Pep Band with me for the next month or two wherever I go. I want to say to Chancellor Aiken and President Stukel and Mayor McCollum, Mayor Satterthwaite, Congressman Ewing, Senator Durbin, and Senator Moseley-Braun, Secretary Riley, and Mr. Vice President, I am delighted to be here. I have spent a lot of time in Illinois in the last 7 years, and this State has been very good to me in many ways. The Vice President has been here a lot, and Hillary came and got a honorary degree and was able to speak here. And I have heard from also our families, friends what a wonderful place this is. I do not know how, with all my roaming across America, I have never lit down here before, but I am sure glad I got here today. And I thank you for making me feel so welcome. If you heard the State of the Union last night or just listened to the Vice President here today you know that-you know there is a reason we are here, because you represent, both all of you individually and this great institution, what we are trying to build for the future of America. Last night I talked about all the changes that have occurred just in the last few years. We have had one foot in the 21st century for quite some time. The generation living today has lived through more changes in more different areas in a shorter time than virtually any generation in the history of this country. And when the Vice President and I took office, we were committed to trying to make America work again, to try to fix the things that just were not working for ordinary people, and then to free us up to sort of imagine the future and take the steps that were necessary to get us to the future we want to build. How can we strengthen this country for the 21st century?

{"id": 5914, "text": "Now, I do not want to go over everything that was said, and besides that, I cannot do as well as the Vice President. He must have gotten 30 more minutes sleep than I did last night. But I want to talk to you about just two or three things that I think we should be thinking about for tomorrow. Let me begin with a bit of history, and your chancellor mentioned it earlier, or ENTITY did. Shortly before-shortly after Abraham Lincoln was elected President, Congressman Justin Morrill, from Vermont, asked his colleagues to help him create a system of land grant colleges. It was in the middle of the Civil War, and frankly, most of them thought he was nuts. You know, people were worried about the survival of the Union. But Abraham Lincoln was always worrying about other things, even in the middle of the Civil War. At night, when I work in the White House, I go to an office that I have had restored to the way it was in the mid-1800's. And I remember that that room was Abraham Lincoln's waiting room during the Civil War. And all during the Civil War, at certain appointed hours, he kept a time apart to meet with ordinary citizens. If you wanted a job in a post office in Baltimore in 1862, if you came at the appointed day, at the appointed hour, you could walk up to the room that I go into every night, and sit there, and Abraham Lincoln would see you; ENTITY would see you and listen to you tell why you wanted a post office job. And when he was asked why he did this, he said, I have to remember that people are concerned about other things, and I want this war to be over so all of us can go back to thinking about things like that. So he always thought about what life would be like when the war was over. And he was open to this. In 1862, Morrill's bill passed, and President Lincoln signed it into law. It became one of the wisest investments our Nation ever made, and the University of Illinois, here, was one of the original land grant colleges under that Morrill Act. It is played a dramatic role in helping to shape our Nation. You heard and you were cheering about all the Nobel Prize winners and all that. The Vice President pointed out that it was here that the transistor was invented; Jack Kilby, class of '47, co-invented the microchip.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheuniversityillinoischampaignurbanaillinois", "title": "Remarks at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-university-illinois-champaign-urbana-illinois", "publication_date": "28-01-1998", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 5915, "text": "NCSA, headed by Larry Smarr, launched a billion-dollar browser industry. Illinois and other land grant colleges have literally led our way into the information age. And it all stemmed from something somebody did in 1862 that no one could have imagined would one day have led to all you see around you. I think Lincoln would have liked the Pep Band. But he could not have imagined it. So that is what we have been trying to do. And you heard the Vice President say that basically our view was-the first thing we had to do was we had to get rid of the deficit, but we had to do it in a way that would enable us to invest in our future. We had to shrink the Government, but we had to do it in a way that would allow us to be more active in the areas that were important to our future, that would help to bring us together and widen the circle of opportunity. Now, as you look ahead, I'd just like to mention three things today that I think the University can have a major impact on, two directly and one indirectly. First, we should look to the millennium to try to speed the pace of scientific and technological advances in ways that benefit all of us. So I proposed last night a huge increase in medical research, an increase in the National Science Foundation, a doubling of the National Cancer Institute, because I believe we have enormous opportunities there, and you should be a part of that. I think it is highly likely that many of you who will be having children in the next 3 or 4 years will have children that will live into the 22d century because of the work that will be done in places like the University of Illinois. The second thing that I think we should think about is we should reaffirm our commitment to the exploration of outer space. I talked a little about the international space station last night and about Senator John Glenn at 77 years old going back into space. It is so thrilling, and I know all of you are happy about that. But we are learning a lot from our work in space about how our bodies work here on Earth and about how our environment works here on Earth and how it might be better preserved. And so I ask all of you to continue to support the work we are doing there. And finally, I'd ask you to support, as the Vice President said, this next generation Internet.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheuniversityillinoischampaignurbanaillinois", "title": "Remarks at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-university-illinois-champaign-urbana-illinois", "publication_date": "28-01-1998", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

I mean, that gives you some sense of the speed of change. So we are trying to develop the next generation Internet, and Larry Smarr is helping us, and if it works, it will work about 1,000 times faster than the present one does. I do not know how we can absorb any more speed in information, but we have to be able to. We have to maintain public support across party lines and regional lines and age lines and race lines and all kinds of lines for investments in the future. We always have to be trying to shape the future, and we need your help to do that. Now, the second thing that I want to emphasize is that I want all of you to support the proposition that we have to make, in the years ahead, a college education as universal as a high school education is today. Now, why do I say that? Already it is perfectly clear from looking at all the census figures that any young person who has at least 2 years of college or more is highly likely to get a job with growing income prospects and high stability and the prospect of positive change in the future. Now, a young person with less than 2 years of college is highly likely to be in a job where income increases do not keep up with inflation, subject to changes which may be unstable and not positive. We have to create a network of lifetime learning. We have to, first of all, make our elementary and secondary education as excellent as our higher education is today so more people will be prepared to go to college. But then we literally-we have got to make sure that college is open to all. Now, as the Congressman said, 1997 was the best year for education in a generation, and I believe, clearly, the best year since the GI bill was passed. If you listen to all the things that were done-and I will just litanize them for you-I think you can make a compelling case that the doors of college have been opened to everybody who will work for it. 220,000 new Pell grant scholarships and the maximum amount increased; 300,000 new work-study positions; 50,000 AmeriCorps slots for people who do community service work and earn money to go to college.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheuniversityillinoischampaignurbanaillinois", "title": "Remarks at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-university-illinois-champaign-urbana-illinois", "publication_date": "28-01-1998", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

The first 2 years of college, virtually all Americans are eligible for a $1,500 tax cut to pay for tuition in the first 2 years of college, the HOPE scholarship; and then another tax credit for the 3d and 4th years of college, for graduate school, and for further job training-a lifetime learning credit. But what I want to say to you is, all of you who are here, I came here to ask, as a great university, in whatever service groups you are in, in whatever family or neighborhood or church networks you have, you need to get this message out to people who are coming on behind you. We need every child in this country to know that if he or she works hard and learns what they are supposed to learn, they can all go to college now. And we need them there for our future in the 21st century. Now, the last thing I want to ask your help on in the coming year, because we are going to have a big dialog about it, is something that all of you students probably never think about, and that is Social Security and your retirement. I do not know about you, but when I was your age, I never thought about it. The older you get, the faster time goes. I never will forget, once, a few years ago, I saw a man who was 76 years old at an airport meeting his brother, getting ready to go to his sister's funeral. And I said, What are you thinking about? He said, You know, Bill, it does not take long to live a life. I say that to say that even the young must care for the future, even the young must think about their obligations to generations yet unborn; that America must work as a seamless web of community, always doing what is best for today and tomorrow. Now, what is that got to do with Social Security? There are polls that say that young people in their twenties think it is more likely that they will see UFO's than that they will ever collect Social Security.

{"id": 5918, "text": "It is not in trouble today; nobody today has got any problems drawing their money. In fact, today we collect more money in Social Security taxes every year, quite a bit more, than we pay out. The problem is that when the baby boomers retire-starting with me, I am the oldest of the baby boomers-people my age and down about 18 years younger, we are the largest group of Americans that have ever lived, except the group that started first grade last year-second grade, or third grade, whatever it is, something in grade school-because we have got more children in schools now, public schools, than we had during the baby boom generation for the first time. But we are going to have 18, 20, 25 years where there will be a huge number of people on Social Security in their retirement years, compared to the people who are paying in. Now, the question is, what is the best way to prepare for the retirement of the baby boomers in ways that do not either rob those people who need it of their secure retirement or impose intolerable burdens on our children, who, in turn, will be burdened in raising our grandchildren? I do not know anybody in my generation who believes that we ought to just take it out on you and put our feet up when we turn 65 and turn away from the obligations we have to contribute to the further growth and vitality of people who are younger than we are. So the question is, what is the fairest way to change this? What is best for people who are on Social Security now? What is best for the baby boomers? What is best for young people in their twenties and thirties just starting to pay into the system? What is best for the kids that are in high school now who have not even started? We are going to spend a year having forums all across the country, completely nonpartisan, trying to bring people in and debate it. And then about a year from now, I am going to convene the leaders of Congress, and we are going to try to craft historic bipartisan legislation to reform Social Security, to save it for the 21st century, to make sure it is there not just for the baby boomers but for everybody in this audience and all your children, too, so we will have a system that works, so that people who work hard and do their part will know they will have elemental retirement security and that we can do it without bankrupting the country.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheuniversityillinoischampaignurbanaillinois", "title": "Remarks at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-university-illinois-champaign-urbana-illinois", "publication_date": "28-01-1998", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

And since what we do may affect how you proceed throughout your entire worklife, we have got to have people involved in their twenties, in their thirties. The young people of this country have got to be involved in this debate. It will affect you as much as anybody else. But if we do it, it will be just sort of like balancing the budget. You will never do that. We spend less money on debt; we invest more money in our future; we have a stronger economy. The same thing will be true of Social Security. Once we make the adjustments necessary to fix it, the increase in confidence, the increase in savings, the increase in belief in the future of this country as we go forward together will be absolutely astonishing. And we need you to be a part of it. The last thing I want to ask about-the Vice President touched this briefly, and he knows more about it than I do-but we need young people in this country, particularly young people in our university system, to convince the rest of America that we must and we can address the challenge of climate change and global warming. Now, I can tell you, I have been working on the economics of energy efficiencies for over 20 years now in various guises. I am convinced that the technology is out there right now to do what we need to do to do our part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in factories, in power generation systems, in homes and office buildings. And we are getting very, very close in automobiles. But listen, this is your future; this is your life; this is the world your children and your grandchildren will have to live in, in the 21st century. This is crazy for us not to do this.

{"id": 5920, "text": "I wonder if you would mind if I would communicate to you an odd thought that occurred to me, as I sat here. There was brought to me in emphatic form once, by an old soldier of mine, who reminded me that you could never tell what was around the corner in the world. When I first came back from Europe 2 years ago, and before my friends found that it was utterly futile and useless to try to make me appear better on the TV by the use of paints and stains, they had me in a little room one night, and the man was working very seriously on my face in an effort to do something about it. Finally, in this very preoccupied sort of job and atmosphere that was prevailing, he suddenly began to laugh. And he said to me, General, we have got ourselves in a funny fix. Do you know what I was in the war? He said, I was one of your paratroopers. What made me think of that this morning was the fact that when I first met Sam Sturgis, I was detailed as a young officer to coach a football team and I made him an end, and he worked pretty hard under me for some weeks and months. Today, I think that all of you would like for me to speak for you in commending him as a brilliant head of a great organization which not only here but throughout our land has built up these great works in flood control, in drainage, in water conservation, and power development-an organization of which not only the United States ENTITY but which America is proud. I am delighted to be here with you on this historic spot. Our Nation was only 16 years old when, from a point near here, two Americans of great courage--Lewis and Clark--pushed off and floated to the mouth of this great river. A little over a century ago, a man named McKay struggled over primitive paths in this area. A hundred and nine years ago., a frontiersman named McNary, with his family, reached this almost virgin land to establish his home. Both of these men had famous descendants--men who have contributed much to the extraordinary growth of the Northwest. From the McKay family came an able Governor and a dedicated Secretary of the Interior--Douglas McKay. From the McNarys came the great American whose name forevermore will distinguish this monumental work. Senator McNary believed deeply in the future of this country. He had the grit and determination to help build that future.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthededicationmcnarydamwallawallawashington", "title": "Address at the Dedication of McNary Dam, Walla Walla, Washington", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-dedication-mcnary-dam-walla-walla-washington", "publication_date": "23-09-1954", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Dwight D.

With that drive for an open river for water traffic came the natural development of hydro-electric power. Ten years ago, death denied Senator McNary the privilege of seeing his dream come true. But the will to build this dam lived after him. And may I pause to pay my personal tribute to Mrs. McNary, here with us today on the platform. That the will to build this dam survived-and that today this dam is built--are due to the spirit of distinguished citizens of this region. Especially are they due to an Oregonian who carried on Senator McNary's work and for the past 10 years has labored tirelessly to complete this project--my good friend, Senator Guy Cordon. I am mindful as well of the sustained effort of many Congressmen from this region, including particularly Congressman Hal Holmes, who have worked in behalf of this and other great projects here in the Northwest. Now, this massive dam, my friends, means much more than the steel and concrete, more than the genius and the effort that went into its building. It means more than the benefits and the progress--however great--that it will bring to this fortunate region. This structure symbolizes the purpose of using, for the benefit of all our people, the tremendous natural legacy with which the Almighty so abundantly endowed our land. Wisely and providently we must use and develop these resources, so that each succeeding generation of Americans may share in their benefits. It is for us to see that they shall not be wasted or neglected or denied to generations yet to come. Now, among these treasures of our land is water fast becoming our most valuable, most prized, most critical resource.

It is essential that every drop of water, from the moment that it falls upon our land, be turned to the service of our people. thus we will develop power, prevent floods, improve navigation, and supply our tremendous and growing domestic and industrial needs for water.

{"id": 5922, "text": "These studies, when subjected to Congressional action, will undoubtedly result in the comprehensive water policy that this country has needed since its very beginning. The wise control of our water resources obviously requires the most skillful and comprehensive planning. This dam, for example, is designed to operate in coordination with similar structures, upstream and down. It is part of a plan to assure the full use of the water resources of this entire river system. McNary Dam is, therefore, representative of the coordination that must mark the development of all of our river systems. It is, moreover, an example of national responsibility properly assumed by the Federal Government. Just a mile and a half down river is another structure--the bridge at Umatilla. I am sure that you who live here are just as proud of that bridge as you are of this tremendous dam. You have every right to be. That bridge at Umatilla is an example of local responsibility properly assumed. A major difference between the two undertakings is in size. All of you know that when construction was started on McNary Dam, no local enterprise--public or private--could have financed it, so, realizing that the dam was necessary, the Federal Government gave its support. The bridge at Umatilla was a much smaller effort. Local enterprise-in this case the county government--was able to shoulder the $5 million loan that made that construction possible. And so, local enterprise did that job. These two structures illustrate an idea we have been applying in Washington for some 19 months. A century ago Abraham Lincoln put it better than anyone else has done. He said, The legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do for themselves--in their separate and individual capacities. Now, in keeping with Lincoln's standard, the Federal Government has certain vital responsibilities in such fields relating to the control and use of water as flood control, improvement of navigation, and reclamation and development of land. When in the course of assuming these responsibilities, dams are built, then hydro-electric power is often developed, of great value to the surrounding regions and to the Nation. I hope that we shall soon have another example of Federal responsibility in the generation of power. I refer to the Libby Dam, which-like this great McNary Dam--is a project requiring the resources of the Federal Government.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthededicationmcnarydamwallawallawashington", "title": "Address at the Dedication of McNary Dam, Walla Walla, Washington", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-dedication-mcnary-dam-walla-walla-washington", "publication_date": "23-09-1954", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Dwight D.

I have recently acted to remove obstacles to the construction of that dam. A distinguished northwesterner, Governor Jordan of Idaho, has been named Chairman of the International Joint Commission. His intimate knowledge of this area and sound judgment will surely go far to speed fulfillment of our aims, and those of our Canadian neighbors. This project will be brought into existence. I shall continue to recommend Federal construction of such beneficial projects. Such activities as these, my friends, are obviously, as Lincoln said, the legitimate object of government. In all that the people can individually do for themselves, government ought not to interfere. It is not properly a Federal responsibility to try to supply all the power needs of our people. The Federal Government should no more attempt to do so than it should assume responsibility for supplying all their drinking water, their food, their housing, and their transportation. Parenthetically, may I remark that a region which lets itself become completely dependent upon national funds provided by a Congress-which Congress represents not that region alone but the whole Nation-would frequently find that the funds fail to keep pace with local needs. But the important thing is that as Federal power expands in a region-and I mean Federal authority and responsibility--local enterprise comes increasingly intimidated and discouraged, even though the needs for energy continue to grow. Such a conversion of local regions into Federal satellites poses a threat deadly to our liberties. The Administration in Washington--and the present leadership in Congress--are unalterably opposed to such malignant growth of bureaucracy. In our devotion to conservation, let us not forget that there are spiritual as well as physical values to protect. Above all else, we must protect the freedom and the spirit of independence of our people in our States and counties, in our cities and towns. Determination to have this kind of freedom gave us this Nation. It brought your ancestors to this Western country. That determination is not only the surest protector of our liberties, it is the principal ingredient in our national prosperity. Yet, there are some who contend that the development and distribution of hydro-electric power is exclusively the responsibility of the Federal Government. They argue that to permit any State or local government or any private company under governmental regulation to develop such power capacity is to give to a special group an asset belonging to all the Nation.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthededicationmcnarydamwallawallawashington", "title": "Address at the Dedication of McNary Dam, Walla Walla, Washington", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-dedication-mcnary-dam-walla-walla-washington", "publication_date": "23-09-1954", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Dwight D.

Only thus, these zealots would have us believe, can we poor citizens be protected against exploitation against what they call the predatory exponents of capitalism--that is, free enterprise. Now, let us have a quick look at this matter. In the first place it is, of course, not difficult to be generous with someone else's money. So the individual who wants to build power dams only with Federal money is not directly or particularly concerned with the economic necessity of the project or with the suitability of its location. Secondly, these advocates of centralized government shut their eyes to the remarkable development of this Nation during past decades. They must wonder how such prosperity came about when communities and citizens were free to look after themselves--including their own protection against the so-called local interests. These believers in centralization fail to warn us that monopoly is always potentially dangerous to freedom--even when monopoly is exercised by the Government. Curiously enough, they proclaim their fear of a private power monopoly in a county, city or State, but they urge upon us all a gigantic, overwhelming, nationwide power monopoly. But, of course, they also see themselves as the all-wise directors of that monopoly-so all would be well. monopoly, nor do they want a system leading toward it. They know The American people do not want and do not need to have any such they can have all the power capacity of our streams developed, as needed, without forfeiting the advantages of local responsibility and participation. Throughout our country are many public enterprises--organized years ago by States, municipalities, and other public agencies--which have long been in successful operation. In hundreds of other instances, power has been and is being provided by private enterprise under the regulatory processes in the particular governmental agency involved. In each instance the people directly concerned by such operations have themselves decided whether they are best served by public or by private agencies. The issue is not, therefore, public power versus unregulated private power. The issue posed to us is Federal monopoly of power, as against public or regulated power, freely chosen in each instance by the citizens of each area, with the Federal Government coming in as a cooperating partner where this seems necessary or desirable.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthededicationmcnarydamwallawallawashington", "title": "Address at the Dedication of McNary Dam, Walla Walla, Washington", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-dedication-mcnary-dam-walla-walla-washington", "publication_date": "23-09-1954", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Dwight D.

{"id": 5925, "text": "Last year, for example, State and local governments were invited to cooperate in power generation without the threat of Federal power control. During this brief period numerous local public agencies and private investors have applied for licenses to build hydro-electric plants. These applications in this Northwest region amount to nearly six million kilowatts. This represents a prospective investment of not less than one and one-half billion dollars. Well over half of this would be invested by public power--not private power--interests. But the seekers after Federal control of energy are not silenced even by this array of facts. They say that construction of power projects by local enterprise will impede the comprehensive development of this or other river basins. Now again--let us take a look at the facts. What they say just is not true. All power projects must be licensed by the Federal Power Commission. Before the Commission grants a license, it must see evidence that the project makes maximum use of the developed resources. It makes no difference who builds the projects-Federal, State, municipal, or private agencies. when a project is licensed before a non-Federal authority, it is not removed from public control. Rates and services remain under regulation. And when the licensing period ends, the site can be assumed by the Federal Government. that, here in the Northwest, your own public agencies and your own private companies--operating under both Federal regulation and your own eagle eyes out here--can work in the public interest at least as well as some far-off Federal agency. Through the Governors' Power Policy Committee, Governors Langlie, Patterson, Jordan, and Aronson are doing great work in assuring this area of adequate supplies of water. More benefits will flow from efforts to further inter-State cooperation on problems that cross the borders of the Northwestern States. I am especially happy that the power produced by this great new dam will contribute to the finest type of cooperative effort--your own Northwest Power Pool. This arrangement is an admirable modal of voluntary pooling of public and private generating and transmission facilities. Because of it, you citizens of the Northwest have hundreds of thousands of kilowatts of additional prime power that would not exist through independent operation of your various utilities. And in addition--and very important--you have it under your own control--not under the permission of a far-off Washington office holder.

In this effort, we shall avoid extremes. We shall neither withdraw from the power field nor will we federalize all electric power generators in the United States. Instead, we shall continue to advance in a spirit of helpfulness to localities, and in a spirit of cooperation with local citizens. Where local enterprise can shoulder the burden, it will be encouraged and supported in doing so. And where local action cannot or should not fully meet the need, we shall have Federal action. In this way, our people, in their communities and homes throughout America, shall reserve to themselves as many of the basic decisions affecting their lives as possible. In this way, our people will remain free to carve out their destinies as their predecessors did. It was in this spirit that those who preceded you in the great Northwest, in only a century and a half, turned an unsettled wilderness into an inland empire--an empire vastly enriched by this gigantic structure which today we so proudly name the McNary Dam.

We have openly and publicly addressed these and other many difficult and controversial issues--some of which had been either skirted or postponed in the past. As I pointed out in a recent press conference, a period of debate, disagreement, probing was inevitable. Our goal has not been to reach easy or transient agreements, but to find solutions that are meaningful, balanced, and lasting. Now, a president has a responsibility to present to the people of this Nation reports and summations of complex and important matters. I feel more secure as president making decisions if I know that either the most difficult, the most complex questions that face me have been understood and debated by you and understood and debated by the Congress. In the past I think our Nation's leaders have been guilty of making decisions in secret.

I would like to spell out my view of what we have done and where we are going in our relations with the Soviet Union and to reaffirm the basic principles of our national policy. I do not have any apology for talking about foreign affairs at a southern legislative conference, because foreign affairs and those difficult decisions ought never to be made with a concept that we can abandon common sense and the sound judgment and the constructive influence of the American people. For decades, the central problems of our foreign policy revolved around antagonism between two coalitions, one headed by the United States and the other headed by the Soviet Union. Our national security was often defined almost exclusively in terms of military competition with the Soviet Union. This competition is still critical, because it does involve issues which could lead to war.

As two industrial giants, we face long-term, worldwide energy crises. Whatever our political differences, both of us are compelled to begin conserving world energy and developing alternatives to oil and gas. Despite deep and continuing differences in world outlook, both of us should accept the new responsibilities imposed on us by the changing nature of international relations.

Communist parties and governments have become more widespread and more varied and, I might say, more independent from one another. Newly independent nations emerged into what has now become known as the Third World. Their role in world affairs is becoming increasingly significant. Both the United States and the Soviet Union have learned that our countries and our people, in spite of great resources, are not all-powerful. We have learned that this world, no matter how technology has shrunk distances, is nevertheless too large and too varied to come under the sway of either one or two super powers. And what is perhaps more important of all, we have, for our part, learned, all of us, this fact, these facts in a spirit not of increasing resignation, but of increasing maturity. I mention these familiar changes with which you are familiar because I think that to understand today's Soviet-American relationship, we must place it in perspective, both historically and in terms of the overall global scene.

We are working together toward a ban on chemical and biological warfare and the elimination of inventories of these destructive materials. We have proposed to curb the sales and transfers of conventional weapons to other countries, and we have asked France, Britain, and other countries to join with us in this effort. We are attempting to halt the threatening proliferation of nuclear weapons among the nations of the world which do not yet have the ability to set off nuclear explosives.

The Vladivostok negotiations of 1974 left some issues unresolved and subject to honest differences of interpretation.

If this chance to emphasize peace and cooperation instead of animosity and division is allowed to pass, it will not have been our choice. We must always combine realism with principle. Our actions must be faithful to the essential values to which our own society is dedicated, because our faith in those values is the source of our confidence that this relationship will evolve in a more constructive direction.

My hat is off to New York and its police force for their dedicated and often thankless battle against crime. And I congratulate the New York Daily News for caring enough about its community that it sponsors the New York Crime Fighters Award program. I understand that more than $60,000 in those prize moneys that Mr. Wieghart mentioned have been given out so far, and that is quite an investment in our collective peace of mind. By working together, the city and the Daily News are another example of how our public and private institutions can be made even more effective in improving the quality of our lives. But most of all, I want to thank these citizens here for-they are everyday Americans-thank them for their courage in unexpected circumstances and for their becoming heroes they were. You know, someone once said that a hero is not braver than anyone else. I do not know whether that is the answer or not, but God bless them all. And those who say we are in a time when there are no heroes, they just do not know where to look. They certainly have not been flipping through the pages of the New York Daily News lately. I wish all our people could read, as I have, the accounts of your individual acts of heroism. In each case you seem to think you acted as anyone else would have in the same situation. And you spoke from your hearts about how we all depend on one another. If somebody needs help, we should try to help out. Well, when you read how the Torres brothers chased down a purse-snatcher wielding a knife; how Mrs. Keneally, a grandmother, collared a pickpocket by his neck scarf and gave him the back of her hand until the police arrived-I liked the picture of that one more than anything- -and how Rabbi Rosenfeld immobilized a mugger armed with a machete; you realize there is nothing very average about the average American.

Eight years ago tomorrow, the Sandinista Communists came to power in the Central American country of Nicaragua. It may be hard to remember now, the great hopes with which their revolution was first greeted. The hated dictator Anastasio Somoza had been toppled, and the world looked forward to a bright future for Nicaragua. Little did we think then that the future the Sandinistas were planning for Nicaragua would be darker than anything that suffering country had ever before experienced. The Sandinistas spelled out their plans for subversion and aggression throughout Central America in the secret, but now notorious, 72-Hour Document, and it was not long before they started carrying them out. Arms shipments began flowing to the Communist guerrillas throughout Latin America-in El Salvador, Honduras, Colombia, and other countries. closing churches and extinguishing the free press . The ranks of political prisoners swelled into the thousands, and beatings, torture, and official murder became the order of the day. Meanwhile, the Sandinistas began a campaign of slaughter against the peaceful Miskito Indians. One in every ten Nicaraguans is now a refugee-leaving home, family, and friends to escape the oppression inside that country. If the Sandinistas get their way, the torment of that sad country will soon spread throughout the entire region, engulfing the young democracies that surround Nicaragua. As I said in New York a few months ago, the democratic aspirations of millions in Central America now hang in the balance. The elected leaders of neighboring Central American countries know that until democracy comes to Nicaragua their own democracies will never be safe. free, fair, and regularly scheduled elections in Nicaragua, the establishment of a genuinely democratic system and all the freedoms such a system depends on and encourages-freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of worship. This is what the Nicaraguan freedom fighters are fighting for, and this is why we must support them. We have worked in many ways to counter the spread of communism in Central America and those nations I have mentioned that are threatened by Nicaragua. We have instituted economic assistance to the region, military assistance to threatened democracies, and, together with our Central American allies, vigorous efforts to negotiate a peaceful and democratic outcome. But we know from experience that the Sandinistas will never negotiate seriously unless they see that the freedom fighters are a force to be reckoned with.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationunitedstatesassistanceforthenicaraguandemocratic2", "title": "Radio Address to the Nation on United States Assistance for the Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-nation-united-states-assistance-for-the-nicaraguan-democratic-2", "publication_date": "18-07-1987", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

From Thanksgiving to Hanukkah, which our Jewish community is now celebrating, to Christmas in 3 weeks' time, this is a season of hope and of love. Certainly one of the greatest blessings for people everywhere is the family itself. The American Family Institute recently dedicated its book of essays, The Family in the Modern World, to Maria Victoria Walesa, daughter of Danuta and Lech Walesa, to whose christening came 7,000 Poles expressing their belief that the family remains the foundation of freedom. And, of course, they are right. It is in the family where we learn to think for ourselves, care for others, and acquire the values of self-reliance, integrity, responsibility, and compassion. Families stand at the center of society, so building our future must begin by preserving family values. namely, that bigger government is the greatest force for fairness and progress. But this so-called solution has given most of us a bad case of financial indigestion. How can families survive when big government's powers to tax, inflate, and regulate absorb their wealth, usurp their rights, and crush their spirit? It now takes $85,000 to raise a child to age 18, and family incomes have not kept up. During the 1970's real wages actually declined over 2 percent. In 1948 the tax on the average two-child family was just $9. As economic and social pressures have increased, the bonds that bind families together have come under strain. For example, three times as many families are headed by single parents today as in 1960. Many single parents make heroic sacrifices and deserve all our support. But there is no question that many well-intentioned Great Society-type programs contributed to family breakups, welfare dependency, and a large increase in births out of wedlock. In the 1970's the number of single mothers rose from 8 to 13 percent among whites and from 31 to a tragic 47 percent among blacks. Too often their children grow up poor, malnourished, and lacking in motivation. It is a path to social and health problems, low school performance, unemployment, and delinquency.

Taxes have been cut for every family that earns a living, and we have increased the tax credit for child care. Yesterday we learned that our growing economy reduced unemployment to 8.2 percent last month. The payroll employment figure went up by 370,000 jobs. At the same time, new policies are helping our neediest families move from dependence to independence. Our new job training law will train over a million needy and unemployed Americans each year for productive jobs. ENTITY should add that our enterprise zones proposal would stimulate new businesses, bringing jobs and hope to some of the most destitute areas of the country. The Senate has adopted this proposal. But after 2 years of delay, the House Democratic leadership only recently agreed to hold its first hearing on the legislation. And come January, we expect action. We are moving forward on many other fronts. We have made prevention of drug abuse among youth a top priority. We will soon announce a national missing children's center to help find and rescue children who've been abducted and exploited. We are working with States and local communities to increase the adoption of special-needs children. More children with permanent homes mean fewer children with permanent problems. We are also stiffening the enforcement of child support from absent parents. And we are trying hard to improve education through more discipline, a return to the basics, and through reforms like tuition tax credits to help hard-working parents. In coming months, we will propose new ways to help families stay together, remain independent, and cope with the pressures of modern life. A cornerstone of our efforts must be assisting families to support themselves. As Franklin Roosevelt said almost 50 years ago, Self-help and self-control are the essence of the American tradition.

And when I was elected president, my major purpose in dealing with Federal Government agencies that relate to energy or to environment, to the quality of life in every way, was one of appointing people in whom I had complete confidence and, also, who had the confidence of those intensely committed environmentalists and conservationists in our country. At the same time, of course, in order for us to be effective, there must be a working relationship that cannot create insuperable barriers between those who are interested in development of jobs on the one hand, those who want to protect the quality of the outdoors, the purity of life on the other. I think that we have been successful so far, without abridging anyone's deep commitment and integrity in past statements and beliefs on the one hand, and adequate progress on the other. And I am very proud this afternoon to have a chance to introduce these men and women who will be serving in such important positions. Charles Warren is a man whom I first met when I was in Plains being briefed on the major questions concerning energy. He is a person who has been very effective in California, in the legislature, in devising and drafting and implementing major and very innovative decisions concerning the energy question, environmental questions, protection of the coastal regions, not only from a present-day point of view but as they would impact on the lives of people in years to come. And I think at some considerable sacrifice to himself, financially, but because of his interest in this subject, he is agreed to come and serve with us. And he will be the Chairman of those who will advise me on matters that relate to environmental quality. I am very glad that you have come to be with us. And I express my appreciation to you and look forward to working closely with you. Among my closest friends in the world are two people who mean a lot to me, and I think in the past and in the future will mean a lot to our country.

Doug Costle has had broad experience in this field and will be the Director of this agency, and another very close friend of mine, Barbara Blum, who helped me get many of the Georgia laws passed against formidable opposition because of her courage and tenacity and because of her knowledge of environmental questions while I was Governor of Georgia.

Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for the wonderful work that you have done in so many ways, and everything that we have done together in the last 5 1/2 years. In 1996, when the American people were good enough to give the Vice President and me another term and made me the first Democratic President in 60 years, since Franklin Roosevelt in 1936, to be reelected, we picked up some seats in the House. And if we had picked up a few more, we would have won the House. In the last 10 days, even though we had the issues and the direction, we were outspent in the 20 closest districts 4 1/2 to one. But we did begin this Unity concept a little too late, but it still did very well. All of our contributors liked it because all three committees were not asking at the same time to give money or raise it. But it was the right thing to do, because we could work on helping particular candidates, targeting particular States, going after particular constituencies, getting our turnout up. This year we are trying to go sooner and do more. And I cannot say enough for what I believe is the vision of the leaders of the House, the Senate, and the Democratic Committee for doing this early and doing it together and in good faith with a good heart. The Vice President gave that wonderful portrait of what is happened the last 6 years through chapter 6. Chapter 7 is, we win if we do the right things; if we do the right things, we win. Honor the past; imagine the future. And we started out a couple of weeks ago honoring the past by announcing grants by private citizens to help us save the Star-Spangled Banner. It is hard to think of anything that embodies our past more. And then Hillary went to Thomas Edison's* home in New Jersey to talk about saving that and then to Harriet Tubman's home, then to George Washington's revolutionary headquarters, then to New York to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the beginning of the women's movement, all honoring the past.

But since the Civil War, the party of the President in the President's second term has always lost some seats at midterm.

Nobody is smart enough to understand it all and figure out all of its ramifications. When people have the good fortune of good times, they should take their treasure and their confidence and think about tomorrow and deal with the long-term challenges of the country. There are four big issues that I think will sweep across the country this year and carry us home if our party will advance them. Number one, we waited 29 years to get out of the red. Let us do not run out and spend this surplus on a tax cut or a spending program until we save the Social Security system for the 21st century so that the baby boomers do not bankrupt their kids and their ability to raise their grandchildren when we retire. Number two, managed care, on balance, has been a good thing for America because we could not sustain inflation in health care costs at 3 times the rate of inflation in the economy. That was an unsustainable trend that developed in the 1980's. But it is just a device, and it must not be allowed to block quality care. Therefore, we should have a Patients' Bill of Rights that puts quality care back at the center of the health care debate. People should have access to the medical care they need; decisions should be made by doctors, not by accountants; people should not be turned away from emergency rooms or specialists if they need them; and their privacy should not be violated in the medical arena. That is what this Patients' Bill of Rights is all about. It is a first step toward reconciling the imperative of having better management in the health care system with keeping health care uppermost in the health care system. And a lot of you are in the health care business. One of the reasons we need legislation is, it is simply unfair to all the good people out there in health care today that are already complying with the requirements of the Patients' Bill of Rights because they think it is the morally right thing to do. It is unfair for them to be at an economic disadvantage with those who do not . So we need a Patients' Bill of Rights.

But no one believes that we still even after all this, we still cannot say that we have the best elementary and secondary education in the world for all Americans. We have an agenda for smaller classes, more teachers, more welltrained teachers, modernized schools, hooking up all the classrooms to the Internet, more after-school programs, more summer school programs for kids in difficult areas with troubled lives-things that we know work-higher standards, greater accountability, more charter schools, more school choice. We have got an agenda, and we think it ought to be supported. So we have a better schools agenda. Number four, after this summer, I take it no one seriously questions the fact that the climate is genuinely changing. The 9 hottest years on record have occurred in the last 11 years. The 5 hottest years in history have occurred in the 1990's. Last year was the hottest year on record; this year every month has been hotter than the same month last year. We still have 40 percent of our water that is not safe for swimming, in spite of all the work since the Clean Water Act passed. We still have problems with safe drinking water in some places. We still have too many toxic waste dumps in some places.

So we cannot have a stagecoach government in the era of orbiting astronauts. Government has to keep up with the times, and it has to stay ahead of the problems. I came here tonight to pledge to you good people--who are Americans first, but select the best government you know how--I came here to pledge you that as long as I lead this country we are going to keep up and catch up. But I came here to say something else. It is not the responsibility of the leaders of the Congress--some of whom are here with us this evening--alone. It cannot be done in Washington alone. It has to be the goal of every man and woman, every boy and girl. Every one of you has to pitch in and improve the corner of the country that you live in.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthejohnfkennedymemorialparklewistonmaine", "title": "Remarks at the John F.

{"id": 5946, "text": "We can pass laws to bring justice to all our people, whatever their color. We can spend money for housing, education, and training. But until we have a domestic good-neighbor policy on every block, in every city, on every roadway, there is going to be racial strife in America. We can start new programs to try to clean up the ghettoes of our cities, but until the people who live in our suburbs are color blind, there will continue to be discrimination in America. We can establish training programs for young people who need a second chance, but until law-abiding citizens give them their second chance, there is going to be delinquency in America. So if I could write just one letter to every American citizen tonight, I would make it brief, but I would try to make it directly to the point. My fellow American, democracy depends on whether you are willing to conduct yourself as if the destiny of many others were in your hands, as if the future and the character of our Nation were to be decided by what you are and by what you do. Live every day with the knowledge that America is the sum total of all the decisions that you and people like you are making this very hour. I would write that letter because I believe that what America needs more than it needs anything else right now is a strong dose of self-discipline. We need it to carry through and to support our men who are in the rice paddies of Vietnam tonight. We need it to bring racial peace and social justice to all our citizens in the United States. We need it to bring education to the mind and health to the bodies of all of our boys and girls in this country tonight. And we need it to maintain the strong economy that gives all of our people good jobs at good wages tonight. Because never forget that no matter how many harassing, frustrating problems you may have, the strong economy is the underpinning of America's material strength. Let me illustrate what I mean. People are talking a lot about inflation this election year. These same people used to talk a lot about unidentified flying objects. Where did it come from? I do not know the answers. But I do think that we should try to put the problem of inflation into perspective--and not just in terms of the early 1930's when prices were very low but few people had many dollars to buy much with.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthejohnfkennedymemorialparklewistonmaine", "title": "Remarks at the John F.

{"id": 5947, "text": "I mean the perspective that comes from looking at both sides of the prosperity coin --looking at the rising prices without forgetting the rising standard of living. We talk a lot about it these days--and we are doing a lot about it. There is want and there is some hunger--there is more of each than any of us would like to have. But I think most of you people that I am looking at here tonight in Lewiston, like most of my fellow Americans that I have seen in over 25 States, are tonight enjoying the best standard of living that you have ever known. Now it may be in the 1930's some of you were doing better. It may be in the 1940's some of you were doing better. It may be in the 1950's some of you were doing better. But I think the majority of us are doing better now than we have ever done before. They have gone up 10 percent since 1961. During that same time, though, wages have gone up, too. They have gone up not 10 percent as the prices have, but the wages have gone up 17 percent and most of you can buy more tonight than you could with your paycheck 6 years ago. In 1966 the average wage--I try to make this as understandable as I can--the average wage of a factory worker will buy twice as much in the retail stores as it would when I came to Washington in 1931. I want to repeat that because I want all of you to listen to it. In 1966, the year of our Lord tonight, the average wage of a factory worker will buy twice as much at retail as it would when I first came to Washington in 1931. You could buy more bread, and more butter, and more milk, and more molasses, and more bacon with one hour of your earnings last year than you could in 1960. And that is also true of steaks, and potatoes, and tomatoes, and liver--if you ever eat it. It is a fact that Americans are eating better food at a lower real cost than they have ever eaten before. After you get through paying your taxes--to all the Presidents and Governors and I do not know whether Senators and Congressmen think they have anything to do with it or not--but after you get through paying your taxes, your family is spending 18 percent of its income on food, 18 percent tonight, this year, compared to 26 percent of its income that it was paying 20 years ago.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthejohnfkennedymemorialparklewistonmaine", "title": "Remarks at the John F.

We have a goal, we have an objective, we have a future for America. We want to leave this world better than we found it. We have advantages that our fathers and our grandfathers did not have. And we want our children to have things that we do not have ourselves. So, prices have gone up and your standard of living has gone up, too. I hope you will keep that in perspective. You know, I think that may have been what President Franklin Roosevelt's friend meant when he saw President Roosevelt during the 1940 campaign. You remember President Roosevelt asked him how he was voting. And his friend said, Republican. Is the third term bothering you? It is just that I voted Republican the first time you ran --this fellow lived in Maine, not in Lewiston, but in Maine-- and I voted Republican the second time you ran --that was 1936, you know-- Now this is not to say that we should or we will ignore the threat that is made to our stabilization program and that comes with inflation. I want you to know that, as your President, every day that I open my office I am going to be concerned about rising prices and will try to do as much as I intelligently can about them. But I am as deeply concerned with finding the right way to deal with inflation. And that brings me back to my central point. This morning at the University of Rhode Island I said along with rights we have responsibilities. self-discipline. The ideal way to keep the economy healthy without inflation is restraint--restraint on the part of those whose decisions have a real impact on prices. And I am looking into a lot of faces of people who make decisions that can probably have more impact on prices than I can. For 2 years now I have urged business and labor in many, many conferences I have had at the White House to bargain responsibly to reach decisions that will not trigger inflation. And I am proud to report to you that many businessmen and many labor leaders have responded with restraint and with self-discipline to their President's pleas. I am sad to report to you that not all of them have, and as a result we are faced tonight with a real danger to the prosperity which you have enjoyed for 6 consecutive years.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthejohnfkennedymemorialparklewistonmaine", "title": "Remarks at the John F.

{"id": 5949, "text": "I would like for all Americans to know, those who can hear it and those who can read, unless there is restraint now, unless there is voluntary self-discipline by management and labor, then your Government will be compelled by sheer necessity to act in order to protect all of the people. For in a democracy, the interest of all the people is, and should be, always overriding. And it is Government's duty and it is your president's duty, and he will exercise that duty by trying to reason-- come reason together --to protect that interest. But if, after we reason and after we appeal for self-discipline, after we ask for restraint, there are still general excesses, then I pledge you tonight we are going to protect your interests. Now that sums up about all I have to say on the inflation problem. This will end my speaking for this week--at least this Saturday. I have told you the general subjects we have discussed. I just want to conclude by talking about one that we have not discussed. We have been talking about problems. But I want to talk about successes. I want to talk about the day in America when we have 76 million people working, working full 40-hour weeks, some of them drawing good overtime, working at an average factory wage in excess of $112 per week-the highest in the history of this Nation-more people working, getting more pay, than at any time in the history of this Nation. We have the best education and health programs that any government has ever inaugurated. Our citizens are eating more. They are wearing more. Their children are going to better schools. They are driving better automobiles and more of them--some people even have two. They are living in better homes, although all of them do not have good homes. And except for our problems in Vietnam, we have so much to be thankful for. So when you go home tonight after having listened to those whose principal job all day has been complaining, to those who got up on the wrong side of the bed and have been martyrs all day long, feeling that nobody loved them and they had been mistreated, just think about what other country you would like to trade your citizenship in for.

I think the average American does not ask much, does not expect much, does not have to have much. He wants a church where he can worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. He wants a home where he and his wife can raise their family in comfort. He wants a job where he can earn enough to meet his responsibilities as a parent. He wants to be able to provide health care for his growing family and security for his old age. And he may want to go to a park or a seashore once in a while, or even a movie, or to sit and listen to television. But outside of that, that is about all he asks for. And most of us have that and we ought to be thankful for it. So if I could leave one thought with you, finally. I have gotten great strength from visiting with you and looking into your faces and giving you my views. I have learned something from you, too, you people in the five States that I have visited. I can go back and listen to the complainers-if there be any in Washington--the commentators, I can hear their individual viewpoints. But I will have enough strength to make my judgments and my decisions, because every man that is ever been President of the United States wants to make the right decision. Their great problem is knowing what is right because most of the decisions that come to a President are balanced just like this. The easy ones are settled by the Congressmen, the Senators, and Governors. Last week or the week before, when we settled the airlines strike the first time, before the machinists had had their vote on it and had a chance to express themselves, I picked up some of the leading journals of this country which really have a good deal of information on a good many subjects. One of the editorials said that I was a dictator, and I had arrogance of power, and I twisted arms, and I had brought about an agreement. That made me sad, because I do not like for people to say ugly things about me and I do not want to be a dictator.

I do not want to be a dictator; I do want to have some leadership. Now how do I go about it? He said it reminded him of the story about the fellow and the donkey. He said, A man was walking along with a donkey. Someone said, 'Why would a man want to lead a donkey? Why does not he ride it?' Said he got on the donkey and the little boy he had with him was walking along beside him. Someone said, 'Why did that old, big man get on a donkey and let that little boy walk?' So the fellow said, 'OK,' and put the little boy on the donkey. As they went on down the road a little bit, one of these complainers saw the little donkey coming along with the man and the boy both on it and they said, 'Why do those two big men ride that poor little donkey?' Why do not - they carry the donkey?' Now dissent, different viewpoints, different objectives are the strength of America. We do not all see everything alike or we would all belong to the same church, we would all wear the same clothes, we would all drive the same automobile, and we would all want the Same Wife. It is this difference and this right to express it that makes this the most powerful, the most wealthy, the most stable nation in all the world.

{"id": 5952, "text": "Prime Minister, today we accomplished a great deal. Tonight we celebrate the ties that bind us. Those ties begin with the discoveries of Columbus and Vespucci, whose busts adorn the Blue Room next door. When the Founders created the American Republic, they looked to Rome for inspiration. George Washington was likened to Cincinnatus, the Roman hero who abandoned his plow to rescue his country by popular demand. I might say, they were the last two people to head our countries only by popular demand. Poets and philosophers of the Roman Republic were read and rejuvenated as our new Republic looked to the past to plan our future. In the writings of ancient Roman thinkers like Cicero and Cato, America's Founders saw the promise of democratic representative government. from our architecture to words like senate and capitol. Indeed, after our Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin was asked what our Founders had produced. His simple reply was, A Republic, sir, if you can keep it. Towns sprang up with the names from the ancient Mediterranean world, names like Utica, Troy, or the Vice President's hometown, Carthage. Artists portrayed America's leaders wearing togas, as the bust of George Washington in the hall demonstrates. Thankfully, that is a tradition we have left to the 19th century. In the 19th and 20th centuries, our Republic turned into a bustling nation, thanks in no small measure to Italian-Americans. Ancient Rome was replaced by young Italy in the American imagination. And democracy was given new life by heroes like Mazzini and Garibaldi. America's growing cities attracted millions of Italians, eager to build a new life in a new world. Today American Italians, or Italian-Americans, are leaders in every enterprise conducted in our Nation. And as we all know, it is impossible to walk more than a few blocks in any American city without hearing the words caffe latte. The people here in this room tonight are the link between our two countries, between two cultures that have nourished each other since America was just an idea. From our highest courts to our finest tables, from our playing fields to our silver screen, from one side of the aisle in Congress to the other, Italian-Americans have graced our Nation with their intellect, their industry, their good will, and above all, a contagious love of life.

{"id": 5953, "text": "I will speak about them in a few moments. Lee Iacocca, chairman of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, honored guests, and ladies and gentlemen, on this date in 1886, President Grover Cleveland stood on an island in New York Harbor to dedicate a statue entitled Liberty Enlightening the World. Ninety-nine years later, the statue is known by a more familiar affectionate name, the Statue of Liberty or simply Miss Liberty. She is cherished across America, and the torch that she bears is recognized throughout the world as a symbol of human freedom. The Statue of Liberty was conceived and created by the French sculptor Frederic Bartholdi. Legend has it that as he worked, he modeled the statue's face-that face of utter calm and nobility-on the features of his own mother. Completed, the statue rose more than 150 feet and was constructed of 200,000 pounds of hand-hammered copper sheathing hung on an iron frame engineered by Gustav Eiffel, who later designed the Eiffel Tower. On July 4th, 1884, the statue was presented to the American Ambassador to France. Built using funds donated by the French people, she was then dismantled and shipped to the United States. Then, she was rebuilt using funds donated by the American people, including money raised by schoolchildren. Ever since, she is stood on her island in that great harbor lighting the way to freedom. Between 1892 and 1954, nearly 17 million immigrants to the New World passed through the Ellis Island checkpoint. Most immigrants moved through the checkpoint in a few hours to begin their new lives in America and freedom. And I like to picture the scene as a boatload of immigrants leaving Ellis Island for New York, they pass Miss Liberty and crowd the rails to gaze. Someone on board knows English, he reads and translates the inscription that the statue bears, words that have proclaimed the meaning of America for millions of immigrants, for shiploads of returning soldiers in two great wars, for every family that has ever visited that glorious statue. I lift my lamp beside the Golden Door. Well, many of those immigrants remain at the rails until Miss Liberty is lost in the fog. It would be no surprise if some shed tears of joy. In recent years, it became all too apparent that Ellis Island and Miss Liberty, herself, were being ravaged by the passing of decades.

{"id": 5954, "text": "But that island, which should be a proud memorial to our forbearers, had instead become a sad and ramshackled place. Miss Liberty, for her part, had been badly corroded by decades of salt air; her iron supports had weakened; in places, she'd become pocked with jagged, rusty holes. Well, then, in 1982 the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation was formed to restore Miss Liberty and rebuild Ellis Island, and to do so with private funds. This effort has become one of the largest private sector initiatives in American history. Across America, everyone is lending a hand; major corporations are making contributions; small businesses are helping out. And I am pleased to say that just as schoolchildren helped raise the money to build her pedestal and install Miss Liberty back in the 1880's, today, a century later, they are holding bake sales and car washes to see to it that she gets the restoration she needs. Let me give you just three of many stirring examples. Michael Haverly, of Indianapolis, Indiana, has raised over $5,000 for the statue by going door to door with an appeal to help Miss Liberty. Well, I am proud to be in Michael's company here in the Rose Garden today. And then, there is Amy Nessler, of West Deptford Township, New Jersey, who brought a jar of 365 pennies into her first-grade class to help raise money for the Statue of Liberty. The pennies had been collected 15 years earlier by Amy's mother, who, day by day, put one into a jar to mark the time that her fianc was in Vietnam. And now, after all these years, they felt it was only appropriate to give these special coins to Lady Liberty, who symbolizes what Amy's dad fought for freedom. Well, I am very happy that Amy, her mother, and father are here with us today. When Donna's hometown learned that she was losing her sight to an incurable eye disease, they pitched in to raise money to send her and her family to visit the Statue of Liberty. However, Donna, in the spirit of generosity, donated part of this contribution to the Liberty Restoration Project. And, Donna, you are a fine example to us all.

{"id": 5955, "text": "Today, as part of an international coalition of some 60 nations, including Arab countries, our men and women in uniform continue the fight against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. More than 2,000 coalition airstrikes have pounded these terrorists. We are disrupting their command and control and supply lines, making it harder for them to move. We are destroying their fighting positions, their tanks, their vehicles, their barracks, their training camps, and the oil and gas facilities and infrastructure that fund their operations. We are taking out their commanders, their fighters, and their leaders. In Iraq, local forces have largely held the line and, in some places, have pushed ISIL back. In Syria, ISIL failed in its major push to take the town of Kobani, losing countless fighters in the process, fighters who will never again threaten innocent civilians. And we have seen reports of sinking morale among ISIL fighters as they realize the futility of their cause. Now, make no mistake, this is a difficult mission, and it will remain difficult for some time. It is going to take time to dislodge these terrorists, especially from urban areas. But our coalition is on the offensive, ISIL is on the defensive, and ISIL is going to lose. Its barbaric murders of so many people, including American hostages, are a desperate and revolting attempt to strike fear in the hearts of people it can never possibly win over by its ideas or its ideology, because it offers nothing but misery and death and destruction. With our allies and partners, we are going to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. And when I announced our strategy against ISIL in September, I said that we are strongest as a nation when the President and Congress work together. Today my administration submitted a draft resolution to Congress to authorize the use of force against ISIL. I want to be very clear about what it does and what it does not do. This resolution reflects our core objective to destroy ISIL. a systemic and sustained campaign of airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria; support and training for local forces on the ground, including the moderate Syrian opposition; preventing ISIL attacks in the region and beyond, including by foreign terrorist fighters who try to threaten our countries; regional and international support for an inclusive Iraqi Government that unites the Iraqi people and strengthens Iraqi forces against ISIL; humanitarian assistance for the innocent civilians of Iraq and Syria, who are suffering so terribly under ISIL's reign of horror .", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksproposedlegislationsubmittedthecongressauthorizetheusemilitaryforce", "title": "Remarks on Proposed Legislation Submitted to the Congress To Authorize the Use of Military Force Against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-proposed-legislation-submitted-the-congress-authorize-the-use-military-force", "publication_date": "11-02-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Even as we meet this challenge in Iraq and Syria, we all agree that one of our weapons against terrorists like ISIL-a critical part of our strategy-is the values we live here at home. One of the best antidotes to the hateful ideologies that try to recruit and radicalize people to violent extremism is our own example as diverse and tolerant societies that welcome the contributions of all people, including people of all faiths. The resolution we have submitted today does not call for the deployment of U.S. ground combat forces to Iraq or Syria. It is not the authorization of another ground war, like Afghanistan or Iraq. The 2,600 American troops in Iraq today largely serve on bases, and yes, they face the risks that come with service in any dangerous environment. But they do not have a combat mission. They are focused on training Iraqi forces, including Kurdish forces. As I have said before, I am convinced that the United States should not get dragged back into another prolonged ground war in the Middle East. That is not in our national security interest, and it is not necessary for us to defeat ISIL. Local forces on the ground who know their countries best are best positioned to take the ground fight to ISIL, and that is what they are doing. At the same time, this resolution strikes the necessary balance by giving us the flexibility we need for unforeseen circumstances. For example, if we had actionable intelligence about a gathering of ISIL leaders, and our partners did not have the capacity to get them, I would be prepared to order our Special Forces to take action, because I will not allow these terrorists to have a safe haven. So we need flexibility, but we also have to be careful and deliberate. As Commander in Chief, I will only send our troops into harm's way when it is absolutely necessary for our national security. Finally, this resolution repeals the 2002 authorization of force for the invasion of Iraq and limits this new authorization to 3 years. I do not believe America's interests are served by endless war or by remaining on a perpetual war footing. As a nation, we need to ask the difficult and necessary questions about when, why, and how we use military force.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksproposedlegislationsubmittedthecongressauthorizetheusemilitaryforce", "title": "Remarks on Proposed Legislation Submitted to the Congress To Authorize the Use of Military Force Against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-proposed-legislation-submitted-the-congress-authorize-the-use-military-force", "publication_date": "11-02-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

To those who lived through World War II and those who grew up in the years that followed, few memories inspire more awe and horror than the battle for Okinawa. In the greatest conflict the world has ever known, our forces fought no engagement more bitter or more bloody. In 82 days of fighting, America suffered more than 12,000 dead in this final epic battle, the most costly one during the entire Pacific war. At the very heart of this crucible was the fight for a hill called Sugar Loaf, the key to breaking the enemy's line across the south of the island, some of the grimmest combat our forces had ever seen. The marines on Sugar Loaf faced a hail of artillery, mortars, and grenades. They were raked by constant machinegun fire. Time and again, our men would claw their way uphill only to be repulsed by the enemy. Progress was measured by the yard. On May 14th, 1945, a 19-year-old corporal named Jim Day led several other marines to a shell crater on the slope of Sugar Loaf. What happened then surpasses our powers of imagination. On the first day in that isolated hole, Corporal Day and those with him fought off an advance by scores of enemy soldiers. That night he helped to repel three more assaults, as those with him fell dead or injured. Braving heavy fire, he escorted four wounded comrades, one by one, to safety. But he would not stay in safety. Instead, he returned to his position to continue the fight. As one of his fellow marines later reported, the corporal was everywhere.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkspresentingthecongressionalmedalhonormajorgeneraljamesldayusmcretired", "title": "Remarks on Presenting the Congressional Medal of Honor to Major General James L.

{"id": 5958, "text": "He would run from one spot to another trying to get more fire on the enemy. When the next day broke, Corporal Day kept on fighting, alone but for one wounded fellow marine. Through assault after assault and into his second night, he fought on. Burned by white phosphorus and wounded by shrapnel, he continued to fire his weapon and hold his ground. He hauled ammunition from a disabled vehicle back to his shellhole and fought and fought, one assault after another, one day, then the next. The battle on Sugar Loaf decimated two Marine regiments. But when Corporal Jim Day was finally relieved after 3 days of continuous fighting, virtually alone, he had stood his ground. And the enemy dead around his foxhole numbered more than 100. His heroism played a crucial part in America's victory at Sugar Loaf. And that success opened the way to the capture of Okinawa and the ultimate triumph of the forces of freedom in the Pacific. Now, for this extraordinary valor, we recognize James L. Day as one of the bravest of the brave. In words that echo from the peaks of American military history, he has distinguished himself, at the risk of his life, above and beyond the call of duty. As Commander in Chief, I am proud to award General Day our Nation's highest military honor, the Medal of Honor. the name Jim Day belongs in the rolls of the Corps' greatest heroes, alongside Dan Daly, Smedley Butler, Joe Foss, and John Basilone. General, your achievements leave us all in awe. In particular, it is hard to know whether we should be conferring on you a Medal of Honor for bravery or for modesty. Let me tell you the story of how we happen to be here today, over 50 years later. Although the battle for Okinawa was still raging when his battlefield commanders nominated young Corporal Day for this decoration, so many died in the fighting and so many reports were lost in the battle, the paperwork simply never went forward in 1945. General Day later said that awards were not on their minds in those days. As he put it, We just had a job to do, and we wanted to get the job done. Years later, when veterans of Sugar Loaf wanted to restart the process, Jim Day forbade them from doing so. Then a general, he felt that seeking such an honor would set a bad example for those he commanded.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkspresentingthecongressionalmedalhonormajorgeneraljamesldayusmcretired", "title": "Remarks on Presenting the Congressional Medal of Honor to Major General James L.

It is wonderful to be here at Applied Materials. I want to thank Mike and everybody who helped out hosting us and a wonderful tour of the facility. Rick was showing me some of your clean rooms where you are building the equipment that makes the chips that is basically powering that is basically powering everything that you guys are taking pictures with right now. now, this is just magic. I do not know how they do it. Somebody was explaining to me that I guess one of the wafers was being cleaned, and he said, this would be the equivalent it was Alex who told me this; Alex is around here somewhere-the equivalent of, if you were mowing the South Lawn, but every blade of grass was exactly cut at the same height within a single human hair. That sounds pretty precise to me. And if that is , by the way, the precision that you operate on, if that is how you define a clean room, then Sasha and Malia are going to have to step up their game at home. I want to thank your Mayor, Lee Leffingwell, and-who is doing a great job. Lee is doing outstanding work every day and helping to bring the Austin community together. The Mayor of San Antonio in the house, my friend Julian Castro is here. a thriving, rising middle class and a dynamic, cutting-edge economy. And I see three things that we need to focus on to do it. Number one, we have got to make America a magnet for good jobs. Number two, we have got to help people earn the skills they need to do those jobs. Number three, we have got to make sure people's hard work is rewarded so that they can make a decent living doing those jobs. And if you watch the news sometimes, you may think that there is just doom and gloom out there. But the truth is, there is incredible stuff going on all across America and right here in Austin that I think can be good models for the rest of America to follow. This morning I visited Manor New Tech High School where students are learning high-tech skills that companies like Applied are looking for right now. They are getting excited, working with math and science and technology and engineering. And it is a hands-on high school, where subjects are integrated and kids are building things and conducting experiments at very early ages.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksappliedmaterialsincaustintexas", "title": "Remarks at Applied Materials, Inc., in Austin, Texas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-applied-materials-inc-austin-texas", "publication_date": "09-05-2013", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And then I joined a few local families for lunch to talk about how we can make sure that hard work pays off with wages you can live on and raise a family, with health care that you can count on and the chance to put away some money for retirement. And we also had good barbecue which is necessary for economic growth. And then I came to Applied Materials to talk about what we can do to make America a magnet for new jobs in manufacturing. And after shedding jobs for a decade, our manufacturers have added now about 500,000 new manufacturing jobs over the past 3 years. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan, and Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. And after placing plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home. This year, Apple started making Macs in America again. So there are some good trend lines there, but we have got to do everything we can to strengthen that trend. We have got to do everything we can to help the kind of high-tech manufacturing that you are doing right here at Applied. And we want to make sure it takes root here in Austin and all across the country. And that means, first of all, creating more centers of high-tech manufacturing. Last year, we launched our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio, to develop new technologies and equip workers with the skills required to master 3-D printing techniques. And in my State of the Union Address, I called on Congress to set up 15 more of these manufacturing hubs all across America, and I said that my administration was going to go ahead and move forward with three new hubs on our own, even without congressional action. Well, today we are launching a competition for those hubs. We are looking for businesses and universities that are willing to partner together to help their region help turn their region into global centers of high-tech jobs. Because we want the next revolution in manufacturing to be made in America. We are going to do that. The truth is, over the past couple decades, too many communities have been hit hard when plants closed down and jobs dried up. Nobody knows that better than folks here at Applied.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksappliedmaterialsincaustintexas", "title": "Remarks at Applied Materials, Inc., in Austin, Texas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-applied-materials-inc-austin-texas", "publication_date": "09-05-2013", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And even as we are working to reverse the trend of communities that have been hard hit with old manufacturing leaving, we have got to propose partnerships with local leaders in manufacturing communities to help attract new investment in the infrastructure and the research that will attract new jobs and new businesses so that communities that have been knocked down can get back up and get back on their feet. And we should help our workers get the training they need to compete for the industries of tomorrow. No job in America should go unfilled just because we do not have anybody with the right skills. Now, some of your colleagues that I met, some of them have advanced degrees. Some of them came to apply basically right out of high school. But all of you, whether it was in some cases through a university education, in some cases the military, in some cases just on-the-job training, all of you have specialized skills that are exactly what we need to continue to grow our economy. But we have got a whole bunch of folks out there who do not have those skills, either because the education system failed them or because their skills have been rendered obsolete. I want to make sure that we are training 2 million Americans at our community colleges for skills that will lead directly to a job. We and that is also why we have got to make sure that college is affordable and people are not burdened by a mountain of debt so that they can continue to upgrade their skills as well. Now, if we want to manufacture the best products, we have also got to invest in and cultivate the best ideas. Innovation, ingenuity, that is the constant of the American economy. That is one of the constants of our character. It is what keeps America on the cutting edge. And just before I came here, I visited the Capital Factory, which, as some of you know, is a place that helps startups take off. And everywhere you turn, somebody has got a new idea. They are taking risks.

And what currently costs about $80,000, costs about $3,000 the technology that he is developed. So they are doing amazing stuff. And one of the things we are doing to fuel more inventiveness like this to fuel more private sector innovation and discoveryis to make the vast amounts of America's data open and easy to access for the first time in history So talented entrepreneurs are doing some pretty amazing stuff with data that is already being collected by Government. So over at the Capital Factory, I met with folks behind the startup called Stormpulse, which uses Government data on weather to help businesses anticipate disruptions in service. And then you have got a Virginia company called Opower, that is used Government data on trends in energy use to save its customers $200 million on their energy bills. There is an app called iTriage, founded by a pair of ER doctors that uses data from the Department of Health and Human Services to help users understand medical symptoms and find local doctors and health care providers. And that is going to help launch more startups. It is going to help launch more businesses. Some of them undoubtedly will be using this data powered by chips that essentially started right here at Applied Materials. It is going to help more entrepreneurs come up with products and services that we have not even imagined yet. This kind of innovation and ingenuity has the potential to transform the way we do almost everything. One-third of jobs in Austin are now supported by the tech sector. And we should do all that we can to encourage this kind of innovation economy all across America, in ways that produce new jobs and new opportunities for the middle class. And we are poised for a time of progress if we are willing to seize it. Not even 5 years after the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes, our jobs market and our housing market are steadily healing. Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in decades.

So Mike and I were talking about the fact that if we can reform our tax system to eliminate some of these loopholes, potentially, we could lower some rates. Basic research, you will hear people talk about how government is not going to do anything for us. Well, we all understand that the private sector powers and drives our economy. On the other hand, most of the private sector right now has a lot of trouble financing basic research. And that basic research is the foundation for everything that is done at this company, and everything that is done for most of your customers. And we cannot afford to fall behind when it comes to basic research. So there is some key things that we can do that should not be ideological. They are not Democratic ideas or Republican ideas or Independent ideas, they are just good ideas that allow the government to help create the foundation, the platform, the environment in which companies like Applied Materials can thrive. And that is what we have got to constantly champion. And when you are talking to your Members of Congress or you are talking to elected officials, you have got to remind them we do not want government to do everything for us, but it is got a role to play on infrastructure, basic research, making sure that we have got a fair a tax system that is fair, making sure that we have got some basic stability in our budget so people are not always guessing what is going to happen around the corner. Back in 1967, when Applied Materials was just getting off the ground, there were five employees. They worked out of this small industrial unit in California. And I suppose they had a clean room in there, but I do not know what it looked like. But what they lacked in size, they made up with ingenuity and imagination and risk-taking. And over the years, as you grew to become a leader in high-tech manufacturing, that ingenuity never faltered. Whether you have been with this company for decades as I know some of you have or just for a year, you are all focused on the future.

I have endeavored to place these problems before the people as I see them from the facts and experience that have come to me in these past years. I wished the people to realize more intimately the difficulties with which their Government has been confronted, the disasters which have been averted, and the forces which have been mobilized for their support and their protection. I hope from these discussions that the people will realize the great crisis that we have successfully passed and the unprecedented measures taken which have been designed solely that we might protect and restore the system of life and of government endeared to us over 150 years--a government that has given to us protection from distress and allayed the forces which would otherwise have wrecked our homes and our firesides. But more than that, I hope I have given an understanding of these measures that have been designed for counterattack upon this crisis. These measures are now demonstrating their strength and effectiveness not only at home but abroad, evidences of which are multiplying throughout the country in the return of more than half a million men to work monthly, and that we have again resumed the road toward prosperity. I might add that the figure which I have given during the last few days of the return of 1 million men to work since the adjournment of the Congress have been added to during the day today by the estimates of the American Federation of Labor which increased the estimates, which I have given to you, by nearly 300,000 men.

The ballot is that most sacred individual act which preserves the great system of self-government which we have inherited and which should carry forward at any cost. It is a direct opportunity for every man and woman to express their views in terms of equality with every other citizen as to the policies and kind of a government that they wish carried out in the next 4 years.

We differ strongly as to the method to progress. I differ widely with the principles and views advocated by our opponents, but it is not my purpose to review them at this moment.

The ultimate goal of our progress is to build for security and happiness in these homes where the inspiration of our religious faiths will implant in our children those principles of social order and idealism, and where our Government will contribute in safeguarding their future opportunity for them. The action of our Nation has been modified and benefited by the enfranchisement of women. They equally with the men bear the shocks from economic disaster. With them lies largely the guardianship of the fundamental ideals, because concentrated in their lives and their responsibilities is a solicitude for the preservation of the home and the inspiration for the future. And in these labors our Government can contribute to strengthen their accomplishment and their influence. Our women give with lavish hands, not only to childhood, but, as well, to the creation of those conserving customs upon which are builded all the blessings of our ordered Government. They thus give to government a large measure of the true strength of its foundations. It is but just that they receive back, in return, all that the Government can give them to assure them of security and the enlargement of the equal opportunity to their children and to themselves, to widen the field for the use of their own powers of mind and spirit.

We must have as our representatives in this task the ablest men and women America can pro-duce, and the structure they join in building must rest upon the solid rock of a united American public opinion. I am not one of those who despair of achieving that end. I am utterly confident we can do it. For years, we have had men in Washington who were notoriously weak in certain branches of arithmetic but they specialized in division. They have been playing up minor differences of opinion among our people until the people of other countries might have thought that America was cleft in two. Recently the overwhelming majesty of that broad area of agreement has become obvious. The Republican Party can take pride in helping to define it and broaden it. There are only a few, a very few, who really believe that America should try to remain aloof from the world. There are only a relatively few who believe it would be practical for America or her allies to renounce all sovereignty and join a Super-state. I certainly would not deny these two extremes the right to their opinions; but I stand firmly with the overwhelming majority of my fellow citizens in that great wide area of agreement. That agreement was clearly expressed by the Republican Mackinac Declaration and was adopted in the foreign policy plank of this Convention. No organization for peace will last if it is slipped through by stealth or trickery or the momentary hypnotism of high-sounding phrases.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressacceptingthepresidentialnominationtherepublicannationalconventionchicago1", "title": "Address Accepting the Presidential Nomination at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-accepting-the-presidential-nomination-the-republican-national-convention-chicago-1", "publication_date": "28-06-1944", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Thomas Dewey"], "gender": ["M"]}}

That is not too much to ask in the name of those who have died for the future of our country. This is no task for men who specialize in dividing our people. It is no task to be entrusted to stubborn men, grown old and tired and quarrelsome in office. We learned that in 1919. The building of the peace is more than a matter of international co-operation. God has endowed America with such blessings as to fit her for a great role in the world. We can only play that role if we are strong and healthy and vigorous as nature has equipped us to be. It would be a tragedy if after this war Americans returned from our armed forces and failed to find the freedom and opportunity for which they fought. This must be a land where every man and woman has a fair chance to work and get ahead. Never again must free Americans face the spectre of long-continued, mass unemployment. We Republicans are agreed that full employment shall be a first objective of national policy. And by full employment I mean a real chance for every man and woman to earn a decent living. What hope does the present administration offer here? In 1940, the year before this country entered the war, there were still 10,000,000 unemployed. After seven years of unequalled power and unparalleled spending, the New Deal had failed utterly to solve that problem. It never solved that problem. It was left to be solved by war. Do we have to have a war to get jobs? What are we now offered? Only the dreary prospect of a continued war economy after the war, with interference piled on interference and petty tyrannies rivaling the very regimentation against which we are now at war. The present administration has never solved this fundamental problem of jobs and opportunity. It can never solve this problem. It has never even understood what makes a job. It has never been for full production. It has lived in chattering fear of abundance. It has specialized in curtailment and restriction. It has been consistently hostile to and abusive of American business and American industry, although it is in business and industry that most of us make our living. In all the record of the past 11 years is there anything that suggests the present administration can bring about high-level employment after this war? Is there any reason to believe that those who have so signally failed in the past can succeed in the future?", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressacceptingthepresidentialnominationtherepublicannationalconventionchicago1", "title": "Address Accepting the Presidential Nomination at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-accepting-the-presidential-nomination-the-republican-national-convention-chicago-1", "publication_date": "28-06-1944", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Thomas Dewey"], "gender": ["M"]}}

For one hundred and fifty years America was the hope of the world. Here on this great broad continent we had brought into being something for which men had longed throughout all history. Here, government derived its just powers from the consent of the governed. Here men believed passionately in freedom, independence-the God-given right of the individual to be his own master. Yet, with all of this freedom-I insist-because of this freedom-ours was a land of plenty. In a fashion unequalled anywhere else in the world, America grew and strengthened; our standard of living became the envy of the world. In all lands, men and women looked toward America as the pattern of what they, themselves, desired. And because we were what we were, good will flowed toward us from all corners of the earth. An American was welcomed everywhere and looked upon with admiration and regard. At times, we had our troubles; made our share of mistakes; but we faltered only to go forward with renewed vigor. It remained for the past eleven years, under the present national administration, for continuing unemployment to be accepted with resignation as the inevitable condition of a nation past its prime. It is the New Deal which tells us that America has lost its capacity to grow. We shall never build a better world by listening to those counsels of defeat. Is America old and worn out as the New Dealers tell us? Look to the reaches of the wide Pacific-to the corners of the world where American men are fighting. our country is just fighting its way through to new horizons. The future of America has no limit. True, we now pass through dark and troubled times, scarcely a home escapes the touch of dread anxiety and grief; yet in this hour the American spirit rises, faith returns-faith in our God, faith in our fellowman, faith in the land our fathers died to win, faith in the future, limitless and bright, of this, our country.

I admire teachers and like teachers so much, I married one. Laura is a great advocate for literacy and a strong supporter for America's teachers, and I am really proud to have her by my side during these unbelievable times and this great experience of serving our country-other than being a fine introducer. The thing I like about teaching is, teaching is such an optimistic profession. I know when teachers look out at their classrooms, you see more than a child at play or at study. You are able to see a child with big dreams and big hopes. You see future doctors and scientists and entrepreneurs and inventors, and I hope you see even a teacher or two. You dedicated your lives to the formation of young minds. You are giving our children the skills they need to succeed in life and equally important, the courage and the drive to realize those dreams. Our Nation is grateful for your hard work. We appreciate what you do, and we are honored you are here at the White House. I want to thank our Secretary of Education, Margaret Spellings. She believes strongly in the classroom teacher, and she believes in the potential of every child. I am pleased to recognize Senator Sam Brownback, for the State of Kansas. I am glad you are here-and his wife, Mary; thank you for coming. thank you all for taking time to honor the teachers who are here. Sam Bennett from Florida- say hello to the Governor-Ron Poplau of Kansas-no wonder you all are here-and Susan Barnard of Washington State. Everybody here has been introduced to Kim Oliver, but you have not met her parents, Vincent and Veronica. I want to thank all the Teachers of the Year from around our country who are here.

It is a job that requires compassion and determination and extraordinary patience. And as Laura hinted, or maybe did not hint, I was probably one of those kind that tested your patience. You are helping young people to learn the basics of reading and writing and adding and subtracting. You are serving as mentors and, probably most importantly, as role models. You help kindle young imaginations, and you inspire a love of learning. It is a pretty significant job description, when you think about it. And the teachers we honor here today are excelling at that job. Your daily efforts help young Americans grow into successful adults. In other words, you are building the future for the country. We ask a lot of our teachers, and we owe you a lot in return. And when I first came to office, I worked with members of both political parties-believe it or not, it is possible here in Washington to occasionally do that-to increase funding from the Federal level but also to pass the No Child Left Behind Act. The spirit of the No Child Left Behind Act basically says, society has a deep obligation to challenge the soft bigotry of low expectations, that we believe every child can learn, and therefore, we believe it makes sense to determine whether or not every child is learning. And if not, there ought to be extra help so that no child in our society is left behind. We are beginning to see good results, thanks to our Nation's teachers. The 2005 Nation's Report Card showed America's fourth graders are posting the best scores in reading and math in the history of the test. African American and Hispanic fourth graders set records in reading and math last year. America's eighth graders earned the best math scores ever recorded. Eighth grade Hispanic and African American students achieved their highest math scores ever. We are making really important strides toward closing an achievement gap in America, and I want to thank our teachers for your hard work. I have recently launched the American Competitiveness Initiative, which will help our students do better in math and science.

If we ensure that America's children have the skills they need to succeed in life, we will make sure America succeeds in the world. Improving the quality of education for young Americans requires good laws and good policies, but ultimately it depends on good teachers. And that is why we are here on the South Lawn, to honor really good teachers. The Teacher of the Year, Kim Oliver, teaches kindergarten at Broad Acres Elementary School in Silver Spring, Maryland. Broad Acres is Montgomery County's highest poverty school, a place where 90 percent of the children qualify for federally-subsidized meals and about 75 percent have parents who do not speak English at home. It is a school filled with the kind of students that inspired Kim Oliver to become a teacher. Kim decided to become a teacher at a young age. It is really interesting for teachers to hear what she said. She said, As a young child, I loved and admired my day care teacher, Mrs. Chandler. I wanted to be just like her. Chandler made me feel special, as if I were the only child in her class. Kim Oliver had many friends growing up who came from unstable and impoverished homes. She says, I watched so many of my friends live up to the low expectations that were set for them. To this day, I find myself wondering, what if my disadvantaged friends had 12 years worth of Mrs. Chandlers in their lives? Kim went on to say, I chose to become a teacher to motivate and inspire the neediest students, who many have written off, and let them know they can achieve and succeed in life regardless of what the statistics may show. I love that attitude. I think you are beginning to get the drift of why she is the Teacher of the Year. When Kim Oliver arrived at Broad Acres in 2000, the school was threatened with forced restructuring by the State as a result of poor academic performance. Oliver took a leadership role at the school. That is what good teachers do; they take the lead. She became a teacher-leader and helped lead a collaborative effort to improve the curriculum, instruction, and assessment. She helped establish instructional planning sessions and formal procedures to examine student work and improve student performance.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkshonoringthe2006nationalandstateteacherstheyear", "title": "Remarks Honoring the 2006 National and State Teachers of the Year", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-honoring-the-2006-national-and-state-teachers-the-year", "publication_date": "26-04-2006", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

And so she and her colleagues purchased cassette players and recorded books on tape for the students to take home and share with their families, which made it a lot easier for parents who struggle with English to help their children. Kim Oliver also organized a regular Books and Supper Night, where families could check out books from the library and read together before sharing a dinner, which fostered learning and family involvement in their children's education. If you can get the parents involved in the child's education, you have a much better chance of succeeding. She set high expectations. Good teachers set high expectations. She provided needed assistance. She involved families, and she helped turn that school around. Within 2 years of her arrival, kindergarten students at Broad Acres were mastering early reading skills at higher rates than other schools in the district. After 3 years, Broad Acres students were meeting or exceeding all requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act. She has a rare gift for touching hearts and minds, inspiring in her students to aim high and believe in their potential. A Broad Acres parent says, She knows how to talk to the children so they will listen. And all her students know that she cares about them. She made them all feel like they were smart and could learn anything. One of her colleagues says, When you walk into Ms. Oliver's classroom, one cannot help but notice that this is a special place. She is dedicated to her school community and committed to excellence, and she has been an instrumental force in improving student achievement at her school. I have high expectations for each of them. I teach them that they can accomplish anything with hard work and persistence. Kim Oliver understands that the key to helping children succeed is fighting the soft bigotry of low expectations. America is blessed to have teachers like Kim Oliver. We are blessed to have teachers like all those who are gathered here at the White House.

This week we have seen a good example of what happens when people talk to each other instead of shout at each other. And unfortunately, we have also seen what happens when some people go to unreasonable lengths to prevent reasonable discussion and decisionmaking. I am speaking to you from the Pacific Northwest where we have just concluded the Forest Conference. how best to preserve jobs and protect the forests in this beautiful and productive region of our great Nation. Yesterday in Portland, Oregon, timber workers, business people, environmentalists, and community leaders sat down together in a conference room, not a courtroom. We discussed how to achieve a healthy economy and a healthy environment. And I directed my Cabinet to come back within 60 days with a plan for a balanced policy. Grass roots Americans want to end the gridlock and get the economy moving. They want to follow the same practice that we followed in Oregon yesterday. Unfortunately, some people in Washington, DC, have not gotten the message that the people want fundamental change. Yesterday the minority party in the Senate used procedural tactics to prevent the entire Senate from voting on our jobs and economic recovery package, which has already been passed overwhelmingly by the House of Representatives. After 3 years, when America lost one million jobs in the private sector, the unemployment rate remained unchanged in March, and the total number of jobs in our economy actually declined. Now, some folks in Washington may think everything is fine, but all across America the people understand there will not be a real recovery until our working men and women can look forward to a secure, high-wage future for themselves and their children. The people know that America needs our plan to put 500,000 Americans back to work by beginning the investments we need in a stronger, smarter economy. It is time to move beyond the old politics of partisanship, posturing, and procedural delays and start working together to solve problems. And just as this works in our own country, so too can it work between ourselves and other nations. That is why I am taking my first trip out of the country today to meet with Russia's democratically elected President, Boris Yeltsin. Nowhere is progress toward democracy and free markets more important to us than in Russia and the new independent states of the former Soviet Union. Their progress presents a great security challenge and offers great economic opportunities.

Now we can reduce that spending because the arms and armies of the former Soviet Union pose a greatly reduced threat to us and to our allies. If Russia were to revert to its old ways or plunge into chaos, we would need to reassess our plans for defense savings. That could mean less money for creating new businesses and new jobs, less for preparing our children for the future, less for education. Our economic program at home, more jobs and greater incomes for Americans, could be jeopardized if the reforms in Russia fail. My discussions with President Yeltsin involve measures intended to help the Russian people make the difficult transition to a market economy by helping themselves. Just as we mobilized the world on behalf of war in the Gulf, we must now mobilize the world on behalf of peace and reform in Russia. Most of this effort will have to come from the Russian people themselves. They will chart the path to their own future. These efforts to offer an historic chance to improve our own security, however, require some action by ourselves, too. Russia still holds over 20,000 strategic and tactical nuclear warheads. We are implementing historic arms control agreements that for the first time will actually reduce the level of strategic nuclear weapons. By supporting Russia's reforms we can help turn the promise of those agreements into reality for ourselves and for our children and for the Russian people and their children as well. And we can make life in America more safe and prosperous. For too long, work in Washington on issues like economics, the environment, and foreign policy took place in isolation.

Now, I ask you to call or write your Senators.

He is up here visiting, and if he takes as long to make the calls today as he did to speak in Atlanta, we will never get out of here. I really appreciated that. Anyway, so the game starts, and the next time the sides change, I look up in the stands, and this tall guy stands up and walks down, comes out to the pitcher's mound, shakes my hand, and says, I am Chevy Chase.

You know, before I got here I really did not understand how things so often came across in the country so different than they are up here.

When I talked to Hillary about running for President, Iin a very personal way, I did not really want to do it.

If you think about your own life, whenever you did anything really different and took on a new challenge, it was always with a mixture of hope and fear, when you went to school the first day or first went off to college or had your first job or first sought elective office or married or had your first child. A delicate balance always has to be maintained between hope and fear. And every day we all get up and we see things that are happening that we do not like or we are unsure what will happen to us. And it is almost as if we have a scale inside us, with blind justice holding it, and hope is on one side and fear is on the other. And each day it may take a little different balance.

And just last week, at the annual vote of International Economists, for the first time in 9 years, it was the United States of America that was voted as having the most productive economy in the world. We have got a long way to go, but we have made a good beginning. And Senator Kennedy for years has been interested in this whole crime issue from his service on the Judiciary Committee. But Joe Biden will tell you they talked about crime around here for 6 years, but we finally passed the crime bill that is tough with punishment, tough in terms of putting 100,000 police on the street, but also smart in providing prevention and giving people a chance to turn away from lives of crime and giving our young people a chance to have something to say yes to. Also, for the first time in my memory we put together back-to-back victories with the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban, in spite of the ferocious opposition of the NRA. We have got a long way to go, but it is a pretty good beginning. If you look at what was done to make Government work for ordinary people, in the economic plan, we reformed the college loan program the Secretary of Education is here tonight making 20 million Americans, including over 840,000 in the State of Massachusetts, eligible for low-interest loans at longer repayment terms, a stunning benefit for middle class kids, not just poor kids, so that no one need ever walk away from the challenge of paying for a college education againyou can clap for that; Ted Kennedy was for it.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksreceptionforsenatoredwardmkennedymcleanvirginia", "title": "Remarks at a Reception for Senator Edward M.

We are going to have 2 million more children immunized by 1996, so that all the kids under 2 will be immunized and parents can go to work not worrying about whether their children are going to be safe from preventable childhood diseases. Fifteen million working people and their children are going to get income tax cuts because they work hard and they raise their kids but they are hovering just above the poverty line, and we do not want them to fall into the poverty line and quit working and go on welfare. This is a pro-work, pro-family administration making this Government work for ordinary citizens again. Finally, let me say to our friends in the other party, I sat out there in the heartland of America as the Governor for years and years and years, and I heard them talk about how terrible the Federal Government was and how big and bloated it was. But we, the Democrats, voted to reduce the size of the Federal Government by 272,000, to make it the smallest it is been since President Kennedy was in office. We have already done over 70,000 of those reductions. And every last red cent of reduction in the Federal Government is going to local government and to local communities to help them fight crime. That is the record of the Democrats in the last 2 years. Now, if you compare that to what our opponents have done and what they have said, it is a pretty big difference. In the name of partisanship, they tried to stop the crime bill. They voted entirely against the economic program, a program that gave college loan breaks to millions of kids, a program that made 90 percent of the small businesses in this country eligible for tax cuts and gave tax reductions to 15 million working families.

There are 5 million Americans in working families today who had health insurance 5 years ago who do not have it today, even though we spend 40 percent more of our income than any other country on health care. If you want to preserve the integrity of our great medical institutions of higher learning, if you want to see health insurance for all Americans and stability in our economy long-term and in our Federal budget long-term, we have got to address the health care issue. So what if we could not do it in a year. It took 7 years to pass the Brady bill, 7 years to pass family leave, 7 years to pass motor voter, 6 years to pass the crime bill. I signed a banking reform bill today that they have been working on longer than anybody can remember. We can do this. We will do this. The people of Massachusetts, I do not believe, want to send a signal to Washington, DC, that they have abandoned health care. I think they want to tell us to keep at it until we get it right. And the only way to do that is to say, Senator Kennedy, stay on the job; keep doing it until we get it right. My friends, you will see this election everywhere in America played out. He is running against someone who signed the contract, a contract against health care reform, for cutting Medicare, for exploding the deficit, for putting the Federal budget in a place where they will not even be able to fund the crime billthe same old promises, tell them what they want to hear, bad-mouth Government, bad-mouth the people who are the instruments of change, and hope you do not get caught.

He was once the youngest man in the Senate for quite a long time. Well, I was once the youngest Governor in America by 9 years.

{"id": 5986, "text": "I think all of you can see before me the results of a tremendous amount of work and cooperation among all those in our Government who are interested in the present and future strength of our Nation's number one economic resource, and that is agriculture. I think it is also accurate to point out that more than has ever been the case in the past, that professional nutritionists and their representatives, private citizens, consumer groups, have been involved in the preparation of this legislation. Another fact that I think would be undisputed is that in the last 40 years, there has never been such a far-reaching and important piece of legislation passed relating to American agriculture. This is an important concept for us all. We are very eager to continue our preeminent position in international agricultural trade circles. Public Law 480, which permits us to dispose of American food products in a beneficial way, is enhanced. Foreign trade with the sale of our own agricultural commodities is enhanced. We have in this bill, too, a new approach to the food stamp question. This has sometimes been considered as an anomaly or an anachronism in a modern day Department of Agriculture. But I think this legislation that has been included in the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 is a great step forward in providing a simple food stamp system and one that would be easy to administer, one that is more equitable, which eliminates the pervasive threat of fraud. I'd also like to point out that this bill includes many other features--a renewed emphasis and an enhancement of our research program in agriculture that is so important to every family. It, for the first time, makes a major step toward tying target prices to actual production costs. This has been one of the most controversial issues that the Congress has had to face. Obviously, because production costs vary so widely from one community to another, and a bill of this kind has to deal with average prices or cost of production throughout the country, there still remain and will inevitably remain some inequities. But this bill makes a giant step toward tying target prices with production costs, and it also narrows its focus on individual commodities so that there can be more equity insured. This bill also sets up a means for maintaining adequate food reserves. Although we have been blessed recently with bountiful crops, we do not have an excessive reserve supply of crucial food and feed items on hand.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningintolawthefoodandagricultureact1977", "title": "Remarks on Signing Into Law the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-into-law-the-food-and-agriculture-act-1977", "publication_date": "29-09-1977", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Jimmy Carter"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 5987, "text": "This bill permits us to maintain adequate reserves, and it also encompasses a provision that is very dear to me, and that is that most of the reserves will be under the control of farmers and that there is a very careful safeguard against the dumping of agricultural products on the market, artificially, to force prices down and, therefore, to damage the economy of farm families. We have moved in this bill to correct a very serious economic problem that exists among the farm communities of our Nation by increasing target and loan prices for the 1977 crop. And I believe that this will certainly be a good investment both this year and in the future. Another aspect of this bill that particularly ,appeals to me is the reduction of Government interference in the agricultural economy. This is always devoutly to be sought, and I think the Congress has very wisely achieved this goal in this current legislation. We have eliminated acreage allotments. Quite often in the past, acreage allotments historically have evolved into a financial measure of the benefit of Government programs, and they are bought and traded like actual property. This bill moves to eliminate those acreage allotments. We have also maintained an important element in the set-aside authority for the Agriculture Secretary. And very shortly now, set-aside regulations will be promulgated by this Department. And I think the cost of this bill, because of its wise drafting, will be less and less as the future years go by. We have an exceptional case at the present time in agriculture, where additional expenditures are required. One of the elements of agricultural legislation and appropriations which is often overlooked is that at least half the costs that are normally attributed to an agricultural bill are actually in the form of redeemable loans. And this is not an expenditure from the Federal Government; it is an investment in a very good and sound commodity. The loan is secured and the loans are repaid, but under our present accounting system, this is identified as an expenditure, and it tends to distort in the public mind the degree of Federal investment in agriculture. I'd like to close by saying that I am very proud of the good work that has been done this year, and in years gone by, by Senator Talmadge, the chairman of the Senate committee and, of course, by Tom Foley and Bob Poage and all those Democrats and Republicans who've worked with them, both within the committee and on the floor of Congress.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningintolawthefoodandagricultureact1977", "title": "Remarks on Signing Into Law the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-into-law-the-food-and-agriculture-act-1977", "publication_date": "29-09-1977", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Jimmy Carter"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I would not be able to report as correctly the views of any one of you. I do not know how you get before the country so clearly and so well my views as you do. And I also want to thank you for the consideration with which you have always treated the Presidential office during the time that I have been President.

I was not able to do a great lot with the reduc-tion of expenditures, but we did keep expenditures down fairly well. There was no bill of general importance that passed that I did not approve. I sent up a couple of veto messages of personal and local significance and there were three or four bills that I decided not to sign. One of them I had not been able to make up my mind about it. That is the bill relative to taxation of lands in Oregon and Washington. That did not come in until just as I was about to leave the office to go to lunch and from lunch to the Capitol, so I did not have a chance to investigate it. I am investigating it now to see whether I ought to approve it or leave it disapproved. The tax measure I would say was the most important piece of legislation.

The Lausanne treaty and the treaty relative to the sale of arms and the use of gas did not come up for final consideration. The Railroad Labor Bill will we hope develop into a very important policy, because of the significance of it of leaving the management of the railroads and the employees to agree among themselves with the very manifest disposition of a new desire on their part to harmonize difficulties that may arise and adjust them without the interference of the Government. And of course there is the building law which really represented a new policy of making a lump sum appropriation and leaving the administration of it and the disposition of it to the Secretary of the Treasury. I also believe the Postmaster General comes in on things that are of interest to the Post Office Department. Then the aviation bill was very important, which also is the adoption of a new policy of administration. With the great amount of discussion that had been going on through the summer months in relation to the aviation situation, the present bill is in a very wonderful way, I think, almost in entire harmony with the recommendations made by the Navy Air Board, a considerable step in advance. We passed a bill that had been agreed upon in the fall as a result of conferences between the Secretary of Agriculture and the Cooperative Farm Associations that is of considerable importance for the betterment of the cooperative farm movement in the country. I spoke of the two treaties. Another matter of importance which awaits future action is legislation relative to the licensing of radio plants. I think those are the principal features of this Congress. But the fact remains that no legislation of general import was passed that did not have my approval and in all the main features that I desired to have the Congress act upon I secured favorable action. I happened to express it in that way. I think some of the success of the present Congress was due to the fact that they assumed very largely their own responsibility and undertook to function as an independent legislative body without too much interference on the part of the Executive or too much subservience to the wishes of the Executive. That is I mean, trying to determine questions on their merits. As a result of that policy there was very little of partisanship that was shown in the decision of any large questions. There is another item that I left out, which of course is of tremendous importance, and that is the settlement of our foreign debts.

And so part of my goal here is just to say thank you to them and let them know how much I appreciate the counsel, the advice, the leadership that they have consistently shown throughout my time in office.

I take especial satisfaction in this day. As the recipient of an honorary degree in 1956 from Boston College, and therefore an instant alumnus, I am particularly pleased to be with all of you on this most felicitous occasion. This university, or college, as Father Walsh has described, was founded in the darkest days of the Civil War, when this Nation was engaged in a climactic struggle to determine whether it would be half slave and half free or all free. And now, 100 years later, after the most intense century perhaps in human history, we are faced with the great question of whether this world will be half slave and half free, or whether it will be all one or the other. And on this occasion, as in 1863, the services of Boston College are still greatly needed. It is good also to participate in this ceremony which has honored three distinguished citizens of the free world--President Pusey, Father Bunn, and our friend from the world of freedom, Lady Jackson. Boston College is a hundred years old-old by the life span of men, but young by that of universities. In this week of observance, you have rightly celebrated the achievements of the past, and equally rightly you have turned in a series of discussions by outstanding scholars to the problems of the present and the future. Learned men have been talking here of the knowledge explosion, and in all that they have said I am sure they have implied the heavy present responsibility of institutions like this one. Yet today I want to say a word on the same theme, to impress upon you as urgently as I can the growing and insistent importance of universities in our national life. I speak of universities because that is what Boston College has long since become. But most of what I say applies to liberal arts colleges as well. My theme is not limited to any one class of universities, public or private, religious or secular. Our national tradition of variety in higher education shows no sign of weakening, and it remains the task of each of our institutions to shape its own role among its differing sisters. In this hope I am much encouraged by a reading in this last week of the remarkable encyclical, Pacem in Terris.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthebostoncollegecentennialceremonies", "title": "Address at the Boston College Centennial Ceremonies", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-boston-college-centennial-ceremonies", "publication_date": "20-04-1963", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["John F.

As a Catholic I am proud of it; and as an American I have learned from it. It only adds to the impact of this message that it closely matches notable expressions of conviction and aspiration from churchmen of other faiths, as in recent documents of the World Council of Churches, and from outstanding world citizens with no ecclesiastical standing. We are learning to talk the language of progress and peace across the barriers of sect and creed. It seems reasonable to hope that a similar process may be taking place across the quite different barriers of higher learning. From the office that I hold, in any case, there can be no doubt today of the growing meaning of universities in America. That, of course, is one basic reason for the increasing urgency with which those who care most for the progress of our society are pressing for more adequate programs in higher education and in education generally. It is for this reason that I urge upon everyone here and in this country the pressing need for national attention and a national decision in the national interest upon the national question of education. In at least four ways, the new realities of our day have combined to intensify the focal role of the university in our Nation's life. First, and perhaps most obvious, the whole world has come to our doorstep and the universities must be its student. In the strange geometry of modern politics, the distant Congo can be as close to us as Canada, and Canada, itself, is worth more attention than we have sometimes given. Crises we did not create require our participation. Second, there is indeed an explosion of knowledge and its outward limits are not yet in sight. In some fields, progress seems very fast; in others, distressingly slow. It is no tribute to modern science to jump lightly to the conclusion that all its secrets of particle physics, of molecular life, of heredity, of outer space, are now within easy reach. It is that wherever we turn, in defense, in space, in medicine, in industry, in agriculture, and most of all in basic science, itself, the requirement is for better work, deeper understanding, higher education.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthebostoncollegecentennialceremonies", "title": "Address at the Boston College Centennial Ceremonies", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-boston-college-centennial-ceremonies", "publication_date": "20-04-1963", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["John F.

{"id": 5993, "text": "And while I have framed this comment in the terms of the natural sciences, I insist, as do all those who live in this field, that at every level of learning there must be an equal concern for history, for letters and the arts, and for man as a social being in the widest meaning of Aristotle's phrase. This also is the work of the university. And third, as the world presses in and knowledge presses out, the role of the interpreter grows. Men can no longer know everything themselves; the 20th century has no universal man. All men today must learn to know through one another--to judge across their own ignorance--to comprehend at second hand. Those who would practice them must develop intensity of perception, variety of mental activity, and the habit of open concern for truth in all its forms. Where can we expect to find a training ground for this modern maturity, if not in our universities? Fourth and finally, these new requirements strengthen still further what has always been a fundamental element in the life of American colleges and universities--that they should be dedicated to the Nation's service. The phrase is Woodrow Wilson's, and no one has discussed its meaning better. What he said in 1896 is more relevant today than ever before, and I close with a quotation from him. I offer it to you with renewed congratulations, and in the confident hope that as the second century opens, Boston College will continue to respond--as she did in her beginnings-to the new needs of the age. It is not learning, said President Wilson, but the spirit of service that will give a college place in the public annals of the Nation. It is indispensable, he said, if it is to do its right service, that the air of affairs should be admitted to all its classrooms... the air of the world's transactions, the consciousness of the solidarity of the race, the sense of the duty of man toward man the promise and the hope that shine in the face of all knowledge .... The days of glad expansion are gone, our life grows tense and difficult; our resource for the future lies in careful thought, providence, and a wise economy; and the school must be of the Nation.

It is a year in which we have an opportunity to work with others to shape the future of our globe. We have a chance to achieve peace. We have a chance to achieve a more compassionate world for every citizen. America believes deeply that everybody has worth, everybody matters, everybody was created by the Almighty, and we are going to act on that belief, and we will act on that passion. You know, the world looks at us and say, They are strong. We are strong militarily, but we have got a greater strength than that. We have got a strength in the universality of human rights and the human condition. It is in our country's history. It is ingrained in our soul. And today we are going to describe how we are going to act, not just talk, but act, on the basis of our firm beliefs. I want to thank Tommy; he is the new chairman of the board of the Global Fund. He is also the Secretary of Health and Human Services, doing a great job for our administration. I want to thank so very much the Ambassadors from Guyana and Uganda for standing up here with us today. I appreciate the other ambassadors from the continent of Africa and the Caribbean for being here. With us as well is Bill Frist, a United States Senator, majority leader, passionate advocate of good health care for every citizen on the globe, a man with whom this administration will work, along with Russ Feingold, from Wisconsin, to make sure that the proposal becomes real. There is no doubt in my mind that when you have got the majority leader and a distinguished Senator like Senator Feingold teaming up together, that this will get done. It is just a matter of time. I am honored that Mark Malloch is here Mark Malloch Brown is here, who is the U.N. administrator of the U.N. Development Program. I want to thank the U.S. Surgeon General Carmona is here with us.

He cares deeply, and his care has had he is got a lot of influence, let me put it to you this way, because of his convictions. As I mentioned, we are a strong nation, but we are also a blessed nation, and it is important for our citizens to recognize it. Richness is one thing; recognizing that we are blessed gives a different perspective, I think. I think it enhances the fact that we have a responsibility. If you are blessed, there is a responsibility to recognize your blessings in a compassionate way. We have got to understand in this country that if you value life and say every life is equal, that includes a suffering child on the continent of Africa. If you are worried about freedom, that is just not freedom for your neighbor in America; that is freedom for people around the globe. As I said in my State of the Union, freedom is not America's gift to the world; freedom is God's gift to humanity. Freedom means freedom from a lot of things. And today, on the continent of Africa, freedom means freedom from the fear of a deadly pandemic. That is what we think in America, and we are going to act on that belief. Our founding belief in human dignity should be how we conduct ourselves around the world and will be how we conduct ourselves around the world. I want you all to remember, and our fellow citizens to remember, that this is nothing new for our country. Human dignity has been a part of our history for a long time. We fed the hungry after World War I. This country carried out the Marshall plan and the Berlin airlift. Today we provide 60 percent over 60 percent of all the international food aid. We are acting on our compassion. It is nothing new for our country. But there is a pandemic which we must address now, before it is too late. And that is why I took this message to our fellow citizens, that now is the time for this country to step up our efforts to save lives. After all, on the continent of Africa, 30 million people have the ENTITY virus 30 million people. Three million children under the age of 15 have the ENTITY virus. More than 4 million people require immediate drug treatment.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheemergencyplanforaidsrelief", "title": "Remarks on the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-emergency-plan-for-aids-relief", "publication_date": "31-01-2003", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

Tommy mentioned the images, the horrible images, that take place in Africa. It is important for our fellow citizens, as they listen to the dialog on this initiative, to understand that there are mass burials and unmarked graves on the continent of Africa. The pandemic is creating such havoc that there are mass burials, that there are wards of children that are dying because of ENTITY, not a ward, not some wards, but wards after wards full of dying children because of ENTITY, that there are millions of orphans, lonely children, because their mom or dad has died children left, in some cases, to fend for themselves. Because the ENTITY diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many folks do not seek treatment, and that is a reality. It is as if the ENTITY pandemic just continues to feed upon itself over and over and over again, because of hopelessness. This country needs to provide some hope, because this disease can be prevented and it can be treated. Anti-retroviral drugs are now dramatically more affordable in many nations, and these drugs are used to extend the lives of those with ENTITY. In other words, these drugs are really affordable. And when the treatment has come to Africa, it is also important for our citizens to understand the effect of that treatment. When one patient is rescued by medicine, as if back from the dead, many others with ENTITY seek testing and treatment, because it is the first sign of hope they have ever seen. We have the opportunity to bring that hope to millions. It is an opportunity for this Nation to affect millions and millions of lives. And so that is why I have laid out the Emergency Plan for ENTITY Relief. I called it in my State of the Union a work of mercy, and that is what I believe it is. With approval of Congress, we will devote $15 billion to the fight ENTITY abroad over the next 5 years, beginning with 2 billion in the year 2004. I have been asked whether or not we are committed to the Global ENTITY Fund. Well, first of all, I would not put Tommy as the head of it if we were not . And so we are still committed to the Global ENTITY Fund to fight disease. This program in no way diminishes our commitment to the fund.

You notice I did not say, focus our efforts, I said, dramatically focus our efforts. And that is important for the American people to understand, because we want to bring a comprehensive system. It is more than money that we bring; we bring expertise and compassion and love and the desire to develop a comprehensive system, work with people in Africa to do so, for diagnosis and treatment and prevention. We are determined to turn the tide against ENTITY. And we are going to start in 14 African and Caribbean countries, where the disease is most heavily concentrated. We whip it in those 15 or 14 we will show what is possible in other countries. We are going to be involved with the fund. We will continue to have bilateral aid. We want to have intense focus where the need is most severe and show the world what is possible not just show our fellow citizens or show the folks on the continent of Africa, but the world needs to see what we can do together. The model has been applied with great success in Uganda. Anybody who knows the issue of ENTITY on the African Continent appreciates the efforts of Uganda. Even though we are on 14 countries initially with this major focus, we understand there is suffering elsewhere. We want to encourage others to join us as well. The funding will initially go toward expanding existing hospitals and, of course, drawing on the knowledge and the expertise of local physicians. That makes sense. You have got a doc in place, we want to encourage that doc to be able to continue his or her healing. We will build satellite facilities that can serve more people. Of course, we will provide antiretroviral drugs and as well work with folks on the ground for education and care. It is important for our citizens to know that the infrastructure is it is hard for many Americans to imagine the lack of infrastructure that we are working with on the continent of Africa. So we use motorcycles, trucks, bicycles. We use nurses and local healers to go to the farthest villages and farms to test for the disease and to deliver medications that will save lives.

He leads an organization that provides testing and treatment in Nairobi. He is helped thousands of people every year.

And that is what we are here to talk about today, how best to save lives. that in this decade, we will prevent 7 million new infections; that we will treat at least 2 million people with life-extending drugs. We will provide humane care, of course, for those who suffer and, as importantly, for the orphans. To me, that is just the beginning. Most important thing is we are providing hope, which is immeasurable. How can you possibly measure the benefits of hope? There is no we cannot quantify that. But it certainly can be qualified by saying a hopeful society is a heck of a lot better society than what they found on the continent today. This project is urgent, and as we move forward on this program we will continue to call upon other nations to join. The United States does not mind leading, and we believe others have a responsibility as well, that we are not the only blessed nation. And we hope they join us. And as well we have got a lot of work to do here in America. It is important for our fellow citizens never to think that one initiative or a major initiative in Africa does not mean we are going to forget the 900,000 people living in America today who carry the ENTITY virus. Of course we will never do that. It is important for our citizens to understand that there is 40,000 new infections every year in this country. The ENTITY diagnosis still obviously brings tremendous grief and worries in parts of our society.

And for all of you who are covering this who are not from one of the two States, let me the game was an unbelievable game, and Arkansas was ahead at the end. And there was only a minute and a half to go, and we seemed to have an insurmountable lead. And our quarterback was trying to kill the clock, a little of the clock.

Now, in the Super Bowl, the Packers showed just what a championship team is made of and that you deserved those rings Coach McCarthy had you fitted on the night before.

Back in the twenties, fans passed the hat at the games to support the team. In 1923, after some rough financial years, local businessmen banded together to pay the bills. Two more timesin 1935 and 1950the community came to the rescue to keep the club afloat, and today, 112,000 people own a piece of this franchise. It is the only publicly owned team in pro sports, so . And after the Super Bowl, hundreds of those fans woke up the next day, put on their snow boots, and headed over to Lambeau Field to shovel it out for the victory pep rally. The Packers have raised more than $4 million for charities in communities all across Wisconsin and Michigan. More than 300 schools participate in the Packers Fit Kids program to promote childhood health. They have given scholarships to local students, sponsored food and blood drives, found creative ways to support our troops and their families.

Little more than a year's passed since our program went on the books, but already we have made solid progress against four of the five problems that we inherited. We have cut the growth of spending somewhere around in half, and we have reduced high inflation, high interest rates, and taxation. But let me just say something here about interest rates, which I will expand on in my speech to the Nation tonight. The very sharp and heartening decline that we have seen in interest rates brings us one step closer to the dream every American shares, which is lasting recovery. But let us understand that what brought, for example, Government-backed home mortgages down to 12 1/2 percent, the lowest level in 25 months, was not a quick fix, but our progress against inflation. The decline in inflation led directly to the fall in interest rates during the last several months. The Federal Reserve Bank announced last week that it was lowering its discount level to 9 1/2 percent. That is the first time this key interest rate has been a single digit since 1979 and the fifth reduction in the rate in 4 months. The Fed's lower rate shows its confidence that inflation and market interest rates are continuing to fall. The Federal Reserve has been pursuing a steady policy of trying to reduce inflation, and we have been supporting the Fed in that policy. And the Fed will continue to aim its policy at bringing inflation down further in the future. And that will continue to mean lower and lower interest rates as well. As I said, we are solving four of the five worst problems that we inherited. But unemployment, always the lagging indicator, remains too high, and clearly, our most urgent priority today is to create lasting, private sector jobs. I am not going to rest until every American who wants a job can find a job. Unemployment is a tragedy for all Americans in every region, every city, and every line of work.

Two out of every five people out of work-two out of every five are between the ages of 16 and 24. We continue to push for enterprise zones in our inner cities, a program to attract new businesses and jobs to areas of highest unemployment. It is tragic that this enterprise zone proposal has been bottled up in committee by the leadership of the House. I remember what it was like to be 21 years old and looking for a job in 1932. And I know how it feels when your future has been mortgaged by the generation before you. Today's young people must never be held hostage to the mistakes of the past. The only way to avoid making these mistakes again is to learn from them. It is estimated, for example, that at least 20 million American workers now rely on skills that will not be needed within 20 years. The government has trained thousands more in skills that already are not needed in their communities. Still others have been steered into make-work government for our young people. And that is why I am proud today to sign into law the Job Training Partnership Act, a program that looks to the future instead of the past. This is not another make-work, dead-end, bureaucratic boondoggle. This program will train more than one million Americans every year in skills they can market where they live. It will make a difference on Main Street. It will provide help, bring hope, and encourage self-reliance and personal initiative. State and local government officials, business and labor leaders, and other members of the private sector will plan area programs in private industry councils. Local people will decide at the grass roots level what opportunities are available in their communities, and then match real jobs with needed skills. And here is something else that makes this program different from many past failures. At least 70 percent of the program funds will go to actual job training.

These recommendations, based on the latest and best medical evidence, give clear, consistent guidance to women in our national fight against breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. It affects one in eight women in their lifetimes and has touched the families of nearly every American, including my own. We may not yet have a cure for breast cancer, but we do know that early detection and early treatment are our most potent weapons against this dread disease and we know that mammography can save lives. That is why it is important to send a clear, consistent message to women and to their families about when to start getting mammograms and how often to repeat them. After careful study of the science, the National Cancer Advisory Board has now concluded that women between the ages of 40 and 49 should get a mammography examination for breast cancer every 1 or 2 years, in consultation with their doctors. The National Cancer Institute has now accepted these recommendations. Now women in their forties will have clear guidance based on the best science, and action to match it. Today I am taking action to bring Medicare, Medicaid, and the Federal employee health plans in line with the National Cancer Institute's recommendations. First, in the Medicare budget I am sending to Congress today I am making annual screening mammography exams, beginning at age 40, a covered expense without coinsurance or deductibles. Second, Secretary Shalala is sending a letter to State Medicaid directors urging them to also cover annual mammograms beginning at 40 and assuring them that the Federal Government will pay its matching share if they do so. And today I am directing the Office of Personnel Management to require all Federal health benefit plans to comply with the National Cancer Advisory Board's recommendations on mammogram screenings, beginning next year. The Federal Government is doing its part to make sure women have both coverage and access to this potentially lifesaving test. I want to challenge private health insurance plans to do the same. They, too, should cover regular screening mammograms for women 40 and over. Finally, we know there has been much discussion on this issue and a lot of confusion.

And this inspires me to tell you a little bit of what we are trying to do, how truly simple it is, and therefore, to see whether we may not draw even a little closer together because of the simplicity of these ideas and, I think, the fact that we see all right-thinking Americans should be for, in general this kind of thing. Carter Glass once went to a great university. He was to receive an honorary degree of doctor of laws; and the dean of the law school, in presenting him to the president of the university, read a long citation. This citation had to deal largely, almost exclusively, with the long record of Carter Glass's integrity, his absolute unimpeachable honesty as a public servant throughout his life. It dwelt on this theme in numerous ways and I think even quoted examples. My friends, I think I should decline to receive this decoration, because if the time has come when the American people and their great institutions of learning find it proper or necessary or desirable to decorate a man and give him awards because he is honest in the public service, then I despair of the Republic. This, he said, is something you can demand of your public servants; you do not .have to reward them for it. You can demand it through the proper use of your authority as an American citizen, through the ballot box, and you can see that you get good men--honest men and women in government. ' ' We are very apt, when we speak about government in Washington, to think of some rather amorphous, distant, bewildering, comprehensive, complex thing. We do not really know what we mean when we say government. We realize there is a President up there, and a few leaders in the Senate and the House, and we sort of have them visualized; and the rest of it is just a bunch of bureaucrats. government is nothing in the world but men and women that you select and send to fill the several offices.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthebreakfastlosangelesgivenrepublicangroupssoutherncalifornia", "title": "Remarks at the Breakfast in Los Angeles Given by Republican Groups of Southern California", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-breakfast-los-angeles-given-republican-groups-southern-california", "publication_date": "24-09-1954", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Dwight D.

It is just that silly, to talk about going back to that kind of thing. Now, how do we get a man that is that flexible, that adjustable? We want men that can take and listen to facts, who are not so doctrinaire that every fact that is brought in front of them, if it does not agree with their preconceptions, it is just thrown out in the woodpile.

As a matter of fact, some of you may know I made a little speech about it last night. Now, of course, none of us is in detail going to agree entirely with that program, because no program, if it is made up as I have been trying to describe to you, is reflective of any single person's complete ideas. But if it follows the general purpose, the good of 160 million people, if it is supported by honest men and women who want nothing in the world but the good of those people, and if it has been intelligently, broadly based, then I think we have got something that we ought to be able to sell.

It is much easier, you know, to get up and say everybody is a so-and-so except my little gang and me, than it is to go out and sell a really constructive truth, because we tend to take it for granted. Well, I think that the Administration, probably, is not capable of telling anybody how to dramatize these truths, these programs, and carry them out so that people will overwhelmingly accept them. I believe that if you carry the truth to the people, that there will be only one decision from the mass of 160 million Americans. I am going to end this little talk with a little story.

I talked to his doctor just an hour ago. The doctor is a former classmate of mine at college. I know him very well, so I can assure you the information is correct. The doctor has told the President in very strict terms to rest this morning.

Although there have been minor grammatical changes in pronouns, this is the President's speech. We come to Japan at the culmination of a long and productive journey. Today we stand at a turning point in history. The Soviet Union has vanished and with it the delusions of communism. Centuries-old enemies in the Middle East are tempering ancient hatreds in pursuit of peace. Freedom's phoenix is rising from the ashes of tyranny in nations from Latin America to Eastern Europe and from Cambodia to Mongolia. Freedom's rebirth was painful, its triumphs inscribed in blood, its truce seared by the fires of war and sacrifice. First, that isolationism and protectionism lead to war and deprivation; and second, that political engagement and open trade lead to peace and prosperity. These last few years we again learned of the power of ideas. Technologies that transmit ideas in the blink of an eye carry the human spirit over barricades and through barbed wire. They hurdle walls designed to hold back the truth. We live in a world transformed, shrunken by swift travel and instant communication, drawn closer by common interests and ambitions, propelled forward by people's imaginations and dreams. As leaders of this transforming world, the United States and Japan must help build a new international order based on the rule of law, respect for human rights, and political and economic liberty.

Our two-way trade is now $310 billion annually, one-third larger than that with Europe. American businesses cannot flourish in Asia unless the economies of Asia thrive and grow. At the same time, Japan's growth needs American markets open and growing. Since 1975, the number of Americans of Asian origin has nearly quadrupled. What happens here is very important to us. And at the core of our continuing Asian engagement stands our alliance with Japan. At each stop during his visit to the region, the President has stressed the challenges we must face, addressing the new security requirements of our transforming world, promoting democracy, and generating world economic growth and prosperity. Let me expand upon that by focusing on the special relationship that the United States enjoys with Japan. Rarely in history have two nations with such different and differing historic cultural roots developed such an extraordinary relationship. Our people are bound by shared security, by democracy, and by our deep economic ties. There are those who doubt the future of this relationship. Here in Japan you have a saying, Some rain must fall to prepare the ground for building. We can all see that without progress we may be in for some rough weather. And I must be frank in saying that there are problems in our economic relationship. Speaking not only for the United States but for many developed countries, Japan's trade surplus is too high, and its market access too restricted. President Bush has come to Japan as a friend, seeking solutions to these concerns, believing that the expansion of free and fair trade will do nothing but strengthen our relationship. We in the United States are confident about our capacity for partnership. Our areas of common interest are too important. We enjoy a strong security bond with Japan. Japan's generous host-nation support for U.S. forces stationed here is an important demonstration of shared responsibilities. Let us make the most efficient use of our defense resources by building greater coordination of our military forces and by promoting the two-way flow of defense technology. Such cooperation enhances our security and builds even stronger political ties between us. The Gulf crisis sparked spirited debate here about Japan's global role.

What will be your benchmarks for success? The most important task for all of us is to deliver a strong message of unity in the face of crisis. Number one, all the participating countries recognize that in the face a severe global contraction we have to each take steps to promote economic growth and trade; that means a robust approach to stimulus, fighting off protectionism. Next, we have to make sure that we are all taking serious steps to deal with the problems in the banking sector and the financial markets and that means having a series of steps to deal with toxic assets and to ensure adequate capital in the banking sector. Third, a regulatory reform agenda that prevents these kinds of systemic risks from occurring again and that requires each country to take initiative, but it also requires coordination across borders because we have a global, we have global capital markets, and that will include a wide range of steps, additional monitoring authority coordination of supervisors and various countries dealing with offshore tax havens. I know that in my discussion I think there is a concern that we do not want people to be able to game the system or circumvent regulated capital markets and making sure our regulations are targeting not just banks but any institution that could pose a potential systemic risk to the system. A final area of concerted action involves international financial institutions and their capacity to assist emerging markets in developing countries at a time when those markets could be under even more severe strain then some of the more wealthy nations and I think making sure that institutions like the IMF have the resources to provide such assistance that world food supplies are not imperiled as a consequence of the break down in global trade, those are all issues that I think have to be addressed. Now, I am confident based on conversations that I have this week with Angela Merkel, Sarkozy, as well as with Kevin Rudd as well as conversations that I have had previously with Gordon Brown and others, that there is already a rough consensus there that by the time we arrive in London we will have taken, we will have made significant progress in moving in the right direction.

{"id": 1870, "text": "The press has tended to frame this as an either or approach . There are some G20 participants that are arguing fiercely for stimulus, others for regulation. What I have consistently argued is that what is needed is a both and approach . We need stimulus and we need regulation. We need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we are taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again. With respect to the stimulus, there is going to be an accord that G20 countries will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade. I think there is a legitimate concern that, would most countries already having initiated significant stimulus packages that we need to see how they work. Obviously, I admire economists. I have a bunch of them on my staff. But to start making a whole host of plans about next year, without having better information on how the current stimulus efforts are working, is something that I think is of concern. So, what we are going to see is what the United States has led on this. We have been very aggressive in terms of our recovery package. The way our recovery package is structured, money is going out both in 2009 and 2010. But each country has its own constraints, its own political rhythms and what we want to just make sure is that everybody is doing something, everybody recognizes the need to make progress on this front and that we are prepared to step into the breech should current efforts prove to be inadequate. I mean that is really the great challenge, in managing this crisis - bridging the gap between what is economically absolutely necessary and what is politically possible. How do you bridge that? Then there is a gap in ideas about how to approach a crisis like this, especially among economists - although on the issue of the stimulus there seems to be much broader consensus among both conservative and liberal economists that stimulus is appropriate. You know, the financial crisis hit the United States first; it is now being experienced around the world. Not surprisingly we took some very aggressive action earlier than some other countries because its impact had been felt most immediately on Wall Street. As other countries start experiencing these drastic declines in GDP and in their exports, I think that the sense of urgency has grown, and you are going to start seeing a convergence.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithlionelbarberchrystiafreelandandedwardlucethefinancialtimes", "title": "Interview with Lionel Barber, Chrystia Freeland, and Edward Luce of the Financial Times", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-lionel-barber-chrystia-freeland-and-edward-luce-the-financial-times", "publication_date": "27-03-2009", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

So that is always going to be a challenge and what is also difficult is the fact that the policies we initiate all take time to take effect and by its very nature politics looks for more instantaneous gratification. But I am confident that the American people, and I think people around the world, are looking to its leaders to lead and that some of the steps we have already taken are starting to bear fruit. We are seeing glimmers of stabilization in the economies and we have not yet seen... Here in the United States for example, you are starting to see pockets of stabilization in the housing market. Our housing plan has led to the lowest interest rates, mortgage rates in a very long time and you are starting to see a huge number of refinancing in the banking sector. In certain select markets, like the market for auto loans or the market for student loans, Secretary Tim Geithner's efforts to provide a market for asset-backed securities has helped and so we still have a long way to go, but I am confident that if we are persistent and we do not approach this with a thought that there is a silver bullet out there but instead are willing to try a range of methods to deliver on the economic growth in jobs that we will get out of this current crisis. You mentioned the risks and dangers of protectionism. 73 separate measures have been identified by the World Bank since the last G20 summit so what again in practical terms can your administration do at the G20 to stop this - and I am thinking to whether there are real risks that people worry in Europe a lot about what is going on, on Capitol Hill, with Buy American provisions. Well first of all, I think it is important to note that here in the United States, despite some protectionist rhetoric and very real economic frustration growing out of the collapse of the financial markets and the huge rise in unemployment that the Buy American provision that was in the stimulus package was specifically written that had to be consistent with WTO.

And to the extent that the American people or Europeans or Asians, Africans, Latin Americans all feel confident that their leaders are doing everything that they can to encourage and promote economic and that they have their populations interests at heart, I think we are going to be able to hold the line on any significant slippage. I wondered ENTITY whether you are concerned that, particularly following the AIG bonus controversy, there is some danger that confidence that business has in the rule of law in the United States has been shaken and that could hinder some of these recovery measures? I think it is a source of concern in some quarters. To the extent that the captains of industry recognize very legitimate frustrations that the American people feel when they read about huge bonuses going to members of firms that are receiving large tax payer bailouts. I think they can take steps to lessen that danger and I met with some bankers today and it was a constructive conversation but one of the points that I made is that a time when everybody is needing to sacrifice there has to be a similar sense of sacrifice on the part of those various sectors of the economy that helped to precipitate this crisis and to the extent that they are showing restraint that compensation packages are structured so that there is some deferral until money is returned to tax payers and the economy recovers that will be good for everybody. That will put in a stronger position to help them. But you know, keep in mind that although there are going to be, I think, emotional reactions to and legitimate grievances around some of these issues, the United States has been the world's most successful economy precisely because of a long-standing respect for legal contracts and orderly transparent and open market operations and that is not going to change.

And by the way, that is a- the second election was a really important moment in the liberty movement. And I thanked him for that, genuinely so. I thank him for that. Lithuania serves as a great example of what is possible. After years of being subjugated to harsh rule, the Lithuanians are now free, and they are showing they can grow the economy and that people have a chance to express themselves and there is a vibrant society when you are free.

It is important to have that sense of freedom as a source of vigor and strength, and a very important alliance. That is what I want to say.

It should help Russian security - that the cold war is over, that the United States does not view Russia as a threat and neither does NATO. So we have got to address our sights to the new threats. Relationship between Western democracies and Russia seems to be very friendly. But do you really trust President Putin? I press any leader that does not believe 100 percent in freedom, and of course I do-I am -freedom of the press or Chechnya or issues that indicate that there might not be a whole-hearted commitment to freedom of the people.

We believe everybody is precious; everybody counts; and that we are rooted, our whole history and our very being is rooted, on the notion of people being able to realize their dreams.

Lithuania brings a wonderful spirit of strength of purpose, of endurance. Secondly, as we change the military strategy to reflect the new threat-see, Russia is not a threat militarily. The threats that we now face come from a global terror network. And we will change our military capabilities to meet the strategies necessary to defeat terrorism. And Lithuania will have an important contribution to make, as will all countries in NATO. So the expansion of NATO will make it easier for us to defend the peace.

That is going to necessarily take away some borrowing availability of the newlywed looking for money to borrow for a home, for an automobile. You have asked the people to tough it out, to be patient on this kind of thing. And I realize I have reduced this to a simplistic term, but can you regard the question in that light, ENTITY? because this is not new, what has been happening to us. This has been the result of policies that were deliberately instituted sometime ago with a belief that they could control inflation. And we have just begun to apply the medicine. But Mr. Stockman has said that it'll be at least 1987 or through 1987 before the budget can be balanced. But at the same time there is this difference that with our tax cuts and the increase in savings, which has already begun, you know it does not take much more than a 1- or 2-percent increase in savings to add billions and billions of dollars to the capital pool. The person that either buys an insurance policy or puts the money in a bank, in a savings account that money is subsequently loaned, then, by the banks or the insurance companies, invested in industry, in growth, in mortgages, and so forth. And so, you have a pool of money that can probably handle the government borrowing as well as the rest. Those people who were advocating a tax increase as a method of trying to hold down the deficit and remember, it never has-in all the years past we have had nothing but tax increases and the deficits, and the deficits grew bigger. What is the difference whether the government has to borrow the money from the people and take it out of private circulation, or take it out of circulation by taxes? Either way, the people are without the money. Are you counting, ENTITY, on the people to use that 10 percent to put into IRA's and other protective securities, and not spend the money?

No, the Federal Government, I think, will be responsible for the standards, the basic standards. But the federalism program, which would be phased in over an 8-year period and this is one of the reasons I am out in the country right now we proposed a conceptual framework. That has to be fleshed out with specifics as to how it is going to operate. We are consulting with mayors, with Governors, with State legislators, with county executives all over the country for their help. Do you like it? And we are getting their input as to how we can phase these more than 40 programs over to State and local control a mandatory pass-through of those programs where the money should go on through to local governments, not just to the State level. And we believe that the savings will be tremendous, because trying to run these programs from the Federal level and the Federal Government is never equipped to do that; the Constitution even provides against it the Federal Government has tried to make rules and regulations that will fit Wyoming and Montana and Los Angeles and New York City, not recognizing the great diversity of this country.

No, we are going to take care of the people who really must be helped and who have real need.

But I would say that along about midyear and along about the spring, early summer, we are going to see a turn and an upward turn in the economy. Even though the budget has been projected into 1987 by Mr. Stockman, the deficit, that is, would not begin to show a recovery, the budget itself. Because Mr. Stockman and I and all the others in the administration, by law, are forced to project deficits out 5 years in advance. I will tell you now I do not believe anyone can. I do not believe in those. There are so many imponderables that we have complied with the law, but I will tell you that I did it knowing we do not know what we are talking about, nor does anyone else who tells you they are projecting deficits 5 years in advance. ENTITY, let us go back to your new federalism plan and how it is going to affect the States. As you obviously are aware, Minnesota is one of those States which does not enjoy a good financial picture right now. The legislature has recently patched up a 700-million-plus deficit. With the shift of government programs to the States, even with the trust fund, which you mentioned, it is going to have a strong and a heavy impact on States like Minnesota and the other north. We are going to transfer the funds that are necessary to perform the programs. And the trade that we proposed, of the Federal Government taking Medicaid and in return them taking food stamps and the Aid to Dependent Children, was because the increase, annual increase in spending on Medicaid is several times greater than the increase in those other programs. So, the Federal Government, by taking that program on, is going to relieve the States of an increased burden that will begin to be reflected in them having more of their own tax revenues as well as what we give them than they would have had, had they continued participating in Medicaid.

And now he has not made the SDI any condition with regard to that. There are some other things in that that are, well, that are going to cause us to negotiate that we hope can be eliminated. One, he is kind of made the French and the English an element, and we do not think that we are in a position to negotiate for somebody else. And also, the problem of the same kind of intermediate-range weapons being stationed east of the Urals, targeted on Asian targets.

Is the United States going to submit a counterproposal that will deal with the British and French question and the Asian question? Well, as a matter of fact, we have already, I think, made some proposals to them and have not had a response yet. The suggestion of that story was that Gorbachev seemed to be saying that he did not want to have a summit this year unless there was a prospect for a tangible agreement. What is your assessment of that? Is he trying to get out of a summit some way? I cannot believe that about him. He was so willing for it, and even then he made the proposal that we have one in '87 in his country, which we agreed to.

So, maybe he is just now confirming that he meant this all the time. But it is progress in our eyes. On the subject of Central America, can the democratic resistance in Nicaragua survive without military aid, in your view? From the government, I mean. I do not see how they could go on permanently without having some aid, particularly in the face of the extensive aid that they are getting from the Soviet Union and Cuba with regard to advanced weapons systems and so forth. They have got to be able to protect themselves. Some of your own allies in Congress say that it would be better to take the military aid question up or down rather than just let the freedom fighters wither on the vine with just nonlethal aid. Do you share that view, and are you going to go all out in this? I am going to go all out to try and get them the kind of aid that they must have. Most of the stories that I have read and estimates I have seen would indicate that it is going to take a very long time for the democratic resistance there to have any impact.

Now, right now, the budget we are asking for in defense for '87, that budget is below the projection that President Carter had made as to what the military budget would require in 1987. And we are below that level. We have made-over a 5-year period, the savings that we are making will result in $295 billion less than the bill would be if the things had not been done that Secretary Weinberger has done already. Can I ask one political question on another topic that you might-and that is - can we make this the last question? Is that-do we have-can we do that? Recently, your Vice President's come under fire, even from some of your most ardent supporters, for attacking Governor Cuomo-the way he did it.

I do not think it does rely that heavily on it. I think parents and educators would like to see some yardstick. So, we are talking about voluntary testing to show people where they stand. Is your school measuring up to this school over here? Is this school better in math and science than this school? So to reach our national education goals -- one of which is, incidentally, math and science proficiency -- I think we need a testing program. I do not think all the emphasis ought to be on testing, however. But are you requiring the testing? I think they can be flexible, but what they have got to do is show how a school compares with another one in this city or another State. And the idea that this kind of naive view that you do not need any testing, I think is ridiculous. I think we kind of went through that approach a while back, kind of a goo-goo approach that we do not need tests; we do not need anybody to know where they stand; we will just throw something out there at them. And I think you do need certain standards. One of the things I am excited about is trying to meet our national education standards -- first time we have ever had -- and it is not Republican or Democrat. And Ohio now is getting out in the forefront of all of this. You like the Ohio 2000 program? I think it is off to a good start. Governor Voinovich has put together what they call a Team of 100, and they come from all walks of life, and they come from different parties. And I think what he wants to do is get down into the communities to reinvent the school. I do not know, some teachers might wonder about what this does to the status quo, but most of them, I think, feel inhibited by a lot of bureaucracy and certification and regulations. And I think most recognize, no matter how hard they are trying, that we are not as competitive in education for the future as we should be.

There also is a lot of criticism that the Federal Government has too many regulations. For example, there is one program that if you buy computers under this program you cannot use those to teach disadvantaged students in the day and use it to teach adult literacy at night. Do you have any ideas on getting rid of some of these -- -- And I think a lot of the education 2000 strategy tries to address itself to that, fights against mandated programs from Washington, DC. A big argument that I have with many of the entrenched committee chairmen in Congress is, we have got to do it differently. Do not tell Columbus, Ohio that they have got to do a formula like you have just mentioned, the same as a formula from Brooklyn or Beeville, Texas. It is not that kind of -- it does not lend itself to this kind of rote or mandate. One, we have got to avoid legislative mandates. Secondly, if the Federal Government, just by rulemaking and regulation, is burdening these communities, then I have got to do better in getting rid of those regulations that just tie the hands of innovative superintendents or teachers or shopworkers or whatever it is. California had a very good idea when they started reform in that State, was that any school district could apply for an exemption if they found a rule or a law that roadblocked them, and they would handle that. There are exemptions that can be applied for to the departments in Washington, and I think we have been able to handle some by exemption. But the big answer is to redo it, to start from scratch. And therein, we may run into problems at local levels, State levels. But so far, the receptivity is strong in the 25 States, Ohio being the 25th, that have adopted the America 2000 education strategy. One of the things I did in preparation for this interview, ENTITY, was ask a number of teachers and principals, if you could ask the President any question, what would it be? What about funding? Obviously the bulk of funding for education comes from the States, but how are you going to pay for America 2000? Let me put funding in a broad perspective.

And our budget, of course, for the Department of Education is up. But I do not think that the Federal -- that the answer to education, if this is what Carol was saying, lies in vast increases in Federal funding. Federal funding is six percent, I believe, of the total education budget. She ought to look at how can we revolutionize this education to make ourselves be more efficient? How can we stop getting too many mandates telling me, Carol Price, how I ought to run my classroom, for example? I mean, in some areas I wish there was more money brought to bear on a specific problem. But I do not think we can say, well, we are failing because we are not getting enough money from the taxpayers. I think, she is operating on a day-to-day basis where she sees how much she has for supplies and how much she has to buy new textbooks and then the available Federal monies that she can get that -- that was her concern. Well, she may be right, because in this instance she may be speaking right there from the heart with fact on her side. Because in some areas, some States and some communities, as they assign priorities in tough economic times, have had to cut back on things. But I would be surprised if she is saying, Hey, they are not letting me get the diversity of classroom implements I need; Federal Government, please send it. And some of it is coming out of education. So maybe it is something like that, that motivated her comment. One of the goals of America 2000 is a skilled, literate workforce.

I do believe that the Federal Government has an obligation to do more to try to help California deal with the problems of illegal immigration. And I have worked hard on that, along with Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. We have almost doubled the border guards in southern California; we have increased our sending the illegal immigrants who have been convicted of crimes back home. We have given money to California for the very first time to deal with the costs of imprisonment. I have tried to get much more money for education and health care costs of immigration to California. But 187 operates primarily against children. It says, kick the children out of the health clinics. That could cause health problems for the general population. It says, kick the children out of the schools, which means teachers are turned into police officers. It means that the kids can be on the street causing problems for themselves and for others. We have already got too many children on the street. So I believe we have to do more. I found a big immigration mess when I became ENTITY 21 months ago. But this is not the answer, in my opinion, and I hope the voters will turn out and vote and reject 187. It is a way of dividing our people, it is clearly unconstitutional, and it is looking for easy answers to a tough problem. After all, some of the people that are for 187 are part of the problem. When Governor Wilson was Senator Wilson, he responded to the powerful forces in California that wanted more illegal immigrants in California to do work. He sponsored legislation to make it more difficult to remove illegal immigrants from the workplace by going easier on the employers. Now he, all of a sudden, has turned 180 degrees on this issue. But this is a complicated issue without a simple solution. I am committed to working with you to find a solution. I hope that our listeners, our viewers, will turn out and vote on Tuesday and vote against 187, and I hope they will come to the Kaiser Center in Oakland tomorrow where I am going to have a rally at 2 o'clock. if 187 is approved, do you think it will affect the NAFTA treaty with Mexico?

Social security-what I said to them was-and this was the basis of the plan that we submitted, but which was widely distorted in the debate that followed and I think for pure political demagoguery-that all the way through the campaign I cited the immediate problem of social security, of its running out of funds, and the long-range actuarial imbalance which is in the trillions of dollars, if you look on down the road, for those people who are just beginning their working years. What I pledged to do was to have a social security-to put it on a sound fiscal basis, and yet not at the expense of those people who are presently retired; that you pull the rug out From under them and reduce their benefits. The only thing that could be called a reduction in any way in the proposal we made, of those existing benefits, was we were going to try and get social security onto the fiscal year basis with regard to the cost-of-living adjustment. That would mean that for 1 year alone, they would go 15 months instead of 12 before their cost-of-living adjustment was computed. And that would, as we figured it out, average probably a $90 reduction of increase, not a reduction of existing benefits, reduction of their increase over their lifetime. The other things that we had suggested in that program were not aimed at deserving and eligible recipients. They were aimed at the abuses in the program, people that are collecting disability benefits and are not disabled.

This is the type of thing that we think there is much more of it than anyone realizes, as was evidenced in Chicago a couple of years ago with the-or a few years ago-with the welfare queen who went on trial. And it was found that in addition to collecting welfare under 123 different names, she also had 55 social security cards. So, this is where we were going to try and make some of the changes. What do you see as the Federal role with regard to California in terms of the Medfly, which is a terribly expensive battle, and also the vast number of refugees from Asia that have moved into, particularly, Los Angeles? What do you see as the role there to perform? Well, we have been dealing with a reform of the immigration laws on all of this, except that with regard to the refugees-people who are fleeing persecution and who, if they were made to return to their own country, would probably face death or imprisonment-I think that our traditions-there is no way that we can abandon those traditions or the words that are on the base of the Statue of Liberty. And we have a particular problem, I know, with our neighbor to the South. But we think that this program is going to meet our needs and the needs of the refugees coming in, so that we will not be abandoning that. We are also looking at how we can handle these and probably a fairer distribution in our country. I know, in 1980-the administration then was caught by the great exodus from Cuba in addition to the Haitian overflow and so forth. No planning had been made for that. We are also looking at available sites and facilities for a detention center for those who are apprehended and are illegal aliens, who will probably be returned. ENTITY, one of the potential detention centers that you are considering is in northern New York, where I am from, where the climate is about as different as you can get from the Haitian climate and still be in the country.

This recession-remember that when we came here, January 20th, we had a great unemployment problem, severe in several areas far more than in others. It is easy to look at, say, an 8 percent inflation rate and think of that as the nation as a whole. We have States, and some of you are probably from those States, where inflation is approaching the 20 percent mark. That is like the Great Depression of the thirties, due to the particular industries that have been affected-in addition to construction, the steel industry, automobiles, and so forth. We think that the best thing that we can do is to go forward with this plan, which we think is going to stimulate the economy. I think we are due, for several months yet, of hard times, but I think that in '82 we are going to see-later in the year-a change in the situation. The falling interest rates indicate that-the inflation rates that I mentioned-so that I think the safety net is still there for those people of real need.

{"id": 1902, "text": "Let me just say one thing about that particular problem. I was as surprised as anyone when suddenly the announcement was made that in a month we have increased the unemployed by 500,000. Now, as you know, there is no accurate way of counting the unemployed. There is an accurate way of counting the people who are in the work force. And it is difficult for me to understand this sudden surge of unemployment when, at the same time, there are 266,000 more people employed in the work force than there were on January 20th, when this administration started. I cannot believe that we have suddenly added three-quarters of a million people to our population. But let me point out one reason why there could be some fluctuations. First of all, any unemployed, other than those who are voluntarily between jobs, is too much. So, I do not want to sound callous about that. As a matter of fact, there is nothing that is harder for me to do than to think of putting somebody out of a job. I came into the work force myself in the depths of the Great Depression. I saw what took place there. But unemployment is determined by some 60-odd thousand telephone calls, like a Nielsen rating on a TV show, throughout the country-random. And the question is, Is anyone in the household looking for work? And on the basis of these calls and the percentage, the percentage of unemployed is determined. Suppose it is a housewife who says to you on the phone, Well, you know, the children are getting along now and if I could find something that did not interfere with family and was right, yes. Well, the person can put that down as she is looking for work, or the person from this end of the phone can put that down as no. Nor are we dividing between all those teenagers, that on the other end of the phone someone might answer and say, Well, my son would love to have an after-school job if he could find one, and so you can put him down unemployed. The millions of unemployed are not, all of them, heads of household, leading a family without earnings. Maybe I am overly suspicious, but I keep remembering that when I was Governor of California, they decided to do some changing in counting the unemployed, here in Washington.

So, I have been a little worried here that sometimes we-and I do not mean to do any less about trying to get them the work, we are going to-but I think that our program is aimed at that. I am aware that-I know somebody is waiting to tell me I have to leave- -but I am also aware that when Kennedy had his across-the-board tax cuts, aimed at the same thing, to stimulate the economy, and the same economists and many of the same voices were raised, advising against it and saying that was absolutely the wrong thing to do, he persisted. And immediately thereafter the rate of savings, personal savings in the country-the percentage went up from 2.9 percent of the earnings in the country to 8 percent. The rate of increase in employment-not unemployment, in employment-doubled. The percentage of the gross national product or, I mean, the gross national product increased sizably, and the government's revenues increased at the lower rate of taxation. Now, one of the economists who has previously, and all these past months, been opposed to our proposal, Walter Heller, a very distinguished economist, when the recession was announced a short time ago, Walter Heller said how lucky we were that our tax reduction was just going into effect and that that just turned out to be exactly the right medicine for a recession. Well, if it is the right medicine to maybe help cure the recession, why would not it have been good medicine to have prevented the recession? If we, taking those personal savings-if we could increase by 2 percentage points the rate of savings in this country, through these tax cuts, that adds $40 billion to the capital pool that is available for investment and for people for mortgages and so forth. And incidentally, since the construction industry is one of the hard hit things right now in this recession, we have taken action-and I maybe sticking- ENTITY. I do not want to be one of the White House leaks. This morning we had a group from the construction industry in, and we have-over in the Labor Department-made some definite changes in regulations.

You know, part of the lull in housing construction right now is the lowering of interest rates. The slump was caused by the high interest rates, but when the high interest rates start down, there is a lull while everybody says, Well, let us wait till they get lower. Maybe we can, with this new decision, maybe we can increase the speed with which those rates come down.

Listen- we just had a meeting yesterday of our national task force. That is exactly what they are set up to do-is to not only spread the word of where volunteer efforts have been tried someplace and are working successfully, and then spread that so that other people can do it, but also to answer that question of the many people who are trying to volunteer. There is an estimated $100 billion worth of time and effort right now being contributed in this country in work in voluntary causes, in addition to $47 billion in actual cash contributed in volunteer efforts.

I think what the Palestinians want is a peace process that gives them a stronger sense of self-determination and possibility and dignity.

We have to work with the Palestinians tomorrow, then we have to analyze where we are with both and whether we can go forward. And we may not make any progress at all. And if we do not , I will tell you that. I'd like to ask you, though, after spending so much time with Mr. Netanyahu on this visit and on other visits, some people regard him as a man who always opposed a land for peace settlement to the conflict with the Palestinians, certainly would not have negotiated the Oslo accords had he been in office then, has never liked them particularly. Some would say he is really trying to thwart that process and contain the damage from his standpoint. No, I cannot say that based on what I have seen. I do believe he is made no secret of the fact that he has principle differences with the Oslo process, which he has pledged to support. And we all know he has a different political coalition, and that indeed, the political forces in Israel itself are different than they were even a few years ago in terms of the composition of the population, the rise of these small parties and immigrant-related intense groups and all that. I think that, historically, there is been a little bit of difference in the kind of the texture of the relationship between the Likud Party and the Palestinians and the Labor Party and the Palestinians. But the bottom line is, I think, Mr. Netanyahu is an intelligent man who wants to make peace and understands that there has to be some formula where some marginal increase in territorial insecurity by giving up land is more than offset by a dramatic increase in security by changing the feelings of the people, the climate, the capacity for growth and opportunity.

So now he says that he is going to determine that, and there is not going to be any when for a couple of months, during which time he will be free to move whatever he wants wherever he wants. I think that this is a big mistake, and I believe that the United Nations will see it as such, and a real thwarting of its position.

The main thing is every country in the region and throughout the world has a vested interest in seeing that no one who would either use or sell weapons of mass destruction especially chemical and biological weapons which could be carried around in small amounts, in little valises that no one who would use or sell them has a big program of them, which is why the whole United Nations is against the Iraqi program.

Federal prosecutors reportedly rejected a plea bargain agreement not long ago with Theodore Kaczynski, with his lawyers at least, that might have guaranteed his imprisonment for life. Evidently they want the death penalty. Is it important to you, say, if he is convicted, that there be an exercise of the Federal death penalty? If he is guilty, he killed a lot of people deliberately, and, therefore, I think it is something that the jury should be able to consider. From my point of view, I approve of the laws that we have in America now, the sort of two-tiered trial where you determine guilt and then you determine penalty, and I would want to hear all the testimony before I decided how I'd vote in that case. But I do think it should be presented to the penalty phase. Even if you had a guilty plea that as there is no parole in the Federal system guaranteed none and spared any possibility of an acquittal, you would still prefer to reject that plea, to offer the jury the option of the death penalty? I think the jury should have the option. Now, also, as a practical matter, there are not many inmates perhaps he would be one that actually do get life without parole. That is, in a prison system, where you do not want prison riots, you have to reward people who do an extraordinarily good job of being good inmates within the prison system, perhaps the practice of allowing people who have life sentences to be paroled after quite a long period of time is a good one, or, at least, defensible.

But if we refuse on the front end to do anything, the problem is it could hurt us a lot worse than it could hurt the odd banker that does not get his money back, because if a lot of people start not getting any of their money back, then other people say, Well, I am going to get my money out, and then others say, Well, I am not going to put my money in ; and then all of a sudden the value of the currency goes way down. They do not have any money to buy American products and all their products are cheaper, competing against ours and other countries. So we have a big economic interest as well as a huge interest in a stable, democratic Asia. And that is why I think we are doing the right thing. I hope in the State of the Union I can persuade the American people that it is the right thing. I want to ask you about Clintonism. We have been hearing a lot about Clintonism lately, a coherent political philosophy that may or may not be identified with you. I think, first of all, it is a very it is a future-oriented political philosophy that attempts to break the logjam between the 1980's and early nineties debate of the Republican position that Government is the enemy and the Democratic position is, sort of, Government is the solution if we do more of the same; we just need to do more. My position is we need a different kind of Government for a different kind of society and a different kind of world. And we need to focus more on giving people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives, more on being a catalyst for good ideas, more on empowering the disadvantaged, and creating opportunity, enforcing responsibility, building community. I think that is what Clintonism is about. And I think it will get us to the 21st century.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmaraliassonandrobertsiegelnationalpublicradio", "title": "Interview With Mara Liasson and Robert Siegel of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mara-liasson-and-robert-siegel-national-public-radio", "publication_date": "21-01-1998", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, two-thirds of the American people say that we are either in a recession or headed toward a recession. Why the angst and why cannot your administration take get any of the credit for this good news? Well, we certainly try to explain to the American people that there are some that there is good news. There is been 49 consecutive months of job growth, which is the longest stretch in the history of the country. The budget deficit's down to 1.2 percent of GDP, which is extremely low. A couple of factors, I think, trouble Americans. One is that there is a lot of churning in the job market. In other words, if you are under 30, you are likely to have had seven jobs by the time you are 30. And older people like me take a look at that kind of volatility or some would call it excitement in the job market, and they wonder whether or not this job turnover is going to affect them. People want to know whether or not, one, the government's going to stay out of their business, and two, whether or not this is going to be good policy that'll enable them to have affordable and available health care. People are concerned about their pensions to a certain extent. There is still you know, we have transitioned from defined contribution or defined benefit to a defined contribution plan. And yet there are still some who are involved with defined, you know, benefits. So there is a variety of reasons why people are uncertain. But people, when they take a hard look at the statistics and the reality, they ought to, you know, I hope it brings them some comfort to know this economy is strong and it is setting all kinds of records. Speaking of the benefits, what did you think of the UAW's deal with GM, Chrysler also working on a deal? Should this be a blueprint for other industries? Well, from my perspective, I am glad they were able to settle the deal in an expeditious way.

It seems you cannot even control the Republicans in Congress. And what do you say to those people who are trying to put trade barriers in place? Well, I have long worried about protectionism and isolationism here in America. We have had periods of protectionism in our past and I am concerned about protectionist sentiment, because I believe that a world that welcomes US products and goods and services is beneficial for American farmers and manufacturers. In other words, if there is more customers for what we produce here in America, the better off the producers will be. It is also good for consumers that we have open markets. In other words, the more options the consumer has, the less inflationary our society can be. And I think it is good when consumers are able to have a variety of choices. And so I it is going to be very important for me to continue to explain the positive side of trade. In other words, people are getting work. There is a lot of people whose jobs depend upon exportation of goods and services. There are people whose jobs benefitted as a result of foreign capital coming into the country. I think about some of the automobile manufacturers in the South. But I understand why people are anxious about trade. People are saying, 'I may lose my job, or somebody else is going to get my job because of free trade.' And what is very important for people like me who believe in markets is one, to explain the economic benefits, but also to assure people that there is trade adjustment programs to help people retrain for better jobs that have got stability. Let me switch to housing. We have had a meltdown in housing. Oh, first of all, there is a lot of people who can afford the houses that they live in and they are going to be fine There is no question there are particularly some people on the margin that are going to have to that are defaulted on their loans, and that troubles me.

What happened, it seems like to me in the housing, again, I am not an expert, but there was a lot of incentive for people to, you know, buy homes. And so we had a huge supply of homes. And until the supply and demand gets back in balance, you are going to see some softness. There is not a nationwide phenomenon, there are parts of our country that are doing just fine in their real estate markets. And you know, we are paying close attention to it and we are going to make sure that government policy is not counterproductive but consumers can be helped to stay in their homes, for example, through FHA reform. So were the rate cuts enough or would you think to encourage more? Well, I knew you would try to suck me into the dialogue of monetary policy but you know full well that the Federal Reserve is independent from the president. I never send Ben Bernanke instructions, he does not expect me to send him instructions, nor do I publicly comment on what I would like to see done or monetary policy. I can talk about fiscal policy all day long and that is we will keep taxes low and make sure Congress does not overspend the people's money. Let us talk about that in particular, the health care coverage. You vetoed a plan last week to expand health care coverage for millions of low income children. First of all, the Democrats are misleading people when they say this is a plan to expand health care to millions of low income children. The plan that I vetoed would have expanded health care coverage to families making up to 80 something thousand dollars, in some cases. And which would have meant people would have been moving from private insurance to public care. I do support a program that helps poor children. But the program that I vetoed expanded health care, government health care. By the way, just so you know some of the facts I think will interest you. About a half million poor children under the program as it exists today do not get coverage.

So my call to Congress was it you are truly for poor children, like I am, let us make sure the program answers that need, and let us not expand the federal role in health care. See, I believe that for some members, this was an important step toward the federalization of health care. Really fine people believe that the best health care policy is when the federal government runs it. I believe the best health care policy is to take care of those who cannot help themselves, like poor children, and encouraged those in the private sector. I am for private medicine. I want decisions to be being made between doctor and patient, not between people here in Washington, DC. And so the I am vetoing the bill, working hard to see that it is not overridden, the veto's sustained, and then I will be willing to work with the Democrats to focus the program on poor children. One Democrat and I do admit this was a Democrat, say look, all of a sudden you found fiscal discipline now and you veto this, but how come you signed the Farm Bill, you signed the Highway Bill and others, passed by Republican Congresses that substantially exceeded your initial target? Well, I would remind that person that over the course of my presidency, we have been able to reduce the federal deficit substantially. As I told you, it is down to 1.2 percent of GDP, which is historically low, very low. And I was able to do so working with the Congress, and at the same time, fight a war and make sure our kids had the support and troops equipment they needed. In other words, the fiscal policy of low taxes and setting fiscal priorities here in Washington has worked. And we are on our way to balancing this budget and it is going to be very important for Congress not to overspend nor raise taxes. What do you think of Senator Clinton's idea, the kid bond idea? It sounds similar, actually, to your idea of private accounts with Social Security.

I am not going to interject myself into the presidential campaign yet. You have more than a year left in your second term. What are your goals for the economy for the rest of your service here? Well, first is to keep taxes down and keep, you know, and to have good, wise fiscal policy. To work with Congress and say, 'Look, let us set priorities and meet those priorities,' and be willing to use the veto if they want to overspend, which the initial blush looks like they are going to try to do. One of the reasons why our third quarter growth was good was because of exports. In other words, when we export it means growth in our economy. Continue to work on energy policy that makes us less dependent on foreign sources of energy. And so I have got an important agenda that and win the war on terror and protect the homeland. By the way, one of the best economic measures we can do is make sure we do not get attacked again. As you know, the attacks of September the 11th crippled our economy for a short period of time. I would not say cripple's not the right word damaged our economy for a short period of time. And you know, and we will keep working night and day to make sure we protect the American people. So is Social Security off the table at this point or will you try to fix it in the remaining time? You know, I'd like to, but remember, I am the person that has laid this issue out in my State of the Union address and talked specifically about how to address Social Security. Whether or not Congress has got the will to step up and try to get something done, I do not know. I'd like very much for people of both parties to come in and say, 'You know, you gave us a good starting point, you gave us a good idea. Because Social Security and Medicare, the unfunded liabilities inherent in those programs, are two of the most significant fiscal challenges this country faces.

Let me ask you about oil, ENTITY. Why is it that we really have not seen a substantial energy plan? We all know that we have to be reliant on foreign oil, but should there me more incentives for hybrids, perhaps a gasoline tax, something? I think we have had a significant energy bill pass that is comprehensive in nature, that couples good conservation policy with diversification away from oil. One of the things that has taken place in our country that does not get much notice is the advent of ethanol. Right now, ethanol is mainly created through the use of corn. And we have a billion gallons of ethanol to eight billion gallons of ethanol on an annual basis, and we are spending a fair amount of taxpayers' money on research and development on cellulosic ethanol, which is a fancy word for using like wood chips to make ethanol or corn or stalks or switchgrass. The whole purpose is to incent people to develop the technologies that will enable us to get off of oil. You cannot get off oil overnight but you can diversify away from oil over time, and that is precisely what we are doing now in the most substantial ways of any administration in history. Secondly, we have got to figure out new ways to produce electricity.

So it sounds like you are saying Vladimir Putin is trying to provoke a civil war. Well, what I am saying is that the Russians generally have not been respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The question now becomes whether or not this can be deescalated and resolved in a way that gives Ukrainians a chance to make their own decisions about their own lives. What I have said consistently is that each time Russia takes these kinds of steps that are designed to destabilize Ukraine and violate their sovereignty, that there are going to be consequences. Putin's decisions are not just bad for Ukraine. Over the long term, they are going to be bad for Russia. Now, we want to give diplomacy a chance as long as ultimately the decisions are being made by Ukrainians not by Russians, not by Americans, not by other European nations, but by Ukrainians themselves.

I have to tell you that everybody around the world understands the superiority of our military. And as commander in chief, I do not make decisions based on perceived signals. We make decisions very deliberately based on what is required for our security and for the security of our allies. The Russians understand that.

You know, they will send it back and people are going to go and make 200 suggestions as opposed to maybe no suggestions because it is a great bill. Every once in a while there is a method under which, you know, it could be that some people in the middle class will not benefit as much as we want them to benefit and we are making certain adjustments but I think we are going to have it sooner rather than later. Paul Ryan did an interview this week and said you are insisting that they have a fourth bracket. It is on your insistence that they have a fourth bracket. I know that you are very focused on the middle class but do you want to raise taxes on the rich with the fourth bracket? Well, he really said that on the basis that I wanted it or was thinking about it because I want to make sure the middle class gets taken care of. So, in that way, yes, but actually we do have four brackets because we have a zero bracket and people are not including that. So, that would actually make it a fifth bracket as opposed to an eight bracket on the other side, on the other way. I call that our competition which is the competition from the past. No, I think that when Paul says that we may not have that. I would rather do that than do anything to hurt the middle class. But, see, that is what I do not understand and I followed your policies really closely. The state and local income tax deduction eliminations you take that away and then you go to a fifth bracket or a fourth bracket however you want to say it and you get a higher rate for their top earners. If the top earners pay 80 percent of the taxes why are you so afraid to cut taxes on the top earners? I think this, look, you know, I am very happy with the way I have done part of this in my civilian life, all right. Other people well it is about me representing rich people. Very interesting to me Bob Kraft was down. He owns the Patriots. He gave me a Super Bowl ring a month ago. Which was very nice.

And, I have had many people, very wealthy people tell me the very same thing. I have had very few say I want more, I want more. They really want to see you know the middle class has really not done very well over the last long period of time. And, so when Paul mentions maybe one more category which I'd rather not have, it may not happen. But the only reason I would have and he does say this, he is very plain on what he said is that if for any reason that the other middle class is not being properly taken care of. So, that is a big factor but we have so many things that are going to be so great And, we have a lot of most important but bringing it down from 35 down to 20 percent that is a massive that' the biggest that we have ever done. It is a big deal in the corporate rate for sure. That is a big deal for companies; that is a big deal for investment. I think one of the other ones is expensing, you know when you write something off in one year as opposed to you know over many years, I think that is going to be tremendous. We have so many things in this plan that are going to be for growth and you know your next questions going to be deficit so and on, and I fully understand that we all understand it, and growth, if we pick up one point on GDP that is $2.5 trillion if you think of. Two point five it more than pays for everything and I think we pick up much more than 1 point, and I have been the one that is saying we are going to hit 3 sooner later than later, in the last quarter we 3.2. We have not been there real we have not been there in a long time, it is been a long time. As you know the previous administration did not hit it for the year for 8 years. In 8 years it did not hit it at all. Here we hit it you know an early quarter for me, and actually before that it was down in the ones, it was down in the ones.

And I am saying you know we had it a 1% so I really think we can do much more than a let us see what happens, but 1 point is 2.5 trillion and millions of jobs. Let me ask about your courting of the Democrats recently I mean the reason that I brought up this other bracket is because I feel like the Republicans get bullied by the left, by this whole talking point of it is always tax cuts for the rich. By the way that is an automatic talking point. I mean for sure I get along with Schumer - I do not think so it does not seem like it we got the budget passed. I you get a fifth bracket, are you getting bullied? So here is the thing Schumer, I like Schumer, but before he even knows the plan he will say Oh this is for the rich so he does not even know what the plan is, and he is screaming it for the rich. He did it with healthcare too, he said This is for the rich, this is for the rich you are not going to get your coverage. Everybody is going to go into hospitals; that is going to be terrible, the world is coming to an end, OK. That is OK you know we are all learning politics right, and he said that well, he says the same thing because I saw him two days ago before he really knew what was happening, he said Oh no it is for the rich. So it is an automatic statement, it is like in business you ask for twice as much I mean. Right, well you go back with Chuck Schumer. You know I have always gotten along with him. Is this helpful in terms of negotiations? I do not think it matters, I mean I really do not , but I met with the Senate Finance Committee, I met with the Republicans, Democrats together right across the hallway two days ago we had a great meeting.

Well, and and by the way I have just begun because Well, there is a lot more I mean really lot more, I mean I think I can double it before it is over, but a lot of it is statutory where you have to give a 90 day notice and then you have give 120 day, we have given those notices I mean we are going to be doing a lot more. see I think that is why we have had a 3.1 percent GDP.

As you know, we started back in the fall saying we cannot wait. And so helping families refinance their homes, we went ahead and did it administratively. Some of the changes that we are making on immigration, we are trying to make sure that we are prioritizing criminals. That the three in 10 program is something that we can change administratively so that families are not separated so long, when they have the opportunity to apply for citizenship. There are things that we are doing with community colleges, and on education that we can do administratively. But ultimately, we can obviously do a lot more if Congress is willing to move. There is no doubt that when it comes to jobs, our biggest priority is manufacturing. We are here at this Intel plant that is going to provide 1,000 jobs here in Arizona. And thousands of construction jobs building this facility. And companies like Intel are not unique. What they are finding is they can be competitive here in the United States, but we have got to change our tax codes in order to provide even more incentives to invest in the United States. When it comes to American energy. There are a lot of things that we can do administratively, for example, natural gas. We think that we are going to be looking at 600,000 jobs in natural gas extraction here in the United States and all the industries that come with it. But we could be doing more if we are investing in clean energy. So on each of these areas, making sure that we are building the skills of American workers, making sure that we are encouraging American manufacturing. Making sure that we have got a strong American energy program. That we can do some things administratively, but ultimately Congress, which has the power of the purse, is going to have to act as well. Unemployment is about 11 percent among Latinos, much higher than the national average. What can you say to Latinos? And what can you do for Latinos who are looking for jobs?

One of them is all the construction workers who were laid off.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmariaelenasalinasunivision", "title": "Interview with Maria Elena Salinas of Univision", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-maria-elena-salinas-univision", "publication_date": "25-01-2012", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 1936, "text": "Latinos were highly represented in the construction trade, and when the housing bubble went bust a lot of people got laid off. That is one of the reasons why we are going to continue to encourage refinancing, and we are actually expanding the refinancing program that we talked about a few months ago so that it can reach more people. And that should help shore up the housing market. And that could help create jobs. But we are also going to make sure that we try to push Congress to fund infrastructure projects that put a lot of construction workers back to work all across the country. Latinos are just unfortunately represented when it comes to small businesses. And so one of the things that we want to do is to continue to get more effective financing programs to small businesses and startups, because they create most of the jobs here in the United States. So everything that we do is designed to help America as a whole grow, but there are certain industries that have been badly affected because of the housing crisis. Latinos have been badly affected by them. If we can start helping those areas, then that is going to give a big boost. You spoke a lot about fairness in your speech. You mentioned the importance or the need for all to pay their fair share. Governor Romney we know that recently said that he is paid only 13.9 percent on 46 million income. Does he represent the inequities in our tax system? Well, I will let Governor Romney speak to his own taxes. What I know is that as a general rule, those who are making the most in the top one percent or in the top one-tenth of one percent often times pay lower tax rates than their secretaries, or their drivers, or the people who are working in their homes. Now what makes it especially important is because right now we have got a big deficit. And we are all debating how do we reduce the government debt and the deficit, so we have a stable fiscal environment. We cannot reduce the deficit if people like me or anybody else who is making a lot of money are in a position where they are paying the lowest rate in taxes in 50 years, even lower than they were under Ronald Reagan, lower than they were under Bill Clinton. It is not good for the economy. It is not good for our deficit. And ultimately what we do not want to do is to cut more programs for higher education or cut more programs in basic science and research that create these tremendous innovations like you see here in Intel.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmariaelenasalinasunivision", "title": "Interview with Maria Elena Salinas of Univision", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-maria-elena-salinas-univision", "publication_date": "25-01-2012", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 1937, "text": "If instead we could be making those investments, also closing our deficit by making sure that everybody is paying their fair share. Well, you have been strongly criticized by Republican contenders. For example, Romney says, that you are you failed America. And Newt Gingrich told Univision today that your presidency is littered with broken promises. He challenged you to three or seven three-hour debates. When are you going to respond to them? Well, I will let them determine who their standard bear is going to be. Until the Republicans have a nominee, we do not have a campaign. Right now they have to decide who it is that they want representing them. Who will be a more challenging contender for you? You know, I do not really think about that. What I can say is this. That whoever their nominee is, they represent ideas that I think are wrong for America. They believe that we should not provide a pathway to citizenship for young people who were brought here when they were very young children, and are basically American kids, but right now are still in a shadow. They have said that they would veto the Dream Act. They both believe that we should repeal a healthcare law that stands to provide millions of Latinos who work every single day the opportunity to make sure that they have got health insurance. And so on a whole range of issues I think that whether it is Mr. Romney or Mr. Gingrich or Mr. Santorum or whoever else they might decide to select, they represent a fundamentally different vision of America. And it is not the bold generous forward looking optimistic America that I think built this country. Republicans are also criticizing you saying that you are campaigning instead of governing. Now as an incumbent, you have the right to campaign for your re-election. But how will people be able to differentiate between your campaigning and your governing? Well, you know, the truth of the matter is, is that I think a lot of commentators have said that I spent most of my first three years not doing a lot of politics, 'cause we were so busy with policy. And you know, my general instinct is to focus on doing my job because my attitude is, if I am doing my job well, people will recognize it, and the politics will follow. Obviously right now we are having a big debate in the country as a whole about the direction that we are going in.

You know, there were politics involved in that debate. But politics in the sense of how we are determining what is best for our country. And so I cannot really separate these debates. What I am trying to do is persuade as many members of Congress as possible, as well as the American people, that we are making progress. We have created three million jobs in the last 22 months. We have seen a recovery in manufacturing. And probably the best manufacturing hiring that we have seen since the 1990's. We are moving in the right direction. What we cannot do is go back to the same policies that got us into this mess in the first place. It also means by the way that when I am out on, you know, in Arizona or other states I am going to be arguing about issues like regulation. One of the things that we have been talking about is the reason we had this housing crisis was because we did not have strong regulations in place. And people were subject to predatory lending. They were fooled into buying homes that they could not afford. And so we have had to, for example, appoint Richard Cordray as the head of the Consumer Protection Bureau that we have setup. And I want to build a case as to why that is important. Because for Latino families it is very important to make sure that they are not cheated when they are purchasing a home. It is very important that when they send remittances to Mexico that somebody is not taking too much of their hard-earned paychecks. So those are the kinds of fights that we are going to have. And you know, some people may interpret that as campaigning. I consider that to be important to my leadership in governing this country. Talking about Latino families there is a new Univision/ABC /Latino Decisions poll that has good and bad news for you. Hispanics continue to support you. Fifty-three percent they are less excited about your performance. In part, because they feel that you did not keep your promise for immigration reform. Can you explain to them why?

Obviously in the State of Union yesterday, I could not have been clearer about not only my interest in comprehensive immigration reform, but if we cannot do the whole package, at minimum let us get the Dream Act done. But we now have two Republican candidates who said they'd veto a Dream Act. And you know, that kind of lack of responsiveness to the very real stories that are out there of families who work hard, who are contributing to our society, young people who should be our next engineers here at Intel or next teachers in our schools, are not able to access the kind of opportunity that I think everybody feels they should. So this is the kind of barrier that we are meeting in Congress. We are just going to keep on pushing and pushing until hopefully we finally get a break. But ENTITY, one of the concerns is the deportations. Over 1.2 million people have been deported under your administration. You could not do anything administratively for this? Well, there are some things that we are doing. Now first of all, the fact is Congress allocates this money. Whoever was president, you were going to see some increase in terms of enforcement. But, but, well, because that is the law that is on the books right now. And the way our system works, the president does not have the authority to simply ignore Congress and say, we are not going to enforce the laws that you have passed. What we do have the ability to do, and what we have systematically done, is to use our administrative authority to prioritize and say, let us not focus on Dream Act kids. Let us not focus on a law-abiding family that is out there trying to, you know, make their way. Let us focus on folks who are engaged in criminal activity. Let us focus on those that are breaking laws not just immigration laws. And in fact you have seen a steady increase in the percentage of those who are deported who have committed crimes. Now I cannot , again, just wave away the laws the Congress has put in place. But what we have tried to do is to, you know, create a system that is more humane, that is better prioritized.

After a Univision documentary showed that she was participating in some kind of cyber espionage against the U.S. Were you involved in the decision making? You know, I will not go into the details of this. Obviously there were investigations and follow-up that took place. My wish is that we could see improved relations with Venezuela. We do not desire ruptured relations with any country. But you know, we are going to continue to try to pursue a diplomatic path in Latin America that upholds the values that we care about. Democracy, you know, respect for human rights, respect for freedom of the press, making sure that no country is interfering with, you know, the legitimate claims of their neighbors. And so you know, that is going to create some tensions with Venezuela. But you know, there are tensions that we can manage. Is the growing influence of Iran in Latin America including Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, does that concern you? You know, I think Iran is an example of a country that has become more and more isolated because of its own actions. Obviously it is trying to reach out to some countries in Latin America. But overall Iran has never been more isolated, because they are pursuing nuclear weapons that violate international law. And I think the world community recognizes that the last thing we need is an arms race in the Middle East. What we have done is organized international sanctions. We have worked collectively with other countries to try to put pressure on Iran. But we have also said, you have a path to reintegrate with the world community. You can pursue peaceful nuclear power, forego nuclear weapons, and the international community I think will accept you. But so far at least they have not been willing to take that path. And we are going to be relentless in continuing to apply pressure on them until they make a better choice. We have run out of time. By any chance have you been practicing your Spanish?

Gabby Giffords in a very emotional plea in the Senate hearing today on gun control said now is the time. Can Congress tackle both issues at the same time? And which one will have priority? Well, there is no doubt that Congress can tackle both. We have to get comprehensive immigration reform. It is been too long since we reformed the system. And we are starting to see a bipartisan consensus built around this. So we need to take the opportunity and we need to do it fast. As the Senators do their work, start identifying where there is some differences. We can provide some technical assistance. Will one be easier than the other? Well, my suspicion is we are seeing more bipartisan discussion on the immigration issue, than on the gun issue. But I also think that on the gun issue you are starting to see the gun owners, people who traditionally opposed gun control saying you know what, when 20 of our children are shot by somebody whose disturbed, and when it is that easy to get these high clip magazines that can fire off hundreds of shots in a few minutes, that it is time for us to do a better job on background checks. Both will end up generating some opposition and some strong opposition. But I am generally encouraged that the Senate seems to be having a serious conversation about these issues. You said in your speech that if Congress does not work in a timely manner on immigration reform you will send your own bill. And you will ask them to, in your own words, to vote on it right away. What to you is a timely manner? The Senate is supposed to introduce legislation by March. Well, you know if they can get a piece of legislation debated on the floor by March I think that is a good timeline. Keep in mind that most of these issues we have done work on already. We have a pretty good sense of the work we have already done on border security. We already know what would be required to earn a legal status and citizenship in terms of paying a fine and learning English. And going through background checks and paying back taxes. So a lot of this work has been done. So we have already drafted a bill.

I am not going to lay down a particular date because I want to give them a little bit of room to debate. Will we have immigration reform by the end of this year? You can tell our audience si se puede! But I want to remind the audience, because Maria Elena we have had this conversation for many, many years. The only way this is going to get done is if the Republicans continue to work with Democrats in Congress in both chambers in order to get a bill to my desk. I was very pleased to see the Senators from both the Democratic side and the Republican side come together and put forth principles. Now they have got to fill in the details. Look, it is not that we do not know how to do this. It is not that we got technical problems. This is a matter of, as I said in my speech yesterday, us recognizing that comprehensive immigration reform will make our economy stronger. It is true to our traditions. It speaks to our future. It makes sure that young people who are here like the DREAMERs who want to contribute and want to join our military, want to start a business, that they have opportunities. And, you know, if we keep that positive mindset understanding that that is a strength of America that we attract talent from all around the world, then I am confident that we can get it done. Most people believe that the biggest hurdle will be the path to citizenship. You have clearly said that it mustn't be included from the outset. Senator Marco Rubio says that he will not support a bill that does not put border security ahead of citizenship. Is this going to end up being a battle between you and Marco Rubio? Look, we put border security ahead of pathway to citizenship. We have done more on border security in the last four years than we have done in the previous 20. We have seen a drop in terms of illegal crossings of about 80 percent since 2000. We have made enormous strides, put resources in, we have actually done almost everything that Republicans asked to be done several years ago as a condition to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform.

We want to make sure that we are very clear that this legislation provides a real pathway. Now that pathway will take some time. That even under our proposal, this is not a situation where overnight suddenly people all find themselves as citizens. They are going to have to earn their way to it. And they are going to have to go to the back of the line. We are going to have to clear out the, you know, existing lines, the backlog that we have in terms of legal immigrants. Because they did it the right way. We should not punish them for not breaking the law. So all those things are going to have to be put in place. But we have to put that in the place at the outset and make sure that people are clear that this pathway is real and not just a fantasy for the future.

Millions of people are desperate to hear from you. They want answers. People who voted for you and people who are confident that this year, this time around you will definitely keep your promise. But the most commonly asked question is, for example, one from Jonathan made on Facebook. Under your plan what would happen to those who already have deportation letters. Also, would parents of U.S. born children who have been deported be able to come back under your plan? Well, what I am going to do is allow the Senate to work on these details. I do not want to, you know, fill in all the blanks. Because otherwise I would have gone ahead and put a bill forward. And then sometimes that creates a dynamic in Congress where if I am for it, then maybe some people have to be against it. I think that over the next several weeks, these next several months what we will see is many of these issues will be debated. But the basic principle would be, from my perspective, that somebody who has lived here has been overall a good neighbor has been somebody who is been law abiding other than the fact that they came here illegally.

Now I know that you have reduced, this is another concern on Twitter, the number of deportations of non-criminals. However, in 2012 more than 184,000 non-criminals were deported. In the spirit of your push for immigration reform, would you consider a moratorium on deportations of non-criminals? This is not about policy. It is about people. Well, I think it is important to remind everybody that, as I said I think previously, and I am not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I am required to follow the law. And that is what we have done. But what I have also said is, let us make sure that we are applying the law in a way that takes into account people's humanity. That is the reason that we moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law we said, we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law. The same is true with respect to the kinds of the length of time that people have to spend outside of the country when their spouses are already here for example. So we are making some changes there. With respect to deportations until we get comprehensive immigration reform. That is one of the reasons I think it is so important for us to go ahead and get this action done. And keep in mind that if we are able to say, at the end of this year, or maybe even before the end of the summer, that we have gotten comprehensive immigration reform done, then that then empowers me to deal with many of these issues in a way that I think, to allow the more specific issues that a lot of people I think would like to see resolved. If you had to choose, what would be the concessions that you would be willing to make on immigration reform? And what would be completely unacceptable to you?

One of my highest priorities as an administration, particularly in my second term, because now I am thinking about legacy, is to make sure that we are identifying talent from every walk of life, from every ethnic group, so that the next President will see how big a pool there is of talent out there, that can serve and wants to serve in a Presidential administration. So we are going to redouble our efforts to recruit talented and gifted Latinos that come from every walk of life. It comes from academia, it comes from elected officials. It comes from foundations and non-for profits. Maybe some will come from the media. And we want to identify as much talent as possible. And you know, obviously the Latino community is growing faster than just about any other community. And that means that we have got to prepare leadership for the future, not just for today.

{"id": 1946, "text": "Before we talk about your visit here to Hartford, the head of the NRA, Charlton Heston, said that the White House and the Justice Department lack the spine to enforce the existing gun control laws. How do you respond to this? Well, first of all, let me say what the substance of his claim is. They say that we are bringing fewer criminal prosecutions in the Federal courts for violations of the gun laws than were being brought a few years ago. The truth is that prosecutions for violations of the gun laws are increasing in America. But we have a partnership between the Federal prosecutors and the State prosecutors. And more of the minor cases are being brought at the State level now, and the major multistate cases are being brought at the Federal level. But let me say, the more important thing is why is Charlton Heston saying this? Because he does not want us to do background checks when people buy guns at gun shows or at urban flea markets. He did not want us to do background checks when people bought handguns in gun stores, and they said it would not do any good. But we know that 400,000 people, because of a criminal background, could not buy guns under the Brady bill. We know we have got the lowest crime rate and the lowest murder rate in 30 years. So he is just wrong about it. We also know that America is still a country that is too dangerous, because we are the only country in the world that still does not have enough sensible restraints on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and children. Let us talk about, now, your visit to Hartford. Tell us why this new markets initiative is so important to you. It is important to me because even though we have the longest peacetime economic expansion in history, over 19 million new jobs, highest homeownership ever, lowest unemployment rate in 29 years, the lowest welfare rolls in 30 years, the lowest poverty rates in 20 years, the lowest Hispanic- and African-American unemployment rates we have ever recorded. In spite of all that, there are still all these people and places that have not felt this recovery, that need investments and businesses and jobs and hope.

{"id": 1947, "text": "And what incentives can you offer them that are not in place right now? We can offer them tax credits, and we can offer them loan guarantees. And we can offer them modest expenditures of public funds to support these kinds of investments. They will make a big difference. For example, if let us just take a poor neighborhood in Houston or San Antonio or even here in Hartford, where there is a very large Hispanic population. Let us suppose that we wanted to have a $150 million investment. Under this proposal, if my bills were to become law, they could put $50 million in equity, and they would get a 25 percent tax credit. They could borrow $100 million and have it under a Federal loan guarantee, which would dramatically lower the interest rate. So you would say, okay, you are taking a little bit of a risk investing in a poor area, but we will cut the risk way, way down. Yet a disproportionate number live in poverty, do not have health care, and cannot get a job. Why has the American dream eluded them? Well, let me start with the positives. We also have more successful Hispanics in America than ever before, more people like you and the people that work for Telemundo. We have the lowest unemployment rate we have ever recorded, and we started keeping separate Latino unemployment rates in the early seventies. Number one, a lot of the Hispanic population of America are recent immigrants. Recent immigrants always have more problems with health insurance and with employment. They have not very often mastered English; they often do not have the right contacts. So part of that is inevitable. But there are some other things that I'd like to point out. Because of the family traditions that have been so strong in Hispanic families, very often the children would leave school early to go to work. And that worked for generation upon generation of Hispanic families, the people that had been here for 50, 60, 80 years. It does not work anymore because if you drop out of high school, your chances of getting a good job with a growing income are very, very small. And the biggest separate social problem we have with Hispanics in America today is the dropout rate from school is way too high. Last year, for the first time ever, the graduation rates of non-Hispanic whites and African-Americans was almost identical. Hispanics are still dropping out at a very rapid rate. So we have started this Hispanic education initiative to try to overcome that.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmariaelvirasalazartelemundonoticierohartfordconnecticut", "title": "Interview With Maria Elvira Salazar of Telemundo Noticiero in Hartford, Connecticut", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-maria-elvira-salazar-telemundo-noticiero-hartford-connecticut", "publication_date": "05-11-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

And we have to try to get more Hispanic young people to go on to college. I think that is there are a lot of other things, but that is the single most significant thing that we can do something about is getting people to stay in high school. The fact that we have so many immigrants, they will always have more problems in the beginning, and we just have to integrate them as quickly as we can. I think you have answered my next question, but I want to ask you anyway, and it has to do with youth. In the barrio in New York City, or in any barrio in the United States, there is a 12-year-old boy whose name is Juan Gonzalez, let us say. His parents struggle to make a living and provide him with a decent education. What message do you have for him, a kid that was born in the United States? My message to him is, if you stay in school and you learn your lessons, no matter how difficult your economic circumstances, you can now go on to college in America. We have changed the rules in the last 6 years. If your parents come up with some money, they can get a tax credit back for it. We have more generous scholarships. We have more other funds for you to go. You must stay in school. You can go to college if you stay in school. And if you do, you can make the life that you dream of. Let us talk a little bit about Cuba. The democratically elected leaders of 17 Spanish-speaking nations will gather in Havana in the next couple of weeks. Are you concerned that they are legitimizing Castro's government? I am a little concerned about it. I think the important thing is, when they go there, I hope that they will reaffirm their support for democracy and for human rights and for a transition to democracy and to an open economy in Cuba. As you know, most countries do not agree with our policy on Cuba. They think that it hurts the Cuban people, that it hurts the American business community, and that it does not speed the transition away from Castro because they think we give him an excuse for the failures of the Cuban society, that he can blame everything on us instead of having to take responsibility for himself.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmariaelvirasalazartelemundonoticierohartfordconnecticut", "title": "Interview With Maria Elvira Salazar of Telemundo Noticiero in Hartford, Connecticut", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-maria-elvira-salazar-telemundo-noticiero-hartford-connecticut", "publication_date": "05-11-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

The most important thing for me, though, is I have every time I have reached out to Cuba, and I have tried to increase contacts, to make it easier for people in America to send money home, to have direct telephone service, to have more trips to Cuba more accessible for people, and you know, something happens. He put journalists in jail, or shot the Brothers to the Rescue people out of the air. I do not care even if they had been inside the territorial waters of Cuba, which they were not , there is a convention which binds the United States and Cuba which would not have permitted them to be shot down, because they did not present a threat. So all my efforts to change things have been met with a rebuff. And it makes me wonder whether he really wants this to change, because he can always use us as an excuse. But if the countries want to go there and meet, I understand that. If they differ with us on their policy, I respect their right to differ. But I hope when they are in Cuba, they will make it clear that they are for democracy and human rights. Have you expressed this to any of the Presidents? I have said that to every one of them that I have seen since they made the decision to go down there. And do you ever foresee normalized relations with Castro and the United States? I think we could certainly do a lot more for food, for medicine, in other ways, if the circumstances were right. And I think that if there were a clear commitment to a transition to democracy and human rights, which were clear and verifiable, I think that you could see some really dramatic changes. I think you know, if we could just have a commitment to have no more shootings, like the shootings of the airplanes, and to have no more clear oppressings of human rights, it would be easier. I think the American people would like to be reconciled with the Cuban people. It is painful most of all, I think, for the Cuban-Americans. I come from that group. They tell me two more questions.

They are after Israel and Egypt, Colombia is the third-biggest recipient of American aid. I am very concerned about the combination of the narcotraffickers and the people that have been engaged in the civil war down there totally destabilizing Colombia. They have already hurt the economy. They have divided the society. They have weakened the country and its government. And it is a big, big country with enormous significance for all of Latin America. If you look at the Venezuelan border, the trouble we have seen there, if you look at all the problems that could be presented with Panama, with the canal going back there, and if you look at all the countries to the south, if you look at Bolivia, Peru, the problems they have had there, the future of Colombia is very, very important. And Colombia borders Amazonia, and all the problems that could be created there. So we should be working with them, and we should help them. But, you know, if you look at the whole of the history of America's involvement in Latin America, if we were to become directly involved, I think it would ensure a disastrous result for the Colombian Government, and people would accuse us of being imperialists in some way. I have worked very hard to reach out to Latin America in a way that no other American ENTITY has, at least since President Kennedy, to be a friend, to be a partner, to be supportive, and not to be a dictator, not to be an imperialist, not to be abusive in our relationship. So I am going to keep trying to help Colombia. But I do not think we should be drawn directly into their conflict, because I think it would boomerang. I do not think it would work, and I think it would actually hurt the cause of freedom and the integrity of governments in Latin America. The U.S.S. Eisenhower is scheduled to begin exercises December 1st off the coast of Puerto Rico in Vieques. Will you approve the use of live fire?

{"id": 1951, "text": "Let me say, as I have said before, I think the fact that there was an agreement made back in 1983, that then the Navy and the Defense Department regularly and flagrantly ignored, treating Puerto Rico as if it were still a colony, is really at the root of all this. I think that, as you know, that the Pentagon has a point, in the sense that if you look at what we had to do in Kosovo, for example, or what we had to do earlier in Bosnia, they need to be able to train. They have to be able to do live-fire training somewhere. They need to be able to fly over water. We also have to do landings. You know, when we restored the democratically elected government of Haiti, thank God there was no violence, but there could have been. And we have to practice, you know, how do we approach on the shore? On the other hand, we do not want to be in a position of jamming down the throat of Puerto Rico, and the people and the elected officials of Puerto Rico, one bad memory after another of a longstanding relationship where we did not honor our commitments. So what Secretary Cohen has tried to do is take the security report he got saying, you know, we need to use Vieques for 5 more years and the reality of the feelings of the people of Puerto Rico and the positions of the leaders, and we are trying hard to work through both of those in a way that there can be an agreement. I think the most important thing is we get out of this treating Puerto Rico as if it were literally, for these purposes, a colony of the United States. And if you know, I think the Congress should give them an authoritative vote on whether they want to be a State or continue commonwealth status. I mean, the last vote they had was very close, narrowly for commonwealth, but it was not a sanctioned vote by the Congress. So I have done as much as I could to try to restore the integrity of the relationship between the people and the Government of Puerto Rico and the United States. And so for me, because I am the Commander in Chief and I also have heavy responsibilities to ensure the preparedness and the integrity of our Armed Forces there is a reason we lost no pilots on Kosovo.

I even went down for the big old ENTITY watch when you were over on the Vineyard this summer, and I am sorry I missed you. So let us talk about a couple of things. First of all, you need to know that all the kids over at Framingham High are looking forward to your coming down with Senator Kennedy. And let us talk about this education bill. Even Jack Anderson is calling you the education ENTITY. Well, we have worked very hard on education, and Senator Kennedy has had a lot to do with it. A lot of our education initiatives have not attracted a great deal of public notice, maybe because we have been successful in getting bipartisan support for them, for most of them, all but the college loan program. The program to provide middle class college loans at lower interest rates had no Republican support because we took on some organized interest groups. And it is a real tribute to Ted Kennedy because he got the expansion of Head Start in, he got the national service program in. And this education act we are signing in Boston tomorrow, or in Framingham, has an incredible amount of good things in it. It is a dramatic reform in terms of putting more responsibility back on local school districts, giving them freedom from Federal rules and regulations but giving them very high standards to shoot for. It is a really it is a very modern, exciting, and I think, effective piece of education legislation. I am proud to be signing it. Well, you know, ENTITY, Senator Kennedy is not only delighted to have you here signing that particular bill, but as you know, this is the toughest race the Senator has ever faced in 32 years. And for many of us in Massachusetts, we are surprised to know that nationally he is one of several seats that we are looking at that could be in very serious jeopardy. Your coming out here to help him will be bringing a message to Massachusetts voters that says what? How important is Senator Kennedy and his reelection to the completion of your agenda as you go back to Washington? He is terribly important to doing it. And he is important for some reasons that people, I think, may not be aware of in Massachusetts.

{"id": 1953, "text": "But I can tell you, I have been talking around here the last week, just asking people, and there is a general feeling here that of all the people in the Congress, Ted Kennedy is one of the four or five who are most receptive to new ideas, to trying new things, to breaking out in new directions. And if you just look at what we have done in education, we have changed the whole national approach to education. Have national standards, have the National Government helping, but give people the freedom at the grassroots level to try new things and to do things that will work. And he is also been instrumental in developing a national apprenticeship program for young people who do not go to college and, as I said, this college loan program. We have had the most impressive set of achievements in the last year and a half in education we have seen in the last 35 years, a lot of cutting-edge, new ideas, and Ted Kennedy has done it. The other thing he is very good at that I think people do not appreciate is he is the best Democratic legislator at getting Republicans to support what he is doing. He is the best at getting bipartisan support. And I think that if the people of Massachusetts know that, they would be more inclined to reelect him, because he is really a very forward-looking Member of the Congress, and we need him back. Well, one of the things that the First Lady said when she was in a couple of weeks back I was happy to be at the dinner that she hosted for the Senator she went so far as to say that Senator Kennedy's opponent, Mitt Romney, is really just another clone for Phil Gramm and another Senator no for you. Are you as worried about that? Do you want to make any predictions on all of these GOP threats that they are going to be taking over the Senate and taking over the Congress this time around? Well, I do not think they will if we can get the facts out there. I mean, we have made the Government work for ordinary Americans. We have passed things like family leave and the Brady bill and immunizations for all the kids in this country under 2, against ferocious Republican opposition. We have got more highwage jobs coming into the economy in 1994 than the previous 5 years combined.

It is no offense to Mr. Romney, but they all in the last few days of the legislative session up here, we had an important piece of environmental legislation, the Superfund bill to clean up toxic waste dumps. Everybody in America was for it. We had the chemical companies, the unions, the Sierra Club; they were all for it first time they had ever agreed on anything. There was no one in America against it except over 40 Republican Senators who filibustered it to death to keep people like Ted Kennedy from coming back to Massachusetts and saying we helped to clean up toxic waste dumps. They were willing to leave the poison in the ground. They killed lobby reform and campaign finance reform. And all the lobbyists were cheering Senator Helms when he walked off the floor of the Senate and saying how great it was. Now, I do not think the American people want to turn the Congress over to them. And especially, I do not think they want to go back to trickle-down Reaganomics. That is what they have promised to do, you know. They have promised to give us the economic policies that they did in the eighties that put New England in the ditch. And I do not think that the people will support it once they know that. Well, you know, one of the things that I loved about your campaign, ENTITY, was the slogan It is the economy, stupid. And it seems as though, with all the indicators macroeconomically looking so terrific what is the deal with cynical voters? I mean, how do we get this message out? It seems to me that you cannot win for losing, even when everything looks good. And that is that we have had 20 years when most wages have been stagnant for hourly wage earners and when people have been changing jobs more frequently, so that makes them more insecure. The average 18-year-old, for example, will change jobs six, seven times in a lifetime now. So even though people may say the unemployment rate is dropping and new jobs are coming into America, into Massachusetts, there is still an unsettled feeling.

But a lot of these folks who are on the far right, they never have anybody on that disagrees with them, they never have an honest discussion, and they are not as careful as they ought to be with their facts. I think it is good to have your critics on there and to have honest debates. We should not all agree on everything, and no one in America, including the ENTITY, is right about everything. But what I think the American people ought to insist on from talk radio is a conversation, not a screaming match, and strict adherence to the facts. That is the only thing that bothers me. I think generally this talk radio phenomenon can be a great instrument in promoting democracy. People feel so isolated from Washington, so isolated from the bureaucracies. A lot of folks even feel isolated from their State capital. So if talk radio makes people feel like they have got a voice, they can be heard, then that is good.

But I am feeling good about it. getting our relationship straight with the Russians and reducing the nuclear threat in that part of the world, and toward getting an international economic order set up.

Our optimism, our unfailing faith in our ability to make the future better has been one of the great secrets to our successes over the last 200 years. And so I do feel that. I regret that at this moment in our history there is a lot of accumulated cynicism and frustration and that it is, in some ways, more difficult for the ENTITY to communicate directly to the American people than it has been in the past, because of all the indirect filters between me and the American people. The Presidency is more isolated than I wish it were, partly because of the security concerns that exist in this day and age.

What is it that you want them to do now in this make-or-break time? I want them to remember how strongly the people voted for peace and for the Good Friday accords and to find an honorable resolution of the admittedly thorny problems. Because whatever the difficulties of going forward, they are very small compared to the difficulties of letting the peace process fall apart. Now, you say there are thorny problems, and that is the difficulty and especially the problem of decommissioning. Would you be urging the Sinn Fein to do what Ulster Unionists are urging Sinn Fein to do, to namely sign up to a timetable for disarmament and give a categorical assurance that the IRA will have disarmed completely by May 2000? I think that all the parties should fully comply with the terms of the Good Friday accords, and that is what I would say. I think that they all have to find a way we know what the problems, the legitimate problems the Sinn Fein have with the decommissioning issue. But it is an important part of the Good Friday accords, so there has to be a resolution of it that enables the leadership of the Unionists, Mr. Trimble and the others who have fought for peace, to survive, to sustain their position, and to go forward and get everybody on their side to honor the Good Friday accords, too. They can find a way to do this if they decide that the price of failure is far higher than the price of compromise. And I think there is a good chance they will do it; even if it is 11th hour, I do. Their position has been that there has to be guns handed over, actual hardware, before Sinn Fein can go into government. Do you think they should be considering moving ahead on the basis of pledges rather than actually looking for the armaments? Well, I believe that on that score, Mr. Trimble is satisfied in these talks with whatever commitment is made, and I think they should give it a chance to work. One thing I would say to the Unionists is that they can always walk away from this if the commitments are not made at a later date.

There are extremely strong indications that the Orangemen will not be allowed to go down the Catholic section of the Garvaghy Road. How concerned are you about what the impact of a refusal to let the Orangemen go down Garvaghy Road could be, both on the streets and on the political process? Well, as an outsider, you know, to me this looks like the most difficult of decisions because it is there is enormous emotional content on both sides. It is not just a matter of a lot of people walking on a certain road. And I think however it is resolved this year, the most important thing is that the parties themselves try to find a larger, omnibus resolution for this that reflects the spirit of the Good Friday accords. Keep in mind, I mean, the spirit of the Good Friday accords is that both sides should have respect for and get respect from one another, and that no one should have to give up his or her heritage or traditions, but they should be pursued with some sensitivity to how others feel as well. So I think that they are in a terrible bind now because the Drumcree deadline is coming up against the negotiation deadline. And so, however it is resolved, I think that what the leaders should be thinking about is, what is the long-run resolution of this? How can we show one another the necessary respect and sensitivity that will put this marching issue in the context of the commitment of the Good Friday accords, which is to push toward reconciliation and equality within the principle of consent? At the time of the Good Friday agreement, you waited up through the night in Washington, inside the White House, seeing how the negotiations were working out. You went on the phone personally and spoke to the main parties and tried to coax them forward. This week, with a new deadline, are you willing to do the same, to intervene personally?

It means a lot to the American people.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarkdevenportthebritishbroadcastingcorporationwestportconnecticut", "title": "Interview With Mark Devenport of the British Broadcasting Corporation in Westport, Connecticut", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mark-devenport-the-british-broadcasting-corporation-westport-connecticut", "publication_date": "28-06-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

And I also believe, as I have said many times, that if this can be resolved if we can get over this next hurdle and go forward I think it will give courage to the advocates of peace in the face of religious and ethnic problems in other parts of the world. You know, we are just getting off the ground with our efforts in Kosovo. There are many difficulties there, and the accumulated grievances there, from mass killing and mass uprooting, are deeper, if you will, just in terms of human loss than all the things that have happened in Ireland. But people have this sense that the divisions in Ireland go back such a long time, that if they can be overcome, I think it would give great heart to the proponents of peace in the Balkans and Africa and the Middle East, because the new Prime Minister is about to announce a government there; we have a chance again to make progress and peace in the Middle East. And I think that from my point of view, as someone who is interested in not only the country of my roots but the rest of the world, I think that it is hard to overstate; it is hard to overstate the impact a positive or a negative outcome could have on such actions in the rest of the world. Finally, ENTITY, there is only so much that you or, indeed, the British and Irish Prime Ministers can do to coax people along. Is this the time when Northern Ireland's political leaders have to stand on their own two feet? Well, I think they can know that we can coax them, and we can stand with them, and we can support them, and we can bring them benefits in all kinds of ways after this is resolved. But in the end, the leaders have to decide. Their people have voted for peace.

Between Nene and Varejao and Barbosa, they have got a good team. So it took a while for our guys to kind of get into rhythm, but we are so much deeper that over time you get a sense they are going to wear them down. I do not think it will be close in the second half. U.S.A. Basketball, ENTITY, has undergone a culture change. They bottomed out a little bit in 2004 with the Bronze, and then Coach Krzyzewski came aboard and really turned it around. Well, obviously, Coach K is one of the greatest coaches of all time. He knows how to bring together folks to think like a team. And obviously, the talent that we have got at this point is unbelievable. So there is no reason we should not bring home the Gold. You really get a sense of how proud they are to represent the United States, and I think they are going to conduct themselves really well in London. One of the subjects of great debate of late, started by one Kobe Bryant, was the fact that he feels that the present constitution of the team would beat the 1992 original version. Can you weigh in on that argument for us? I was around in '92. I was a Bulls fan, so I have got to go with the original Dream Team. And I suspect that Michael and Sir Charles and others would point out they were probably never down at any point in any of their games. But this is a great team, unbelievable talent, and Kobe is a competitor, so you expect him to do a little trash talking whenever the opportunity arises. Everybody knows that. And you are involved in coaching your daughters. We saw the U.S.A. Women's National Team win by a big margin earlier tonight. How would you characterize your experience in coaching your two daughters? Well, first of all, I want to congratulate the women's team. They are going to be as dominant, if not more dominant, I think in the Olympics. And wonderful young women; they are great role models for my daughter.

I think the aging of America and the children of the country. It is ironic that we seem to be growing at both ends. We are going to double the number of people over 65, and yet, we have the largest group of schoolchildren in our country's history in our schools, the first group bigger than the baby boomers, and they are much, much more diverse. They come from more different ethnic and racial and religious backgrounds. And I think that dealing with them are the two biggest things that ought to be on the front burner. I also believe that, related to that, obviously, as you have heard me say many times, is the challenge of continuing to grow the economy while reaching out into poor areas, continuing to improve the environment, and paying the debt off. ENTITY, one of the things I have noticed about these celebrations that the White House, you, and the First Lady are planning is that it is propagating the myth that January 1st is the start of the new millennium and the new century. Are you guilty of creating that erroneous impression? I mean, I think basically, by common consent, everybody decided that we ought to celebrate the millennium on January 1, 2000, even though most of the strict correctionists say that it is January 1, 2001. Well, apparently, that was the prevailing view among the experts, but the people have expressed a different wish, so we are going with the folks. We have got a democracy here, and that is the way we are going. It will be nice for me. Maybe I can do it twice, and I will be a ENTITY of two millennial changes. Well, looking ahead into the next century, whenever it begins, where do you see the power of the Presidency itself evolving? But I think it will always at least for the future that I can foresee will continue to be an extremely important office. I think that a lot of the executive actions will be important, along with getting along with Congress. I think that building partnerships with the private sector will become more important. It will become more important to mobilize the American people and to organize them to meet the challenges in the future the way we have done.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarkknollerandpetermaercbsradioorlandoflorida", "title": "Interview With Mark Knoller and Peter Maer of CBS Radio in Orlando, Florida", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mark-knoller-and-peter-maer-cbs-radio-orlando-florida", "publication_date": "11-12-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Then we go out and try to hustle up all the equipment and the Internet connections and get everybody to do that. So I think you will see a lot more of that. The other thing I think you will see is, I believe the world is growing ever more interdependent, so I think the ENTITY, in order to effectively lead the world, will have to be an increasingly effective negotiator, conciliator, bringing people together, working people together. And I think it will be just as important 30 years from now for America to be involved in the rest of the world as it is now. But I think it will be an increasingly interdependent world that will require powers of persuasion and not just unilateral power. Next year is also, as you well know, the final year of your Presidency. Do you find that in any way liberating to try and do things that you were not able to do in the first years of your Presidency? I find it it is concentrated my attention and my energies and, obviously, since I am not running, I could do things in an election year that might be difficult to do otherwise. But if you go back, I mean, we have taken a lot of controversial decisions. That is one of the reasons we lost the Congress in '94; we took on the gun lobby and the health care lobby and the deficit issue at the same time, and it was more than the system could bear, I think. But I do think that I am acutely mindful of the fact that I have 14 months left, and that I need to be out there squeezing the most out of every day. And I need to get as much done as I can for the American people, to try to leave our country in the best possible shape so that the next President and the next Congress will be even freer than they are to basically look with a visionary eye to the future and take on the big issues.

But after I am out of office and there is a new team in, I still think it is very important that they keep the American people focused on these big issues in the 21st century, because a society rarely has the luxury of having the tools and the space to deal with these longterm challenges that we now have. And I think it is very important that we seize it. Let me ask you one specific, if I may, on the question of gays in the military. As you no doubt know, the First Lady this past week was critical of the do not ask, do not tell policy. You were not going to institute that at the beginning of your Presidency, anyway. And what do you think of what the First Lady said this week? First of all, I am quite sympathetic with what she said. I think that was the position that both of us brought to the White House. The reason that I went for do not ask, do not tell is that it is all I could do because I had a clear signal from the Congress that if I implemented my policy, they would reverse it by overwhelming majorities. I did not implement do not ask, do not tell until the Senate voted 68-32 against the policy that I wanted. For me, what is important is that the policy, as implemented, does not work as I announced it and as the leaders of our military at that time in '93 pledged to implement it. I can only hope this last brutal beating death of a gay soldier will give some sobering impetus to a reexamination about how this policy is implemented and whether we can do a better job of fulfilling its original intent. Let me remind you that the original intent was that people would not be rooted out; that they would not be questioned out; that this would be focused on people's conduct, and if they did not violate the code of conduct, and they did not tell, that their comings and goings, the mail they got, the associates they had, that those things would not be sufficient to kick them out of the military or certainly subject them to harassment.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarkknollerandpetermaercbsradioorlandoflorida", "title": "Interview With Mark Knoller and Peter Maer of CBS Radio in Orlando, Florida", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mark-knoller-and-peter-maer-cbs-radio-orlando-florida", "publication_date": "11-12-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Now, as for but I do not have any problem with what she says, because that is after all, that is what I said back in '93, and if anybody you know, if there is a sense in the Congress or in the next White House that that ought to be done, then maybe together they will have enough votes to do it. You mentioned earlier the importance of future Presidents becoming even more mediators and conciliators on the world scene. This coming week, of course, Syria and Israel are going to be at the White House. And I know you told us, at the news conference, you have taken a blood oath to avoid discussing details of those long-stalled talks, the renewal of them, but how do you plan just in general, since you do not want to go into details how do you plan to get this process moving and keep it moving when you get these gentlemen sitting down again? Well, I want to get them together, let them talk, and get them to try to agree on an agenda and a timetable. They know what the issues are, and they know what the options are for resolving the issues. And my experience has been that competent people and you are dealing with two highly competent people here; I mean, these people are good in what they do in representing the interests of their countries, and that when they do not go into these negotiations without some idea about where they want to finish and some idea about where they will have to give, and whether the other person will give, and how it will all play out. So on the other hand, it is difficult, but not as complex, in my view, as the Palestinian negotiations with Israel. So I would like to see them get together, talk together, get to know each other a little better, and agree on an agenda and a timetable, and then take a couple of days off and go back and meet with their respective teams to decide where they are going to start and where they are going to stop, and come back here and just look to burn through it, just keep going until we get the thing done.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarkknollerandpetermaercbsradioorlandoflorida", "title": "Interview With Mark Knoller and Peter Maer of CBS Radio in Orlando, Florida", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mark-knoller-and-peter-maer-cbs-radio-orlando-florida", "publication_date": "11-12-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Today you issued a written statement expressing deep regret for the deaths at No Gun Ri. But the word apologize did not appear in that statement. Is there a reason for that, that you drew a distinction between expressing regret and apologizing?

Well, I think the most I should say about this now is that in this particular case, and in this case only, I reviewed the evidence that we had, and we concluded that we should take him off the killed-in-action list and put him on the missing list, which means, obviously, that we have some information that leads us to believe that he might be alive. What does the United States do about it? Well, now that we have some information, we will begin well, we have already begun working to try to determine whether, in fact, he is alive; if he is, where he is; and how we can get him out. Because, since he was a uniformed service person, he is clearly entitled to be released, and we are going to do everything we can to get him out. If Iraq was holding an American, they could not use it as an issue with the United States unless they let us know they had somebody. Why would they hold somebody and not let us know about it? Would that be to their advantage? That is why we did what we did on the classification. We have enough information that makes us believe that at least he survived his crash, at least that that is a possibility, and that he might be alive.

You know, I will be an ex-President when this is done, and I do not believe I should be commenting for some period of time on public affairs, plus which my wife is a Senator. She has to vote on it. So I am going to let she can speak for herself, and the other Democrats and Republicans will speak for themselves. I do not think I should say more. I have known Senator Ashcroft a long time. I know he is genuinely very, very conservative, and that is what is in his heart. But I did not think this was about that, and it surprised and profoundly disappointed me. I thought that with just 9 days left, you might speak out with a little more reckless abandon than usual. Look, I need my Miranda warnings when I talk to you guys, you know. I cannot even make a joke in Chicago without having it blown out of proportion. Well, as long as you raised that issue, were you trying to say that you question the legitimacy of George Bush's election?", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarkknollercbsradiodovernewhampshire", "title": "Interview With Mark Knoller of CBS Radio in Dover, New Hampshire", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mark-knoller-cbs-radio-dover-new-hampshire", "publication_date": "11-01-2001", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

The Supreme Court has ruled, and the rest of us have to accept it. And that confers, in a legal sense, a literal legal sense, that confers legitimacy. But I did not say anything different than I have always said; all the Democrats were disappointed that the votes were not counted. And I was trying to pay a little homage to Bill Daley in his hometown of Chicago, with a lot of his family and friends there, by saying you know, he did, I think, did a very good job running the Vice President's campaign. They did win the popular vote. We were having a good time. Again, let us look back at your 8 years in office, ENTITY. After you were inaugurated in January of 1993, how long do you think it took you to get up to speed as ENTITY? Well, I would say there has there is a different answer to that depending on what the issue the question is. For example, I think that the issues that I talked about today when I reviewed our domestic record on social policy, I think we were ready from day one. I think we were and I think part of that was the fact that I'd been a Governor for a dozen years, that I'd been through a tough economic period, had a clear economic philosophy, had worked on education and welfare reform and crime and the environment. Part of it was the fact that I'd had the opportunity to represent the Governors with the White House and the Congress on many issues. On foreign policy, I think I was up to speed on some things and had to learn a lot on others, and I tried to be a quick study. On the ways of Washington, I think it took us probably, you know, even as much as a year, a year and a half, before we really had a good feel for some of the rather different ways in which the town works and the ways in which what a President does and says communicates itself to the other decisionmakers and to the larger American public in a way that was quite different than had been my experience as Governor.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarkknollercbsradiodovernewhampshire", "title": "Interview With Mark Knoller of CBS Radio in Dover, New Hampshire", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mark-knoller-cbs-radio-dover-new-hampshire", "publication_date": "11-01-2001", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

We passed the first big first we passed the economic plan, which included, among other things, the empowerment zones and the earnedincome tax credit and all the things that got rid of the deficit, as well. And then we passed the family medical law. We passed the Brady law. We passed the crime bill. We passed NAFTA. You know, we did a phenomenal number of things in those first 2 years, substantively. But because of the whole sort of contentious atmosphere, some of the problems that we had with health care and other issues, I think that it was not as successful politically and I say that in the best sense politically, meaning we did not communicate as well to the American people or the other decisionmakers in Washington in a way that people could see exactly what was happening and that we were underway here. So I think it took me longer to get the politics right. I think it took a little while for me to get entirely comfortable with all the foreign policy and national security issues I had to deal with not too long. And I think we were ready on the substance of domestic policy from day one. As we are about to inaugurate a new President, can the American people believe that its new President will be ready for the job on day one, or do we have to give them a period for on-the-job training? Well, I think he is like any new President. I think he has certain strengths and will be ready in some ways, and I do not think any human being can be ready in every way on day one.

I think on national security, he is got a very, very experienced team, so I think that he will get up to speed there in fairly short order. And on domestic policies, we have different views, and that is where the points of greatest conflict were in the campaign between our two sides. But I think on some things, like education, he is had the opportunity to really work in Texas on, and I think his concern is genuine. And on other things, we will just have to see what happens. I mean, I was a Governor for a dozen years, in good times and bad times. So I think that he will need some time to get kind of just the kind of feel the rhythm of some of these domestic issues, because they were not part of his experience. But I think that the American people should not particularly worry about that because he is got a very experienced team, because he has been a Governor, and because the country is in real good shape right now. And I think he will get right up there to speed on the issues as quickly as possible. I am not too worried about that. As you look back over your years in office, are there things, big things, that you wish you could do over or do differently? If I had it to do again, in the first 2 years I might try to pass welfare reform first, and then do health care. Or I would tell the American people that we had to do the deficit reduction first, and there were only two ways to have universal health coverage. Let me just back up and say, a lot of people believe that if the health care plan had been differently designed or something, it could have passed. The truth is that because of the combined effect of the condition of the economy and the inability to raise taxes, we could have neither an employer mandate or a Government-funded program sufficient to insure 100 percent of health care coverage.

I cannot pass either an employer mandate or a tax increase, and you cannot get 100 percent coverage without either one. So we are going to take these five steps now. If I had it to do over again.

To what do you owe this ability to survive bad situations? Well, I'd say a couple of things. I think, first of all, I had an indomitable mother, and I was raised to believe that every person should live on Churchill's edict, Never quit. And I had a high pain threshold.

I always thought it was a job designed to achieve larger purposes for the people you were representing. And that is why I came to New Hampshire to give this speech. Apart from my sentimental attachment to the State, we proved here in '92 that if you have good ideas and they relate to people and their lives and their future, that you can survive personal adversity, because people understood this was about a common, larger endeavor. I never, in the darkest days, I never lost sight of the fact that however many days I had left as ENTITY, every one was a privilege and a pleasure, and I should be working for the people.

You remember when the guy shot up the White House with the assault weapon, although you guys were in more danger than me. The bullets were directed toward the press room, but he did not know that. There were periods when I had an unusually large number of threats, but the Secret Service handled them and did well. Are you going to do a farewell address? I am thinking about it. I have tried to as I mentioned today in my speech here, I tried to structure a series of speeches, in one of which I spoke to the larger world when I went to Great Britain and spoke at Warwick University after about the global challenge of the 21st century. Then I made many of the same points at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. And then I made the education speech in Chicago and this speech here today. And I am going home to Arkansas to speak to the Arkansas Legislature, where I spoke on my inaugural the five times I was Governor, and I will talk a little more about substantive domestic issues.

But I never was controlled by them because I always believed if you were right, you could find a way to change public opinion. Only a fool, I think, ignores research data on a constant basis. You look at research data. But I did I believe that you'd be hard pressed to find any President in the last several decades who is done a larger number of things which were not popular at the moment. And one of the things that I used polls for was to understand how aware the public was of given issues or, if they disagree with me on an issue, what was the most effective argument I could make to try to persuade them. But I did not especially on issues affecting America's future, I never let the polls control me. It passed by one vote, and I knew it was the right thing to do. The decision to help Mexico was opposed 81-15. And let me give you some other things. By contrast, if you took polls in the beginning, it would appear that the public overwhelmingly agreed with me on all the gun safety issues, but there is no question that one of the reasons we lost seats in the Congress in '94 was because of the efforts of the NRA. If you took polls on the health care issue in '94, they all looked to be popular, but it turned out not to be. And the reason for that is but I was not unaware of that; I knew that you have to understand how to read polls. I mean, you could be on a popular issue, but if the people who are against you are more intense than the people who are for you, it will still be a net loss at voting time.

I'd like to ask you as you near the end of your Presidency, sir, what do you think of the news media coverage that you have been subjected to? Well, first of all, that is also been in just a good-natured jest. It is true that I am on the way out. I mean, you cannot and so I have had a good time.

But that is because we are continuing to do things; we are taking these actions like the environmental actions and the other things. I think, on balance, the coverage has been over an 8-year period, on balance has been intense and fair in the sense that I have always had the chance to put my side out. I think that there are unusual pressures on the media today because there are more competitive outlets, and I think that the net effect of that is that sometimes a herd mentality takes over, and one person gets the story wrong, then everybody gets it wrong. I think that the pressure for market share has aggravated the tendency which already exists, not only in our Capital but in every capital in the world, to elevate politics over policy and discord over working together.

The unemployment rate in New York has dropped 2 percentage points since I have been ENTITY. There are still people who want jobs who do not have them. There are people who are stuck in jobs who are not getting raises. So what I want to do is talk about the partnership that I see unfolding in the next couple of years, how New York can make the most of the enterprise zone concept that I am pushing, how New York can make the most of the community development banks that we just created to make loans to low income people in inner cities to start their own businesses and to get investment flowing. I just want to talk about how we can bring this economy back even more and how the people who have not been touched by the recovery can be helped. ENTITY, I wanted to ask you, many of the people that are in the WLIB listening area are very much affected by the fact that jobs are not available to them. We have people involved in their own entrepreneurial efforts who are being frustrated. Part of it is seen as an unwillingness on the part of the Republican administration to target jobs to people in the African-American community. How would your partnership address that? It would do that in several ways. First of all, we are trying to make the African-American community more accessible to capital to start jobs. One real problem we have in America is that once areas get high unemployment rates and people leave it, do not invest there, it is almost impossible to get loans to start businesses and to begin them. Floyd Flake, a Congressman from Queens, has been particularly active in working to help to set up a new network of development banks around the country so that we can get money, capital, into these areas to start businesses. If you look at the opportunities for economic growth within America, inner-city areas and rural areas, especially those that are heavily minority populated are a great opportunity for economic growth, because unemployment is high and the potential for consumer demand to grow is enormous.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarkrileyandlaurablackburnewlibradionewyorkcity", "title": "Interview With Mark Riley and Laura Blackburne of WLIB Radio, New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mark-riley-and-laura-blackburne-wlib-radio-new-york-city", "publication_date": "18-10-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

And one of the things that came out of the crime bill, for example, was a real commitment to try to put people to work at the grassroots level in neighborhoods, solving the problems of the neighborhoods there. And that will become a short-term boost in a lot of our cities throughout the country. Over the long run, what we have got to do is get investment there. And the last thing I want to point out is that we really worked hard to increase the capacity of people in the inner cities to get the training they need to take the jobs that are opening up. Like New York, for example, has gained about 102,000 jobs in the private sector since I have been ENTITY. In the previous 4 years, New York lost 500,000 jobs.

ENTITY, I wanted to ask you about one initiative that you put forward this year, and that is specifically welfare reform. There are a number of poor people and single mothers in our listening audience who feel demonized when the subject of welfare reform comes up, because it appears as though they are being stereotyped in terms of not wanting to work, not wanting to find a job, et cetera, when it has been the experience of many people in our community that this is not the case, that many people on public assistance want desperately to find jobs. Tell us how your welfare reform program would speak to this seeming demonization of single mothers and the poor. Well, first of all, let me say I agree with what you just said. One of the things that I try to say every time I mention this issue is that the people who most want relief from welfare dependency are the people who are on welfare.

{"id": 1983, "text": "What our program would do is to, first of all, try to do more to empower people to move from welfare to work through adequate education and training and health care and child care for the children of welfare recipients, so they can facilitate their move into the workplace. We also have lowered taxes on workers with children who work full-time for very modest wages so they will not be falling back into poverty, there will not be an incentive to go back on welfare if they get a job. Now, the trick is going to be how to create enough jobs for people to get them. That is, once you train people for work and once you say that after 2 years they have to go to work if they are not, then there have to be jobs there available. You either have to have some sort of incentive for the private sector to hire more people, or people have to go to work in public jobs, community service jobs. And we are working on both. I just approved I have approved 18 experiments in 18 separate States to try things to put people from welfare to work. And the State of Oregon has just gotten permission from our administration to actually give welfare checks to private employers as a supplement, and then the employer puts in some pay over and above that. And the idea is that the private work force will grow a lot more because of this extra incentive, and the welfare recipient will get more money than would have been the case just drawing the welfare check by going to work. So we are doing a lot of things in an experimental way right now to try to make sure we have the jobs there, because I am convinced that almost all people on welfare, given the proper training and knowing that their children will not lose their health care coverage, will gladly choose work over welfare. I agree with that, ENTITY. I wanted to ask another question, a little broader, moving away directly from the economy for a moment.  And many of the great things that you have done and wanted to do have been sort of made to appear frivolous and silly. What is it that you do personally your vision of how you see your Presidency going? How do you keep your dream alive? That is one of the best questions anybody's ever asked me.

But I just try to keep my eyes on my vision for this country. I want to keep the American dream alive for every American. I want us to go into the next century with everybody being able to compete and win in this global economy. And I know that the economy is in better shape, that we are doing things for ordinary Americans, like family leave and immunizing children and trying to get investments into poor areas. I know that this country is a safer and more secure place because Russian missiles are not pointed at us, and we are making peace in Haiti, the Middle East, Northern Ireland. I know that we are moving in the right direction, and I just have to keep that flame alive inside me. I tell our staff all the time, when things get really rough around here because of the politics, that it is not important every day what ordinary Americans think about us, but it is important what we think about ordinary Americans every day and that we just keep our vision alive, and I work on it. But you asked a good question, and it is harder some days than others, but I find that if I really follow a disciplined effort to just work at the task every day and to remember the people, the real Americans that are out there I am trying to help, every day is still a joy to go to work. ENTITY, there seems to be a perception afoot among many in the country that the Republican Party seems to be more organized around its agenda than the Democrats are around theirs. Many of your initiatives, including a jobs bill that would have brought some money to New York, were scuttled in some measure or to some extent by members of your own party. Why does it appear to most Americans that the Republicans are organized, they know what they want, but the Democrats do not ? Well, part of it is what they want to do.

I mean, they all voted against it. They just lined up like robots and said no. So they, at the end of this session of Congress, they killed campaign finance reform and political lobby reform and some important environmental measures to clean up toxic waste dumps, for example. They just killed them all because they did not want anybody to be able to say that they'd done these things. You can always find a reason to say no, particularly if you think it is politically advantageous. Now, the Democrats, on the other hand, if you go back 50 years, the Democratic Party has always been, particularly in the Congress, much more diverse. You know, we have very liberal Democrats; we have very conservative Democrats. We have Democrats that come from very rural areas; we have Democrats that come from the inner city. And when you are trying to put together a program to actually do things, it is harder to do. Now having said that, let me just say one thing in defense of the Democrats in the Congress. We have not gotten the figures for this year, but last year, according to the Congressional Quarterly, which is a nonpartisan research service, the Democrats in the Congress supported me more strongly than any President since Roosevelt, except for one brief period when President Johnson was passing the civil rights legislation. And we had a higher rate of success in passing bills through Congress last year, even though the stimulus did not pass, than any President except for President Eisenhower in '53 and President Johnson in '65. So I think that the Congress has gotten a little bit of a bum rap. If they fail to do something, it is news for weeks. If they do something, it is news for 30 minutes. So, we actually if you look at what we did, we passed an economic program that reversed trickle-down economics; we have passed major expansions in global trade; we have done an awful lot.

Well, I think what I would say is that we are nowhere near where we need to be, but keep in mind that when I took office, we had already lost one million jobs in the previous quarter. We had lost more than four million in the previous quarter and we lost another four million in the three months when I came into office, so our economic plan had not even had the chance to take effect. We know the economy was contracting by nine percent when I came in. It was growing by four percent by the time the end of the year came around, so obviously the Recovery Act had an impact. We have got to do more, and that is why we have put together this jobs plan that incorporates the best ideas from Democrats and Republicans, rebuilds our roads, our bridges, our infrastructure, puts teachers back in the classroom. It would have a direct impact on what is going on in Florida, and what we need right now is Congress to go ahead and act, and they have been not acting in the inter-est of Floridians or the American people. You won over a lot of the independent Florida voters, much of them, a couple of years ago base on your theme of Hope and Change. The last couple of days we have had a lot of people tell us they have not seen much change and given our economic outlook, they do not see much hope. Do you feel you have let them down? No, and look, Florida's had a tough time partly because it was ground zero in terms of the housing bubble bursting and real estate has a huge impact on every state. But when you look at Florida, Arizona, Nevada, those places that had the biggest housing bubbles, they have been impacted the most. That is part of the reason why we are not just waiting for Congress to act. This past week, we went ahead and said we are going to help families refinance their homes that could save thousands of dollars for homeowners, keep people in their homes that might be worried about making mortgage payments.

And you know, I think it is certainly a positive development when the Russians and the Syrians both make gestures towards dealing with these chemical weapons. This is what we have been asking for, not just over the last week or the last month, but for the last couple of years, because these chemical weapons pose a significant threat to all nations and to the United States in particular. That is why 98 percent of humanity has said we do not use these. That protects our troops and it protects children like the ones that we saw on those videos inside of Syria. I have to say that it is unlikely that we would've arrived at that point, where there were even public statements like that, without a credible military threat to deal with the chemical weapons use inside of Syria. But we are going to run this to ground. And John Kerry and the rest of my national security team will engage with the Russians and the international community to see, can we arrive at something that is enforceable and serious. You know, one reason that this may have a chance of success is that even Syria's allies, like Iran, detest chemical weapons. Iran, you know, unfortunately was the target of chemical weapons at the hands of Saddam Hussein back during the Iraq/Iran War. And so we may be able to arrive at a consensus in which it does not solve the underlying problems of a civil war in Syria, but it does solve the problem that I am trying to focus on right now, which is making sure that you do not have over 400 children gassed indiscriminately by these chemical weapons. Ban Ki-moon, the U.N. secretary general, says not only control the stockpiles of chemical weapons, but then go ahead and destroy them. He is ready to take that to the U.N. Security Council. That is a lot better than deterring the Syrians from going ahead and using these chemical weapons. Absolutely, and that is why we are going -- we are going to take this seriously, but I have to consistently point out that we have not seen these kinds of gestures up until now.

When I was at the G20, we had some time to discuss this and I believe that Mr. Putin does not see the use of chemical weapons as a good thing inside of Syria, or any place else. And so it is possible that we can get a breakthrough, but it is going to have to be followed up on and we do not want just a stalling or delaying tactic to put off the pressure that we have on there right now. We have to maintain this pressure, which is why I will still be speaking to the nation tomorrow about why I think this is so important. Well, you know, I think that it is important for Assad to understand that, you know, the chemical weapons ban which has been in place is one that the entire civilized world, just about, respects and observes. It is something that protects our troops, even when we are in the toughest war theaters, from being threatened by these chemical weapons. It is something that protects women and children and civilians because these weapons, by definition, are indiscriminate; they do not just target somebody in uniform. And you know, I suspect that some of Assad's allies recognize the mistake he made in using these weapons and it may be that he is under pressure from them as well. You know, again, this does not solve the underlying terrible conflict inside of Syria, but if we can accomplish this limited goal without taking military action, that would be my preference. On the other hand, if we do not maintain and move forward with a credible threat of military pressure, I do not think we will actually get the kind of agreement I'd like to see.

That can be accomplished and it does not solve the broader political situation. I would say to Mr. Assad, we need a political settlement so that you are not slaughtering your own people and, by the way, encouraging some elements of the opposition to engage in some terrible behavior as well. You know, what I am thinking about is right now, though, how do we make sure that we can verify that we do not have chemical weapons that can be used, not only inside of Syria, but potentially could drift outside of Syria? He said in an interview with Charlie Rose that if you, United States, attack, launch military strikes, he said he will respond anythinghe said expect anything, not only from him, but from his allies. That sounds like a threat to the United States. Assad does not have a lot of capability. He has capability relative to children. He has capability relative to an opposition that is still getting itself organized and are not professional, trained fighters. He does not have a credible means to threaten the United States. His allies, Iran and Hezbollah, could potentially engage in asymmetrical strikes against us, but frankly, the kind of threats that they could pose against us are typical of the kinds of threats that we are dealing with around the world that I have spoken of recently, which is embassies that are being threatened, you know, U.S. personnel in the region. Those are threats that we deal with on an ongoing basis. They are always of concern. Obviously, we saw the situation in Yemen just a few weeks ago where we wanted to respond by getting some of our folks out of there.

That is the kind of relationship I hope we can continue.

So we can give him a period in which he is responsible for that, before you go before the Congress.

The big disappointment I felt is one not of a mere incident, it was the fact that we could not in these 8 years get to the place where we could say it now looks as if permanent peace with justice is really in sight. But, on the other hand, if you take achievement over the long run, let us remember what has happened in these 8 years. Our opponents achieved the nitrogen hydrogen bomb. They began to build up an arsenal which, of course, we know is many thousands of megatons in expressed power, in its power; and at the same time during those days we were already fighting one war, there was danger that there was going to be a spread of those hostilities. During the entire first 4 years, I think, the Red Chinese were constantly threatening war, saying they were and they were not only threatening, but often making moves in that direction and at the same time the Russians were saying, We are going to support our Red China allies. Now, there was I believe in this in the governmental actions of the 8 years, the kind of understanding and firmness and readiness to take the risk that prevented those things from happening because I am perfectly sure that weakness would have allowed them to, and a display of weakness, and I mean either moral or physical would have allowed them to spread this war to the great and disastrous consequences of all the earth. So, the achievement I think, one of the achievements has been that we actually have stopped many of these risks from becoming realities, and on the other hand the disappointment is that we have not done better in getting a more constructive and positive indication that real disarmament is around the corner.

Well, let us start, so I may not remember all your questions, I will start with the end of it. By Democratic friends of mine in the Congress it has been proposed to give me back my rank that I resigned in July of 1952 and that, of course, would be a satisfying thing to me simply because it was the 40 years that I put in the military service that would give me a title of my own rather than how do you say Mr. ex-President ?

There, you can have supervision not only subjectively, like the Secretary of the Interior over the Interior subjects, but you can have it functionally because you have two great areas that cause a President work and study every single day of his life. One is everything that touches foreign relations. This is his constitutional duty, and here where we used to think of it, those things falling only within the Department of State, we have now we have representatives of the Labor Department, of the Commerce Department, of the Agriculture Department, we have ICA, we have USIA, and then the Defense Department which now obviously with the stationing of troops abroad everywhere, has a great effect on foreign policy. Now, it is therefore a very tough problem to keep all of these things always on the same road going the same way.

Do you take the view that the economy is moving into a dangerous period that would require this additional governmental action, or do you feel that the proposals made may be extreme and not necessary? of course I am no while I am one of seven sons, I am not the seventh son of a seventh son, so I am not a prophet. Now, we believe, and I am now talking not out of my guesswork, I am talking about the economic analyses, that the economy is swinging and it will be swinging up gradually but steadily so as to provide more revenue than it currently is doing, I mean Federal revenue. Now, this business of going into public works all of a sudden to cure what someone believes is a recession, or to stop a recession I have had a very, very searching study made of this thing and it is not quite complete, but I am going to use it someday in trying to point out that that kind of a problem, or that kind of dependence upon stopping a recession usually gets into effect about 18 months after the recession is all over and you are in your boom period. it picked up the tab for all of the unemployment insurance benefits that had been exhausted by people in the several States and where there was no help. So the Federal Government I think probably put, I do not remember the figures, let us say 600 or 700 million and that 600 or 700 million was far better because it alleviated suffering at the moment and restored some confidence and people naturally began to build and buy again.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference216", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-216", "publication_date": "18-01-1961", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Dwight D.

Whenever you have an issue upon which people feel so strongly, quite obviously it has its political effects, so I would say it would be an important matter. On the other hand, I am hopeful that both parties, Republicans and Democrats, will commit themselves to the same objective of equality of opportunity. I would be surprised if the Republican Party which, after all, is the party of Lincoln and is proud of that fact as it should be, I would be surprised if they did not also support the right of every citizen to have equal opportunities, equal chance under the Constitution. That is the convenient place to blame it, and I suppose that is one of the reasons why we are there, but this is a problem that goes into every community across the country, every family, and everyone has to make a decision. It is going to take time. I think it is finally going to be done, but we are trying to do something much more difficult than any other country has ever done. A good many people who have advised us so generously abroad have no comprehension of what a difficult task it is that faces the American people in the sixties, but I think that the United States Government, I believe that both parties, and I believe that the great mass of opinion is in favor of making progress along these lines.

{"id": 2001, "text": "It is another day of unemployment for them. Do you see any real hope in a booming economy where we still have to have this many unemployed, that in the next, say, 5 years, a second term for you, for instance, we can find a solution to this problem? What it is, it seems to me, is a combination of actions which we are trying to take. What we have to realize is that to even stand still, stay still, we have to move very fast. We have 2 1/2 million more people working than when I came to office and yet a million and a half more people have come into the labor market. The answer, it seems to me, lies in a whole variety of programs. That would be an $11 billion tax cut in a period of 18 months. We are not doing this just because though, of course, everybody would like to have their taxes reduced, but the major reason is because the lift it will give the economy, the assurance it will give us against another recession. So, in answer to your question, I believe that with the combination of the tax cut plus these other programs we can reduce that unemployment from the 5 1/2 percent. Most importantly, we can prevent it from being increased and I think we can get it under 5 percent in the period of 2 years, 2 1/2 years, but we cannot do it by just saying it will be done on its own. Too many people are coming into the labor market and too many machines are throwing people out.

But, as all of the argument about it, discussion about it, and even suggestions from high places, including former President Eisenhower, have a reservation on the treaty, do you think that this has hurt the spirit that prevailed in getting this treaty in the first place? No, if the treaty is not substantial enough to stand discussion and debate, then, of course, it is not a very good treaty. I think what would be most desirable is, after all of this discussion and debate then to get a very strong vote in the Senate.

ENTITY, the only hot war we have got running at the moment is of course the one in Viet-Nam, and we have our difficulties there, quite obviously. I do not think that unless a greater effort is made by the Government to win popular support that the war can be won out there. In the final analysis, it is their war. They are the ones who have to win it or lose it. We can help them, we can give them equipment, we can send our men out there as advisers, but they have to win it, the people of Viet-Nam, against the Communists. We are prepared to continue to assist them, but I do not think that the war can be won unless the people support the effort and, in my opinion, in the last 2 months, the government has gotten out of touch with the people. The repressions against the Buddhists, we felt, were very unwise. It is my hope that this will become increasingly obvious to the government, that they will take steps to try to bring back popular support for this very essential struggle. Do you think this government still has time to regain the support of the people? With changes in policy and perhaps with personnel I think it can. If it does not make those changes, I would think that the chances of winning it would not be very good. Has not every indication from Saigon been that President Diem has no intention of changing his pattern? If he does not change it, of course, that is his decision. He has been there 10 years and, as I say, he has carried this burden when he has been counted out on a number of occasions. Our best judgment is that he cannot be successful on this basis.

Thank you, Dr. Koop, and members of the public community who are here. To Members of Congress, the attorneys general, the representatives of plaintiffs in the private litigation and we have one of the injured parties here representing all of them we thank all of them for coming today. This is a time of prosperity and hope and optimism for America, with our economy improving, making progress on our social problems, our efforts to lead the world to a more prosperous and peaceful future making headway. But I think we all know that this country still has some significant challenges, especially in the health field. And if we think about what we want America to be like in the 21st century, the health of our people and especially the health of our children must be paramount in our thinking, in our vision, and in our efforts. That is why a year ago I worked with the FDA and we launched this nationwide effort to protect our children from the dangers of tobacco by reducing youth access to tobacco products, by preventing companies from advertising to our children. The purpose of the FDA rule was to reduce youth smoking by 50 percent within 7 years. Earlier this year, a Federal judge in North Carolina said that the FDA has the authority to regulate tobacco products to protect the health of our children. There have also been other examples of litigation progress, as you know, brought by private plaintiffs and by the attorneys general. Now, these victories for public health drove the tobacco companies to the bargaining table. They extracted concessions that would have been literally unthinkable just a short time ago. I want to say a special word of thanks to the attorneys general and the other parties who worked hard to negotiate this settlement. Everyone knows we would not be here had it not been for their foresight, their determination, and their relentless efforts. Now we have this unprecedented opportunity to enact comprehensive tobacco legislation, working with all the parties involved, the Members of Congress, the attorneys general, the representatives of injured parties, the public health community, the tobacco farmers, and others.

In the coming weeks I will invite congressional leaders from both parties to the White House to launch a bipartisan effort to enact such legislation.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksproposedtobaccolegislationandexchangewithreporters", "title": "Remarks on Proposed Tobacco Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-proposed-tobacco-legislation-and-exchange-with-reporters", "publication_date": "17-09-1997", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 2008, "text": "There are five key elements that must be at the heart of any national tobacco legislation. That is why I believe the first thing any tobacco legislation must include is a comprehensive plan to reduce teen smoking, including tough penalties. These penalties should be non-tax-deductible, uncapped, and escalating to give the tobacco industry the strongest possible incentive to stop targeting children as new customers. One of the surest ways of reducing youth smoking is to increase the price of cigarettes. Today I call for a combination of industry payments and penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by up to a dollar and a half a pack over the next decade, as needed, to meet our youth reduction targets. And I call upon the House to follow the lead of the United States Senate and repeal the provision giving the tobacco industry a $50 billion tax credit. Second, any legislation must affirm the full authority of the FDA to regulate tobacco products. I believe the FDA's jurisdiction over tobacco products must be as strong and effective as its authority over drugs and devices. In particular, legislation cannot impose any special procedural hurdles on the FDA's regulation of tobacco products. Third, effective legislation must include measures to hold the industry accountable, especially in any efforts to market products to children, while insisting on changes in the way it does business. I ask the industry again to make a voluntary commitment to stop advertising to children. And I call upon Congress to pass legislation providing for broad document disclosure so that the public can learn everything the tobacco companies know about the health effects of their products and their attempts to market to our children. Fourth, Federal tobacco legislation must aim not only to reduce youth smoking but to meet other health goals as well. These include the reduction of secondhand smoke, the expansion of smoking prevention and cessation programs, the strengthening of international efforts to control tobacco, and the provision of funds for medical research and other important health objectives. We must build on the bipartisan agreement to fund children's health care in the recent balanced budget. And finally, any tobacco legislation must protect tobacco farmers and their communities. We know that tobacco farmers are honest, hardworking people, most of whom live and work on small, family owned farms. In some States, entire communities rely on income from the tobacco crop. Any legislation must protect these farmers, their families, and their communities from loss of income. Let me say in closing, I want to thank the Vice President especially, who cares so passionately about this issue.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksproposedtobaccolegislationandexchangewithreporters", "title": "Remarks on Proposed Tobacco Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-proposed-tobacco-legislation-and-exchange-with-reporters", "publication_date": "17-09-1997", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

I have asked him to take the lead in building broad bipartisan support around the country for our plan. I also want to thank Secretary Shalala, Secretary Glickman, and Bruce Reed, and all those who worked so hard on our administration's analysis of the proposed settlement and where we are. And finally, let me say again, we would not be here if it were not for all the people in this room and the countless others they represent around the country. To me, this is not about money. It is not about how much money we can extract from the tobacco industry. It is about fulfilling our duties as parents and responsible adults to protect our children and to build the future of this country. We are doing everything we can in this administration to give parents the tools they need to raise their children, but parents have to be our partners as well. If this is not just about money, we have to recognize that even beyond the tobacco companies and all of us in this room, every parent in America has a responsibility to talk to their children about the dangers of tobacco, illegal drugs, and other things that can hurt them. We know if we have strong parental responsibility here, they can make a great deal of difference in protecting our children as well. If we take responsibility, if we pass this legislation, if we do what we should here, if the tobacco industry will work with us, if other Members of Congress in both parties will work with us, we will have gone a very long way toward creating the state of health for our children that will make America an even greater nation in the new century. ENTITY, what are the chances of the Congress adopting your policy? Well, first of all, I was encouraged by some of the comments that were made by some industry representatives. I think that they know that they have to have Federal legislation. They have an interest in that as well. And I would hope that they would be willing to work with us. But we cannot have the FDA crippled here, and we have to have real and meaningful penalties if the targets for youth smoking are not met. And so I feel very good about that. I think the Congress I think it is highly likely that they will take action. When they take action depends, I think, upon when they can work through the issues for themselves and how they decide how to divide up the work among the committees.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksproposedtobaccolegislationandexchangewithreporters", "title": "Remarks on Proposed Tobacco Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-proposed-tobacco-legislation-and-exchange-with-reporters", "publication_date": "17-09-1997", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 2010, "text": "We could have hearings on this fairly soon, and I would hope to work with the Congress to develop a bill that would embody these principles. ENTITY, you have not said what you are willing to agree to for the tobacco industry. Are you willing to agree to immunity from future liability? Well, I do not think they have asked for future liability, I think they have asked for immunity from liability for past suits. And the question there would be, what are they willing to agree to? They need to come and meet with us. We need to discuss it, and we need to see whether we can embody these five principles. To me, I will say again, this is not primarily about money. This is about changing the behavior of the United States, both the behavior of the tobacco companies, the behavior of the American people, the future behavior of our children. I am trying to create an environment here with these five principles that I believe would achieve that. And if they want to be our partners in it, I think we can get there. Are you willing to put your prestige on the line to ensure that this becomes law? Well, I think my personal prestige on this has been on the line for more than a year now. There for a while, I thought more than my prestige was on the line. You know, for a person involved in public life in Washington today, personal prestige may be an oxymoron. But at least you still have your neck most days. What do you say to the people ENTITY, how do you protect the well-being of tobacco farmers sounds like you are going to take away their livelihood. Well, there are a number of things which can be done, and I do not want to get into the details. Secretary Glickman can talk about it. But we have had farmers in various sectors in our agriculture society facing constricted incomes before, and we have done things which helped them. There was a for example, I remember a few years ago something that affected dairy farmers in my State. There was a massive buyout program for dairy farmers, and in a lot of States like Arkansas, there were any number of small farmers that were having a very difficult time who had a chance to start their life on a different basis. I do not want to minimize this. Tobacco has a very high return per acre.

They have not done anything illegal. They are good, hard-working, taxpaying citizens, and they have not caused this problem. And we cannot let them, their families, or their communities just be crippled and broken by this. And I do not think any member of the public health community wants to do that. And the Agriculture Department and I am personally very committed to this part; to me, this is one of the five things we have to do. We are trying to change America and make everybody whole. And they deserve a chance to have their lives and be made whole and go on with the future as well, and I am determined to see that they are a part of this. What do you say to the attorneys who thought this was a good deal and very proudly proclaimed it? Well, first of all, they were a part of all these ongoing reviews. Everybody was heard in this review process. And secondly, they all recognize, too, that this agreement has to be ratified by Congress. The tobacco companies recognize that. That means that all of us who are part of that process are, in effect, parties to this case, too. And that is the way you need to look at this. We are building on their deal. We are not rejecting their agreement. We are building on it. We are not rejecting what the attorneys general did. We are building on it. Look, if it had not been for what they did, we would not be here. I realize that there were two great things that started this. One is what Dr. Kessler and what we did at the FDA, and the fact that our administration was the first one ever willing to take this on. The other was the actions by the attorneys general and the private lawsuits that got the disclosure of the documents that created a total change in the public attitude and the public efforts here. And then long before that, there were the efforts of all of these people here from the public health community who have been telling us all this for years. And they had the public primed for it. Then the lawsuits brought about the disclosures, and then the FDA was moving. Those three things together, I think and of course, now there have been a lot of congressional hearings.

And I think we can get legislation that will reflect it. What do you think about the string of air crashes, ENTITY, that have happened Bosnia, the German representative that was killed? We do not have all the facts yet. I was briefed early this morning on it, and obviously I am profoundly concerned for the diplomat and the people that were on the aircraft and their families.

I had a talk with the Secretary of Defense about them the day before yesterday, and I think we have to, first of all, analyze each and every one to see whether there is some pattern that would require some kind of review by the Air Force or whether it is just an unfortunate stream of coincidences that they all happened at the same time. I noted one that I learned about this morning involved Air National Guard planes, for example. That may or may not have anything to do with any problem with planes or anything like that. I would not over jump to conclusions about this.

But now, thanks to the foundation we have laid, America has the tools to protect people all the people. And you know, as we have done on from day one, my administration is making it easier than ever for Americans to access these tools. free vaccines and boosters, free at-home tests, high-quality masks. And for the latest information about the level of ENTITY spread in your community, you can get that immediately. Now, you will also be able to find our new test-to-treat locations, which I announced in my State of the Union Address. These are pharmacies and other places in your neighborhood where you can get tested. And if you are positive, you can get lifesaving treatments all in one stop. We have already stood up 2,000 test-to-street sites test-and-treat sites across the country. We are also nearly at we have nearly 200 sites just to serve military families and veterans communities as well. We have done what we have done throughout the pandemic, we have ensured there are these locations are at the hardest hit, hardest to reach communities as well. No longer will Americans have to scour the internet to find vaccines, treatments, tests, or masks. When I took office about 14 months ago, the pandemic was raging, the economy was reeling, and the deficit was soaring. We did not have enough vaccines. enough vaccines for every American months ahead of schedule, effective treatments, at-home tests that are free and accessible. Over 99 percent of our schools are open again. 6.7 million jobs. And by the way, we did it while cutting the deficit, the largest 1-year deficit reduction in American history. But none of that happened by accident. We were able to do it because we coordinated across the Government, partnered with State and local leaders, Governors on both sides of the aisle, and the private sector to leverage every resource we had to fight against this virus. We left no stone unturned.

We are already seeing the consequences of congressional inaction. The monoclonal antibodies take monoclonal antibodies, for example. They have helped save lives. But Congress has not provided enough money to keep purchasing these monoclonal antibodies. We have had to cancel planned orders and cut the supply we are sending to the States. Without more funding, we will start to run out of them by the end of May the end of May. We have also had to scale back our plan to purchase more preventive therapies for Americans who are immunocompromised, critical tools to protect the most vulnerable among us. Without more funding, we risk running out of the supply by this fall. The same is true of testing. It took months to ramp up our testing capacity. The Omicron we saw how vital and with Omicron, we saw how vital it was and * we have enough tests on hand to weather the surge. But without funding, we are not going to be able to sustain the testing capacity beyond the month of June. And if we fail to invest, we leave ourselves vulnerable if another wave of the virus hits. Look, on vaccines and most important tool in this fight we are also running a risk. Yesterday the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, authorized a fourth shot for those 50 years and older. We know boosters are critical to providing an additional level of protection. That is why I plan to get my second booster today right here after I am done speaking. If you have not gotten your first booster, please do not wait. Those who are 50 and older, as well as those who are immunocompromised, can now get it get even more protection than they have from the initial first doses. We have enough supply to give booster shots to those newly eligible individuals. But if Congress fails to act, we will not have the supply we need this fall to ensure that shots are available, free, easily accessible for all Americans.

But I do think that we want to make sure that after people have played the game that they are going to be OK. And I am glad to see that the NFL is starting to take this seriously. I understand that Commissioner Goodell has authorized $30 million to the NIH to help study issues of how we can prevent concussions.

If you combine those things together, then we can not only reduce our deficit, but we can continue to invest in things like education and research and development that are going to help us grow. So I am not hearing you say, read my lips, no new taxes. You think there is going to have to be additional revenue over the next four years. There is no doubt we need additional revenue coupled with smart spending reductions in order to bring down our deficit. And we can do it in a gradual way so it does not have a huge impact. And as I said, when you look at some of these deductions that certain folks are able to take advantage of, the average person cannot take advantage of. The average person does not have access to Cayman Island accounts. The average person does not have access to carried interest income where they end up paying a much lower rate on billions of dollars that they are earned.

{"id": 2027, "text": "I have got several important issues in Russian-American bilateral relations, which we will, of course, discuss. But first, let me come back to the events which happened 65 years ago. Now, Russia is, of course, a country which lost more than 20 million people; Russia proper, 70 percent of the losses of the USSR. And it is self-sufficient to say Second World War and Russia. What do you tell your children, for instance, about the Second World War? Well, we have personal connections. My grandfather fought in World War II. He was part of Patton's army. And my great uncle, my grandmother's brother, was one of those who liberated Buchenwald, and so obviously, those memories are very important. And the May 9th commemoration in Russia is so important because it reminds us of the extraordinary sacrifices that the then-Soviet Union made and the strength of the alliance between the U.S. and the Russian people. In fact, our current Ambassador in Moscow, Ambassador Beyrle, his father briefly fought with the Soviet ENTITY. He was part of U.S. operations there, was captured, escaped into the Soviet Union, and ended up fighting with the Soviet Union ENTITY for a time. And that, I think, symbolizes how the joint Allied efforts helped to defeat fascism, and it is one of the most important military alliances of all time. Now that we are into reset, given today's certain responses, which are the common enemies of today? Well, obviously, terrorism is one of them. Immediately after the tragic events in Moscow, I called President Medvedev and pledged that the United States would work in any way that Moscow thought made sense in helping to find the perpetrators of this terrible act. We just recently had an attempted terrorist act in New York, and it is a signal, I think, that whether these activities are happening in Moscow or they are happening in New York, that countries have to work together to make sure that these terrorists are apprehended, that their networks are destroyed, that their sources of financing dry up. And no single country is going to be able to do that on their own; countries are going to have to work together. And that is something that I am very much looking to increasing cooperation between the United States and Russia.

But one of the things that President Medvedev and I have discussed is how can we really ramp up our commercial, our trade, our economic ties. How can we help to promote the innovation agenda in Russia? What are we doing around high-tech industries that can produce jobs and raise standards of livings for both the Russian people and the United States? And that is an area where I think you are going to see a lot of work and a lot of cooperation. One of things we are very excited about is we set up a Presidential commission with 16 active groups on everything from energy to high-tech. And I recently extended an invitation to President Medvedev to visit the United States in late June. And one of the things we hope he is going to be able to do is not just visit Washington, but also travel, for example, to Silicon Valley and see how the connections between universities and venture capital and business has been able to create some of the extraordinary inventions that all of us use today. Now that you mentioned the START Treaty, when are we going to ratify it? My hope is that we ratify it this year on our side and---- Well, I'd like to see it happen before the election. Obviously, it is technical, and I think it is appropriate for the Senate to examine it, but we are going to be putting forward the text of the treaty, the annexes, all the necessary materials before the Senate in short order. And our hope is, is that they will be able to review it quickly and recognize that this is an important step in the efforts of both the United States and Russia to meet our obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty to lower our stockpiles, at the same time as we work together to hold other countries accountable on obligations regarding the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

That principle has been embraced by a lot of countries. And there are countries like South Africa, for example, that had gone fairly far down the path of developing a nuclear weapon and decided this did not make sense for us. North Korea and Iran are two outliers, countries that have insisted on flouting international rules and U.N. Security Council resolutions, are not cooperating the way they need to with the IAEA. And so I have been very heartened by the cooperation that we have seen so far between the United States, Russia, the other members of the P-5-plus-1, in terms of imposing the kinds of pressure and sanctions that are necessary to get Iran to choose a more responsible path that will lead it back into the heart of the international community. Having signed the treaty, and having carried out several other things within the reset framework agenda, we have achieved a better mutual understanding. How can you convert it into something of a substance in such particular area as European security? Because also, NATO is a solution for those countries which are in, but NATO is not a solution for self-sufficient countries like Russia. Well, President Medvedev has put forward some ideas about a new security architecture in Europe. We are examining them. I take them very seriously. But I think that the most important thing at this point is to work with the institutions we have to see if we can rebuild the trust that for some time had been lost. So, for example, I have been supportive of NATO-Russia consultation in a much more systematic way than has been observed over the last several years. My sense is, is that all the parties in Europe, all the members of the NATO alliance, want to have a strong, cooperative relationship with Russia. a respect for territorial integrity of internationally recognized borders, a belief that a country's core sovereignty includes its ability to choose how it allies itself, a rejection of the notion of spheres of influence, whether it is U.S. spheres or European spheres or Russian spheres.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsergeybrilevrossiyatv", "title": "Interview With Sergey Brilev of Rossiya TV", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-sergey-brilev-rossiya-tv", "publication_date": "06-05-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

It has to do with an integrated economy in which if you see a crisis in Greece taking place that can affect world markets. These are all issues in which cooperation rather than antagonism are the order of the day. And I think President Medvedev recognizes this. I have been very impressed with him. I find it very easy to do business with him, and I think we have established a relationship, a real trust that can be hopefully bearing fruit in the negotiations and conversations that we have in years to come. I will use this opportunity now that you mentioned Greece and the economic crisis. I had a free day yesterday preparing for this interview, so I went fishing to Maryland.

Even more important is the fact that more and more Russians are adopting Russian children in Russia. But then, still, 17 kids have been killed--or, well, died in this country. It is an issue, especially after this American woman sent Artem Saveliev to Russia. Well, first of all, obviously, what happened with the small number of children who have been adversely affected is terrible. As you point out, there have been tens of thousands of Russian children adopted by U.S. families. The overwhelming majority are leading happy, healthy lives. But ultimately, the policy has to be what is best for children, whether they are living in Russia or they are living in the United States. What we have done is to set up a bilateral discussion between our State Department and counterparts in Russian to find out how do we create an agreement in which children are protected.

As you know, ENTITY, this is the eve of Nowruz, the Iranian New Year. What is your message to the Iranian people as they face tough economic circumstances and infringement on their freedoms? Secondly, that the people of the United States respects the people of Iran, that we respect the traditions of Iran, the great history of Iran. We have differences with the Government, but we honor the people. And we want the people to live in a free society. We believe freedom is a right for all people and that the freer the world is, the more peaceful the world is. Please do not be discouraged by, you know, the slogans that say America does not like you, because we do, and we respect you. What do you say to the regime, sir? What would you say to the regime? I'd say to the regime that they have made decisions that have made it very difficult for the people of Iran. In other words, the Iranian leaders, in their desire to, you know, enrich uranium, in spite of the fact that the international community has asked them not to, has isolated a great country. And that is, verifiably suspend your enrichment, and you can have new relationships with people in the U.N. Security Council, for example. And it is just sad that the leadership is in many ways very stubborn because the Iraqi-the Iranian people are not realizing their true rights. And they are confusing people in Iraq, as well, about their desires. And you know, it is a tough period if-in history for the Iranian people, but it does not have to be that way. On the nuclear issue, sir, is there a solution to the problem that would both satisfy the United States concern and, at the same time, allow Iran to proceed with nonmilitary nuclear energy research? Well, part of the problem is that it is very hard for people to trust the Iranian Government because they have not told the full truth, and that is why the people of Iran have got to understand there is great suspicions right now, not only in the United States but around the world.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsetarehderakhsheshvoapersiannewsnetwork", "title": "Interview With Setareh Derakhshesh of VOA Persian News Network", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-setareh-derakhshesh-voa-persian-news-network", "publication_date": "19-03-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

I believe in civilian nuclear power. Iran is a sovereign country, and they should have it. The problem is, we just do not trust the Government because they have not been forthcoming about their enrichment of fuels to go into the reactor. And therefore, Russia's offer to provide fuel on a contractual basis and provide fuel on a consistent basis would help solve the problem. And that is, the Iranians would not need to enrich; they would have fuel for their reactor; and the people would have cheaper electricity. And I support that idea. Sir, would you allow enrichment inside Iran if there are guarantees and international supervision? In other words, I- you know, once you-once a nation has not told the truth, it requires a lot of work to convince people that they will be telling the truth in the future. And my problem is, is that the Iranian Government has not been forthcoming, has not fully disclosed their programs like the IAEA asked them to. And the better way forward is for there to be a contractual, solid obligation to provide fuel for a nuclear reactor, and then the Iranians can have their civilian nuclear power. At a time when Iranians are going through very difficult economic circumstances-there is high employment, high unemployment; there are high prices; there are unfilled promises-the United Nations Security Council just passed a new set of sanctions against the regime. Is the United States concerned, sir, that the regime might exploit these circumstances to whip up anti-American sentiments, and also to use those and misuse them? No, I appreciate that. We are always concerned about the individual. You know, I am concerned about the mom trying to raise her child in a hopeful environment. And I am concerned about a child wanting to gain the knowledge so that he or she can realize her God-given talents. And of course, we are worried about the human condition.

One of the problems we do have in Iraq is the-there is been some negative Iranian influence, such as the exportation from Iran of certain weapons that have been used by extremists to murder and to kill people. Now, look, I understand Iraq and Iran are going to have relations. After all, they have got a long border. But from my perspective, Iran has not been helpful in terms of helping this young democracy survive. I would think it would be in Iran's interests to have a peaceful neighbor. They had been at war at one time with Iraq. I would believe that a peaceful Iraq would be in the long-term interests of the Iranian people. And yet it is hard to have a peaceful Iraq if there are elements inside the country that are trying to use violence and murder to continue to stir up sectarian doubts and raise concerns which will cause more violence. Yes. and they feel that this will undercut their position and that would strengthen the regime's hand. What are your thoughts on that, sir?

And Mrs. Rabin said she was rather disappointed that you failed to mention her husband during the East Room ceremony last Friday. How do you respond to that? Well, you know, the agreement is actually supposed to enter into force on the third anniversary of his passing, of his killing. And I think that if, in fact, it does do so, it is a fitting thing, because none of us would be here if it had not been for him. He really started all this in a profound way. I know that the Madrid conference started before his election, but it was his conviction and his strength and security that he conveyed to the people of Israel, I think, that made this whole peace process possible. And I never do anything in the process that I do not think about him. ENTITY, from the tragic assassination to the current situation, Prime Minister Netanyahu might put himself at the same risk as Mr. Rabin. So perhaps it is unjustified to put pressure on him to follow the Oslo accord or the Oslo track. Well, I do not think there is any question that the Prime Minister has put himself at some physical risk in pursuing the peace process. But I believe that it is important that the people of Israel know that, at least in my opinion, it is a good agreement; that it strengthens Israel's security needs; that the agreements made with the Palestinians are fully consistent with Oslo. And the Prime Minister worked very, very hard to advance Israel's security interests. Just for example, there was the whole issue of what should be done with the people whom Israel believes have committed acts of violence and terrorism against Israelis. And I am convinced that the Palestinians will now act against these people in a way that is consistent with the agreement and that will meet the Prime Minister's and Israel's needs. So that is an example of a whole array of security advances that were embedded in this agreement. And I think all Israelis who support the peace process should support the agreement because I think it furthers the cause of peace. ENTITY, is it really the PNC, the Palestinian National Council, that is going to convene to revise the Palestinian covenant with your presence?

And some are outside the PNC. But among other things at that meeting, we will seek a clear renunciation of the offending parts of the charter and a general endorsement of the agreement, this whole agreement, so that the process can be seen to be going forward with the support of those who represent grassroots Palestinian opinion. The Prime Minister wanted me to support this provision, this effort, and he fought very, very hard for this, as did a number of members of his Cabinet who were there, because they thought that there needed to be a debate in a Palestinian forum, even if it was controversial and heated, which would give to the Palestinian people some evidence not only of a commitment to follow an agreement but of a changing of the heart, an opening of the heart of the Palestinians toward the Israelis. And I thought that argument had a lot of appeal, even though it was not without its hazards for Mr. Arafat. Because it is been 18 months since anything big has happened, and because there is a lot of-he has his problems, too, among them the fact that the standard of living for most Palestinians is lower today than it was when the peace process began, because the enemies of peace keep interrupting the flow of normal life. So I agreed that if it was that important to Israel and Chairman Arafat were willing to try to accommodate that condition by the Israelis, that I would go to Gaza and address this group and ask them to support the peace and to renounce forever the idea of animosity toward and opposition to the existence of the state of Israel, and instead embrace the path not only of peace but of cooperation. I want to ask you about your visit to Gaza. Do not you think, ENTITY, that this trip may be seen as a first step in recognizing an independent Palestinian state?

That is not what I am doing in going there. The Prime Minister wanted me to go there and wanted us all to make this pitch. I asked them if they would make some joint appearances and if they would both make the same speech to Palestinian and to Israeli audiences. And they said they would do that. It would help the Palestinians to see Yasser Arafat saying the same thing to the Israelis he says to the Palestinians. It would help the Israelis, I think, also. And it would be a good thing for the Prime Minister to be able to give the same speech-whatever they decide to say, just say the same thing to both communities so that no one thinks that there is any evasion or shading or anything. I think, just little things like this to open up a little awareness of the other's position and build a little confidence, I think would be quite good. ENTITY, why will not you release Jonathan Pollard? Well, I agreed to review his case and to take the initiative to review it. I have not released him in the past because since I have been ENTITY in the two previous normal reviews-that is, the ones that were initiated by his request for clemency-the recommendation of all my law enforcement and security agencies was unanimously opposed to it. But the Prime Minister felt so strongly about it-and I might say, every Israeli Prime Minister I have dealt with on every occasion has asked me about Pollard. But you argued pretty-you had pretty harsh exchanges with Netanyahu, reportedly, about that? I thought then, I believe now, and I think the public opinion in Israel bears this out, that it was in Israel's interest to do this agreement on its own merits because it would advance the cause of Israeli security and keep the peace process going. I think there is been a lot of reporting about this with which I do not necessarily agree. That is no criticism; I just want to tell you my perception. Bibi Netanyahu argued strongly for Pollard's release. He made the arguments that anyone who knows a lot about the case and thinks he should be released would make.

And I would ask you all to remember, when evaluating reports that tempers were frayed or strong language was used-now, remember, the three of us, Mr. Arafat and Mr. Netanyahu and I, we were there for over 8 days. Most nights I was there, I went home at 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning. The last time we were there on this last day, I was up for 39 hours and so were they. Now, I am amazed that we did not have more disruptive conduct and more harsh words, given how exhausted and frayed we were.

And this Pollard issue was very important to him. But I took no offense at that. But still, ENTITY, there were many reports that you were very upset with Mr. Netanyahu and were quoted saying that his behavior was despicable. And this is the first opportunity I have had to say that. There was a moment in the negotiations when the two guys split apart, and there was an issue raised that I thought was wrong. And I said so in very graphic terms. But I never used the word despicable to describe the Prime Minister. I did not do that. There was a moment where I thought-there were various moments in these negotiations when I thought-at least from my perspective, trying to be an honest broker-they were both wrong. You would expect this over 8 days. But at that moment, the issue at stake had nothing to do with Pollard. It was an issue, a dispute between the Palestinians and the Israelis; it had nothing to do with Pollard.

I have many Jewish Americans working for me here, and they all knew how close I felt to Prime Minister Rabin. And we were-everybody was sort of coming up with ideas. And Shimon Peres later told me that he had not seen those two words used together before because chaver, it is sort of a special word; it goes beyond normal friendship. And one of my-I wish I could say that I knew enough Hebrew that I came up with it, but one of my staff members suggested that I say it.

And I think always when I am pushing the peace process forward that I am doing it not just for myself but maybe also a little for him. And I must say, in these last negotiations I was very pleased to see that Prime Minister Netanyahu-I saw in his eyes, I could almost see in his eyes the moment when he really made the decision that, well, maybe the Palestinians were going to make sufficiently specific security commitments that would be on a sufficiently clear timetable that he could sell not just to the Israeli public at large but to a decisive portion of his own constituency, which is a very different thing, as all of you know better than I do.

But do you think that you were the victim of a failure of intelligence in a way? It is the same intelligence that caused the United Nations to pass resolution after resolution after resolution. It is the same intelligence that was used by my predecessor to bomb Iraq. I am very confident we got good intelligence. And not only that, Mr. David Kay, who went over to kind of lead the effort to find the weapons or the intent of weapons, came back with a report that clearly stated that Mr. Saddam Hussein would-had been in material breach of Resolution 1441. In other words, had the inspectors found what Kay found, they would have reported back to the United Nations that he was in breach, that he was in violation of exactly what the United Nations expected him not to do. We will find the truth. But this guy for many years had been hiding weapons, deceiving weapons. He had dual-use programs that could have been sped up. Not only was he a danger to the free world-and that is what the world said; the world said it consistently-he was a danger to his own people as well. Remember, we discovered mass graves with hundreds of thousands of men and women and children clutching their little toys, as a result of this person's brutality. But in terms of-did you feel, in terms of if there was not a failure of intelligence, that there was a sort of exaggeration in what was predicted? I mean, did you ever believe that stuff, for instance? Did you ever believe that stuff about him having weapons of mass destruction that could be unleashed in 45 minutes, or did you never really believe that? But you did not believe that.

And in order for-at the very minimum, in order for a multinational organization to be valid and effective, something has to happen other than resolutions. And when an organization says, If you do not disarm -in other words, in order to say, They do not disarm, intelligence convinced a lot of nations, including France, that he had weapons. In other words, he had to disarm something. If you do not do that, there will be a serious consequence. A serious consequence, in this case, was removing Saddam Hussein so that his weapons programs would not be activated. And David Kay found evidence of weapons programs. He found some biological weapons-evidence of biological weapons. And it does not take much time-- But we really need the big discovery, do not we? Well, that is pretty big, what I just told you. Now remember, for a long period of time, it was assumed that he did not have a nuclear weapons program. And yet, after 1991, the world had to- changed its attitude about this man's nuclear weapons program and admitted that it was very advanced. A nuclear weapon in the hands of somebody like Saddam Hussein, particularly given the lessons of September the 11th, 2001, would be a horrendous development. And we had to deal with him. And we did-in a way, by the way, that was a compassionate way. We spared innocent life. We targeted the guilty, and we moved hard and fast. And very little of Iraq was touched in toppling Saddam Hussein. Did we, in fact-people have said, ENTITY, as you know, that the same meticulous planning that went into winning the war did not go into winning the peace, and we were a bit unprepared for some of the surprises, the unpleasant surprises, you know, the terrorists and all of that that came along.

What has happened is that in a relatively small part of the country, there are Ba'athist-- You call it now the Ba'athist Triangle. And they are attacking not only coalition forces; they are attacking innocent Iraqis, because what they are trying to do is stop the spread of progress. Well, I would call it a desperate attempt by people who were totally in control of government, through tyrannical means, to regain power. This is nothing more than a power grab. They have got a different mission. They want to install a Taliban-type Government in Iraq, or they want to seek revenge for getting whipped in Afghanistan. But nevertheless, they all have now found common ground for a brief period of time. And what we will do is, we will use Iraqi intelligence; we will use Iraqi security forces-we are up to about 118,000 Iraqi folks in one type of uniform or another securing the country-to be a integral part of chasing these killers down and to bring them to justice before they kill innocent life. But it must have taken us a bit by surprise, or otherwise we'd have prepared for it, the level of this-the combination of the, what, 700, perhaps, foreign terrorists who came into Iraq, and so on. We have been there for 7 months, David, which seems like a long time, particularly giving the news cycles the way they are. I am certainly not complaining about the news cycles, but nevertheless, there is a certain sense of impatience that has now crept into the world. And my job is to enable our operators and military to make adjustments necessary to succeed. We have got the same strategy, which is a peaceful Iraq. The tactics shift, depending upon the decisions of the enemy. We are making progress. What they want to do is, they want to shake the will of the free world.

I mean, we are there for how long it takes to produce a successful Iraqi democracy, are we? Well, we do not think it will be years and years, because, first of all, we think the Iraqi people are plenty capable of running their own country, and we think they want to run their own country. Oh, yes-- Well, just to discuss ways to do-to assure the Iraqi people that we have confidence in their capability. See, some in the world, some in the world do not believe that Iraq can run itself.

We did the Iraqi people a great favor by removing him. So I would not be surprised that any kind of violence is promoted by him, but I do not know. All I know is, we are after him. That is one of the interesting things. I mean, nobody has time for a moment for Saddam Hussein.

Tyrants- if tyrants do not fear-feel like they can torture and kill with impunity, feel like they can blackmail the world, and all the world does is put out empty words, it makes multilateralism extremely ineffective. If I could take a second to remind your viewers that, obviously, not every situation needs to be solved militarily. And I would refer people to North Korea, where we have got a multilateral attempt to convince Kim Chong-il to get rid of his nuclear ambitions. We understand, just like Saddam Hussein, that he has been torturous to his people-people in North Korea are starving to death-and that weapons of mass destruction in his hands given his history, just like weapons of mass destruction in Saddam's hands given his history, is a very dangerous element. It is a dangerous-it inhibits the capacity for peace and freedom to spread. But what I have done is, I have convinced China and South Korea and Japan and Russia to speak with one voice to the North Koreans, and say, Get rid of your nuclear ambitions. We are also, at the same time, working on a counterproliferation regime that will stop his ability to ship weapons of mass destruction or a nuclear warhead to a terrorist group.

We are not going to allow the few to destroy the hopes of the many. As well, I could sense in his talk, in his feeling, that he has-he is got great trust in the Palestinian people. In other words, given the chance, the Palestinian people will develop the habits of democracy, and out of that will come a great state, a peaceful state.

I went around doing a little interview with my friends here, and that seemed to be one of the prime issues. And I just wonder, what do you contemplate happening in regards to these people? Well, I think what we are talking about is the same old problem of inflation. I am not sure that that is the best idea, because we found out when we decontrolled gasoline, the oil prices, that the price went down, not up. It encouraged more exploration and more development at the source. And maybe the same thing would happen with natural gas, but no decision has been made on that. But the people on the fixed incomes are, of course, always the ones who suffer first in inflation. Our program is aimed at bringing that down. And I have to say, not enough recognition has been paid to the fact that we have brought it down. We brought it down to single digit, where it is been for the last 3 years-double digit. And I think that we are going to continue bringing it down with the program that we have in place. That has to be-I know today a great concern of the country, and it is of ours, is unemployment and this recession. But underlying that, helping cause that, everything comes back down to the fact that we have been in the longest-in fact, the world has been in the longest sustained period of runaway inflation in world history. And we are very happy about it. As a matter of fact, we have succeeded beyond our expectations, and that is what is contributed to the coming deficit. You know, government gets a profit from inflation. If it is a sales tax, and the price of a commodity goes up, and the sales tax is based on percentage, the government's percentage goes up. In the income tax for the Federal Government, that is been the big steal, where people getting cost-of-living pay raises have been moved up into upper-income tax brackets. Today, a sizeable percentage of the normal working people in this country are up to the 50 percent bracket.

We have an Illinois farmer as our Secretary of Agriculture. And we know that this is the whole basis of any economy; has to be that. One of the things where we believe government can participate and be of help-and we are trying desperately to do this-is to encourage foreign markets, export markets, because there is no question, the American farmer can and does produce more than the people in our own country can eat, so he has to have an export market. He is been caught worse than most people in the cost-price squeeze of inflation. The cost of the things he buys, even the finished products of the food that he himself grows, when he then buys that in the form of bread and so forth in the market, he finds that he is on the low end of the totem pole when he sells that raw product, but he is paying like everyone else is, the inflated price as it is gone through the industrial processes. We do not believe that government, as we have known in the past, is the answer of a--continuing to control and subsidize the farm. What we must do with government is help agriculture get back into the market in getting a fair price for what it produces. I was doing quite a bit in the promotion of gasohol. We have had plans for many more plants here in Iowa, but the plans seem to be falling by the wayside now because of a loss of Federal funds.

{"id": 2053, "text": "I am just wondering, in regards to your new approach here on federalism, if your experience in California in terms of welfare played a major role in your thinking in changing this plan? Yes, that and all my years as ENTITY there when I saw how extravagant and wasteful it was to have to run a program where the Federal Government imposed every rule and restriction as to how you must use the money, establish the priorities. The priorities are not the same in community after community or State after State. They say, This problem Washington has decided is of this priority, and therefore most of the money must be spent here. But you can come to a community where that is not their major priority, but they do have another problem that they need to help on, but they do not have the flexibility to switch the funds. And this is what we are trying to do with the new federalism program. I could cite chapter and verse of horror stories about this and about these programs. My first veto of a Federal program, when I was ENTITY, was a program that on the surface sounded just fine. It was one of the poverty programs, and it was in a rural county of California, a project-they were going to put 17 able-bodied welfare recipients to work in the county parks, maintaining and helping to keep them clean, the parks. That is exactly the type of thing that we want to do. My veto was because under their rules, over half the budget would have gone for 11 administrators to handle the affairs of the 17 people that were going to work in the park. And I thought that was a little unbalanced, and I vetoed it, and the Federal Government had 60 days to override the veto. They did not override it when I made public why I was vetoing it. I have copies of some minutes of the National Conference of State Legislatures in a meeting that you participated in. One of the sections here is in regards to welfare, and they are quoting you as saying that one of the major reasons for keeping welfare at the Federal level is the likelihood that differing benefit levels among the States was based on a court ruling handed down while you were ENTITY of California. Do you recall that? And it said the courts had struck down the State residency requirements for welfare because it was a Federal program. The ENTITY implied that if the Federal Government got out of the program, residency requirements might be acceptable to the courts.

It is true that the welfare standards vary, based on-and this is under the Federal domination of the program-so these people who say, Well, this State might cheat and not give as much as another State, are talking through their hats, because that is the present situation. But the Federal Government insists on minimums that are based on percentages of what is a basic cost of living in the various areas. But because Federal money was involved, the States had residency requirements so that you had to legitimately be a citizen of that State in order to get welfare. When the Federal Government-the court-on the basis of the Federal funds, struck that down, you found people just going shopping. And there was a great influx, not only into California, New York City-that was when its great problem developed. People only saw the end result of the amount of money that was being paid. They did not translate it into the added cost of living, of living in those places. Theoretically, you were not supposed to be better off in one State or the other, that the lower amount was because of the lower cost of living in that area. But today, our idea is to find out if this is a part of what they want, to get the help of the State and local officials in fleshing out this concept that we have created in turning these programs back. So we are quoting here in regards to Medicare-the suggestions made here. Under consideration is a voucher system for Medicare. This-although here we are still in the early stages of trying to find a better method of providing the needed care for-Medicare is the program for the older; Medicaid is the program that we have suggested the Federal Government take over instead of giving back and to find a way of doing it that will maintain the funds that are needed for people with a true illness or injury and not the waste, the shocking waste that we have today. For example, I can give you a case-let us say this is not in Medicare or Medicaid-that has just come to us, a man who told the story himself.

Now, we think there are better ways to run a railroad. Shifting gears here a little bit, a lot of people seem to be picking your budget apart in terms of the money that you want to spend on the military. Why are you so strong in your support of this additional spending? I am strong for military spending for this reason. In the last several years before this administration, the military was literally starved. Even with our military buildup, we will not even be back in the range of ability to stand in the face of our adversaries, the Soviet Union, until the mid-eighties. We will still be below them no matter how much we do now. But the truth is we are only spending about 6 percent-our military budget is only about 6 percent of the gross national product. In years past, in the fifties and the sixties, this averaged over 9 percent with the military budget. And even in the peace years, without the Vietnam war or the Korean war, it was over 8 percent, almost 9 percent. So, in point of history, we are not up to what used to be considered the normal peacetime budget. But we have to show our adversaries that we have the will to defend ourselves.

We think they have been able to get away with this because we have been unilaterally disarming for the last several years. When they see that we mean it-I think a cartoon told it all the other day. There was a cartoon that showed Brezhnev talking to a Russian general and he was saying, I liked the arms race better when we were the only ones in it. By them, obviously you are talking about the Russians. It just dawned on me, one of my colleagues here wanted me to ask you if you have ever been in the Capitol before. I do recall sleeping out on the lawn. I am old enough to remember when air conditioning was only found in motion picture theatres, and on some of those hot Iowa nights, this Capitol lawn out here would literally be covered with whole families that would bring a blanket and come over to the lawn and sleep all night around the Capitol lawn from all the residences around here. Swinging back here, would you favor moving up the 10-percent cut in Federal taxes from July i to some time in the spring? I would be very pleased to see that, because I think it would be beneficial, except that those who are proposing it are then proposing in return that we cancel the third year's cut. Now unencumbered, just a simple move up, yes, I would favor that. I think that one of the things that could have mitigated if not prevented the present recession is if we had gotten our original request. We originally wanted a 10-percent, not a 5-percent cut, retroactive to January 1st of 1981. And I think if that had been in place, there might be a different situation with regard to the recession. As it was, to get the bill we had to cut to 5 percent on the first installment and delay to October 1st in order to get passage of the bill. Many economists are predicting that the economy is going to start turning around in the second quarter. If it does not , what will you do? Well, I think we are going to begin to see turns then. The regrettable thing is that the last to recover is unemployment when you are coming out of a recession and that is our major problem today-the people that are without jobs. So we believe that our program that is in place of cutting the cost of government and reducing the percentage that government takes in taxes is the answer.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithskipwebertheiowadailypressassociationdesmoines", "title": "Interview With Skip Weber of the Iowa Daily Press Association in Des Moines", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-skip-weber-the-iowa-daily-press-association-des-moines", "publication_date": "09-02-1982", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

The spirit of your Prime Minister, talking about overcoming the difficulties to become a free society, is-was just wonderful.

And I can understand why citizens, particularly if they did not feel threatened by Saddam Hussein, would say, We do not like war, and we do not agree with what ENTITY decided. And I know that. But now they have got to see what is happening in Iraq. Eight million people voted in the face of terror.

First of all, war is a terrible thing. And a lot of Europe supported the decision to enforce the United Nations resolutions. Remember, this was not a U.S.-you know, this came about as a result of the United Nations passing 1441, which said-and by the way, the 16th resolution to Mr. Saddam Hussein that said, Disarm, disclose, or face serious consequences. He chose not to do either, so he faced serious consequences. And a lot of Europe supported the decision to go and have him face serious consequences because the international body, the United Nations, needed to be credible when it spoke. And the Eastern Europeans were great friends on this subject, and it is interesting. They understand what it means to live under tyranny. They know what it means to have secret police. And they began to smell that great freedom that comes, and then all of a sudden, democracies began to emerge.

To that extent, yes, we are going to do that. But for the future, we have to bring down the percentage of the gross national product that government is taking in this country. See, I have a degree in economics myself. But I do remember that when I was getting my degree, it was more or less a standard acceptance in economics that the business cycle, so called, and the lean periods previous to that are-what we now call recessions and depressions-when they did occur, that usually it was when the government had gone beyond a certain point in the percentage of gross national product that it was taking. And that was just more or less accepted as standard. And I think that after we get what we have called a down payment, which is about all we can get in this year, with the limited time that Congress is going to be here, then I think, in a bipartisan way, we are going to have to continue to look at government, as to how, structurally, we can reduce the share that government is taking. Can you give us an idea, though-I mean, could you give us some specifics about what you might do? Well, let me give them to this extent. Some of them you could look at, and they could be contained in the Grace commission-or committee reports. Here was a look at government by almost 2,000 top business leaders in the private sector-not only from institutions and so forth but from the business and financial world-that looked at government as they would look at a business if they were thinking of merging or taking it over-as to things that are wrong or that could be changed. And we are really seriously looking at these recommendations, 2,478-or -28?-but anyway, it is almost 2,500 recommendations that they have made. And many of them would require legislative action, because they would result in changes in procedure in the processes of government.

So, you are saying you have not even put forth a proposal yet? You have not, even yet, put forth a proposal in these negotiations? Well, this is in our own discussions within, I might say, the family, meaning the Republican leadership, both the House and Senate and myself.

Do you agree with that? No, I think everything that we have done in our economic approach is of benefit to everyone. I know that there are charges being made-I listened to the debate-that somehow our attempts at economies and all have penalized people who were dependent on government aid. The simple fact of the matter is we are spending more on help for the people and for the needy than has ever been spent before in history. Our budget cuts have been reductions in the increase planned in spending. We have not come to some place where we are spending less than had been spent.

Do you think that all the campaigning among eight contenders for the Democratic nomination has changed public perception of you along those lines or along other lines on Well, even before a campaign started, this has been pretty much the theme of the other side. I have been held up as eating my young, that we have been hostile to the poor and our tax program benefits the rich. How can a program that cuts taxes evenly, percentagewise, across the board-thus leaving the same rate of progression in our progressive tax system-how can that be beneficial to the rich and detrimental to the others? How can it be unfair to the people of lower income or the poor to reduce inflation from double digits-12.5 percent when we came here-down to a third of that or less, less than a third of that. When the people with the least-let us take someone with $10,000 of income between-through 2 years, 1979 and 1980-before we got here. By the end of 1980 that $10,000 would only buy $8,000 worth. He was getting $5,000 a year. He got a $1,000 cut in his ability to buy each year. That was probably the worst tax on the elderly with fixed incomes, the worst tax on the poor who have to spend most of their earnings on subsistence, on the necessities. The person with luxury income who spends a minor portion of it on necessities and the rest on luxuries, they were not really penalized as much by inflation. So, I think everything we have done has been beneficial to everyone at every level. You mention the elderly. If I could ask about that. The large elderly population of Florida-and they-many voters seem to be convinced that you, more than the Democrats, have been trying to restrain the growth or cut back entitlement programs such as social security and medicare.

You cannot suddenly undermine them or break your contract with them. Reforms, if there are such to be made, must be made, looking toward the future, on people not yet dependent and who would have plenty of time and warning with regard to such changes. Again, this was-if you will remember, that was the issue of the 1982 campaign. We were guilty of trying to tell the Congress and our opponents that social security was facing financial disaster and it could hit it as early as July 1983. They denied that. I remember hearing the Speaker of the House, himself, deny that that was true. And then after the election was over, we all got together in a bipartisan group and without any animus, came up with a plan to save social security because it would be broke by July of 1983. And we came up with that program. It was not a permanent answer to some of the problems, but it did buy us a great many years down the road before we would again be in the fiscal spot of that kind. Now, as to what we have done in social security since we have been here, the average married couple on social security has had a $180-a-month increase.

And now, 4 years later unemployment is hovering around 15 percent, and the coal industry and the steel industry are ailing, and some Federal programs that West Virginians have depended on have been cut. What would you say to the guy in the street in West Virginia to convince him that he should vote for you in 1984? Well, first of all, we know that unemployment is never consistent with the national average.

Well, that is what the enterprise zones are all about, picking those hard-hit spots, both rural and urban, and generating employment through the use of tax incentives. And so far, a number of States have gotten tired of waiting for the Congress to act and do it at a national level, and have put in their own enterprise zone programs. And every one of them is proving tremendously successful. But, knowing that you might get around to unemployment, I just decided some figures might be of interest to you. You represent two, four, six, eight States-and all in the same region. In every one of them the figures for the peak of unemployment, and the figures for-I cannot give them to you except for one State now-but in December, as of the December level of the comeback, were considerably down from the peak. And in the State that you just mentioned, your own, at the peak, unemployment in West Virginia was 21. By December it was down to 15.7. We will not know for awhile, because when the Labor Department gives you the overall statistics, they do not break it down to States at the present figure. It takes them awhile to break it down as to States. So, all I have are the November figures, except for Florida, and that is because they do break it down for the 10 most populous States earlier than they do for the rest.

And that means that newcomers coming in, without jobs and looking for jobs, are temporarily going to distort the figures. Back on the economic issue for just 1 minute, back to the budgetary thing-when you campaigned for ENTITY, one of your promises, of course, was to balance the budget by 1984. I wonder what you look at as the main reason for that. What happened to Reaganomics that made it not work like you wanted it to? Nothing happened to Reaganomics. And I am glad you asked this question. Yes, I had the help of some of the finest economists in the country in working on the program that I call the economic recovery program. And toward the end of the summer, 1980, I announced that plan, and based our projections-that, yes, it could balance the budget by '83, based on all the projections that those economists at that time-before the election. Between that announcement and November, that projection was no longer valid, because the economy in 1980 was deteriorating so fast, and had not been projected to do so by any of these notable economists. So, it continued to worsen, and by the time of the Inaugural-then even a later time-was beyond any prediction; it had continued to get worse. Inflation, then, for '79 and '80 had been double digit both years. Now, when I started-you have got to remember that the ENTITY comes in not with his own budget. You are still bound until the following October by the budget of the previous administration. Nor was my program in effect. We were still trying to get it. And in July of 1981 was when the further big dip came. Now, some economists have said, well, we had a 1979, '80 recession, and then the thing that happened in July was another-a different recession.

And then, as our program was implemented-and remember, it was only implemented in stages. It took 3 years to get the 25-percent tax cut. Other things that were implemented-and we never got all of the spending cuts. As a matter of fact, we got a little less than half of what we asked in spending cuts. And that is to this day. Now, I could turn around and say that maybe the recovery might have been even better if we had gotten-remember that one stage of our tax cut-10 percent of it-was going to go into effect retroactively to January of 1981, and we did not get it then. And when we did get it, after the drop had occurred, it was only 5 percent, and it did not go into effect until October, which meant that it was about 1 1/4 percent when it only went on for 3 years-or 3 months. And so, I have to say that all of the recovery has taken place after our program went into effect, and none of our program was in effect when the bottom fell out.

Are you saying that you have abandoned altogether any hope of reaching any kind of compromise with the Democrats? Are you through talking with them?

I would like to think that they would do it. But what I meant was that to sit down with them and start from scratch to negotiate, they were very unwilling. We had great difficulty getting them to even meet. And, finally, one meeting they just simply walked away on one issue and refused to talk. And it was not very encouraging to us.

And that is not exactly the picture that is come from some of your advisers, if we do not take control of the deficit immediately. And some of the economists-and some of them, I think, are trying to scare the Congress into recognizing that we should be dealing with it. Not scare you, but the Congress. Not scare me, no, because, look, I am not one to underestimate the deficits. I have been talking about them for 30 years. Is it impossible for us to-well, no, you cannot remember; all of you are too young, so it would have to be history for you-but for almost half a century the other party has been in control, as I said earlier, of both Houses of the Congress. And Congress is the only one that can deal with these things. A ENTITY has a veto power, but ENTITY cannot spend a single dime. There is nothing in the Constitution that gives ENTITY the right to spend anything. But for almost this half-century we have every year run deficits. It was almost a trillion dollars by the time we came here. And there were many of us who opposed this. And we were told at the time that the national debt did not matter because we owed it to ourselves. We were told the deficit spending and a little inflation was necessary to maintain prosperity. Well, some of us did not think that added up. And I can show you speeches I made 20, 25 years ago in which I said inflation cannot continue without going out of control eventually. You cannot go down this road. The deficit spending and the piling up of the debt that-it has never worked in history; it never will. Well, now, suddenly, with the big dip that came in July in that recession, with millions more people added-the unemployed, who became wards of the government, which increased the spending, but who were no longer paying the taxes, which decreased that; the very fact that we improve the inflation figure also militated against government revenues, because inflation is a source of tax increase.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsoutheastregionaleditorsforeignanddomesticissues", "title": "Interview With Southeast Regional Editors on Foreign and Domestic Issues", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-southeast-regional-editors-foreign-and-domestic-issues", "publication_date": "12-03-1984", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Well, all of this, for them now to suddenly become aware of deficits-and yet, when you try to talk to them, what is the only answer that they have for curbing the deficit? Well-and they will also agree to cut defense spending. Well, defense spending right now is down to a little more than a fourth of the budget. Defense spending, historically, the days of Jack Kennedy, was virtually a half of the budget. Under Jack Kennedy, it was 47.8 percent. So, the-and the increase in taxes-they doubled taxes in the 5 years before we got here. And the deficits increased, because when you increase taxes, they increase spending. And may I point to the 1983 budget resolution passed by the Democratic majority in the House. And they really did not think that it would ever amount to anything or be passed by anyone else. But, if you will remember, they described it as a reaffirmation of Democratic principles. And it did call for somewhere around $70 billion in increased taxes. But it also called for that much increased spending for new programs, social programs. So, this was where we philosophically just were in complete disagreement-that they think you can solve the budget deficit by increasing taxes. They do not even pay attention to the fact that this could subvert the recovery that we re now having and put us back where we were. But beyond that, they have made it plain, and, indeed, their own candidates talk of new spending programs. When you are oh the campaign trail, how much of an issue are you going to make of the school prayer issue and the abortion? Well, I am hoping that before I get out there that we will have the school prayer amendment passed in the Congress. And here again, the effort that is being made to portray that as someway, somehow we are talking compulsory prayer; we are going to compel the schools. I am sure there would be some schools-all we are asking is that they have the right to if they want to. But I think it is a right that we had for the bulk of our entire history in this country.

There is a lot of reports, including administration reports, that there are more illegal drugs coming into this country than ever, especially cocaine-much of it coming through Florida-despite intensified enforcement in Florida and elsewhere. Would you say that that represents a failure of that drug strategy?  Well now, wait a minute-I am going to have to ask, but-you know, I have to tell you something about this room. I do not know whether you have noticed it or not-out there in that center of the room under the dome, you kind of disappear a little on me. I am having so much fun. I was asking about the illegal drug shipments into the country. And the evidence is that there is more illegal drugs coming in than ever before-at least in recent years and despite intensified enforcement in Florida and other places. And what I am wondering is whether you think that because of that that there is going to be a need to change the drug enforcement strategy, and whether the drug enforcement strategy that you have employed has been a success? Then this-if this is a new figure that I have not obtained-our task force in Florida, which is the first time that we have ever put the Federal Government, the State government, and the local authorities, the drug enforcement authorities, and the military involved in trying to head this off-this shipment from out of the country coming in-was so successful in Florida that this is where, why we went to 12 such task forces all around the country on our borders to try and have the same success. When you have got the coastlines that we have got and the borders that we have, I do not think you will ever solve the problem totally by intercepting the drugs. The answer is going to be the kind that has Nancy down in Houston. To really be successful, you are going to have to take the customer away from the pusher. And this we are embarked on also, as you know, with great efforts all through the country. But the figures that we have is that-and the reason for the rest of the other 11 task forces were-that we so slowed it down in Florida and reduced it in Florida, that they began seeking new entry points around the country.

It is not just a fellow on a corner with something in his pocket to sell. It is coming in in freighters. It is coming in in airplanes and everything else. But we have stepped up our efforts and have been tremendously successful. Do you think the military can be used to stop, like, particularly some of the drug smuggling that is coming in on that Mobile corridor? What we used was we used their radar facilities; also their air surveillance for information that we needed. I do not think they actually participated in any of the arrests, but they provided the surveillance and the information for us. If they can see an enemy coming in, I can see that. I had just one final question for you related to defense. This year for the third year now you are requesting in your defense budget funds for chemical weapons production. And of course, Congress has narrowly defeated these proposals for the last 2 years. There is been a suggestion made in the last week by some Democratic House Members that any proposal for funding for chemical weapons should be tied to legislation requiring the administration to make a new initiative on talks with the Soviets on chemical weapons control. So, my question is, first, do you think that the United States is doing all it can in this area? Would you agree to a proposal like that? And also, do you see any reasons now why Congress might be willing to pass the chemical weapons appropriation when they have not been? If they were responsible, they would, because the very thing that they are talking about we are going to be ready very shortly to table a treaty for discussion of banning chemical weapons. But the reason why they would be more of help if they would okay the spending is, how better to get the other side, then, to agree to a treaty with us banning this; how much better able we will be if they know that if they do not do that, they will have to face the fact that we have chemical weapons that we can use against them.

This will be your first trip to our country. What feelings are you traveling to the Soviet Union with, and what do you anticipate from this upcoming summit meeting? Well, this will be the fourth meeting between the General Secretary and myself. I am obviously looking forward to the trip for one reason, because I have never been there. And I am looking forward to seeing your country-well, as much as possible with the meetings that will be going on. And we have discussed in the previous meetings with your General Secretary such matters as arms reductions, and we have been successful on the one treaty. such things as rescue-at-sea agreements, fisheries agreements, things of that kind in which we have made great progress. At Geneva, in Reykjavik, in Washington, you and Mr. Gorbachev took steps which have great significance. Thanks to that, the threat of war has been reduced and cooperation has increased between our countries, despite the different social systems we have. What kind of opinion do you have about future prospects for movement in this same direction? Well, I have to be optimistic about it. I have read Perestroika cover to cover, and the goals that were outlined there for your own country and by your present leader were such that I think it would reduce some of the differences between us further and make it possible for future leaders of our countries to eliminate-well, what I called for in our first meeting in Geneva, when just the General Secretary and I were talking to each other, I pointed out that we did not mistrust each other because we were armed, we are armed because we mistrust each other, and that we had a unique opportunity, the two of us, to go to work not just to try and reduce arms but to reduce the causes of the mistrust.

A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Well, I would think that once-I think the weapons that are the most destabilizing are the nuclear weapons, the idea in the minds of people that once those weapons are fired devastation is going to follow and there is no way to halt them. They are more destabilizing than the people's concern about weapons that we are familiar with-airplanes, battleships, things of this kind, artillery. But then if we continue to work out our differences and a better understanding, then I think we engage in the reduction of conventional weapons. ENTITY, since we have already touched on the question of nuclear weapons, I would not like to seem pessimistic, but I get the impression that in Moscow there will hardly be an opportunity to sign a treaty about 50-percent reductions of strategic nuclear weapons while observing the ABM treaty. Still, despite that, what are your attitudes about the prospects of concluding such a very, very important treaty for the world? Well, I still think it can be concluded, but it would be, I think, overly optimistic, with the time limitations, to believe that it could be ready for signature as the INF treaty was here in the previous meeting. It would be nice if we could have achieved a signing ceremony there on this visit, but this treaty is far more technical and complicated than the treaty we did sign. And so, the experts on both sides who have been working on this in Geneva have not been able to make the progress that was made in the earlier treaty. And I think that perhaps we can advance it in our conversations, discussion, in Moscow on this. But we must-the idea is to continue until we have the treaty that is correct, and not simply try to meet a date and sign a treaty that might not be all that we would desire. I do not think either of us have gone this far with the idea that it was not a good idea. ENTITY, I'd like to ask you a sort of personal question.

Our systems are different, we are going to be competitive in a number of ways, and that'll continue, but we can be competitive without being hostile to the point of conflict with each other. And I think this is what we are aiming at. And no, I could not have foreseen your present leader. Well, new times bear new leaders, bring about new leaders.

ENTITY, I cannot help but ask you a question which is very interesting to Soviet people, many ordinary people in our country. You, in your speeches, many times have quoted the works of Lenin; you have made reference to his works; you quoted him about expansionistic aims of Soviet Communists. Soviet specialists, insofar as I know, in the U.S. press and people who work in the Library of Congress have studied all of the compositions of Lenin's, and they have not found one similar quotation or anything that is even close to some of those quotations.

Now, as I say, I cannot recall all of the sources from which I gleaned this, and maybe some things have been interpreted differently as in modern versions, but I know that Lenin expounded on that and said that that must be the goal. But I also know-and this did not require reading Lenin-that every leader, every General Secretary but the present one had, in appearances before the Soviet Congress, reiterated their allegiance to that Marxian theory that the goal was a one-world Communist state. This man has not said that. So, I was not making anything up; these were the things we were told. For example, here in our government, we knew that Lenin had expressed a part of the plan that involved Latin America and so forth. And the one line that sounded very ominous to us was when he said that the last bastion of capitalism, the United States, would not have to be taken; it would fall into their outstretched hand like overripe fruit. I'd like to say that, as it says in the Bible, everybody wants to go to paradise, but nobody is proposing to do that-anything for us or to hurry up the process. Everything has to go by in its own time; that is our point of view. Well, would not you think, though, that these two systems obviously were competitive in the world with each other in the economic situation-industry and so forth, the difference between private ownership and government ownership of the sources of material, industry and so forth, agriculture-well, would not you think that it would make the most sense to compete legitimately, as business firms compete with each other, and see which does the better job? Without question, when we talk about the fact that we think that sooner or later that the world is going to come to socialism, we are just talking about a historic process.

And then we have this one thing in which possibly we differ. And that is that we believe the people of a country have the right to determine what form of government they will have. You have a constitution; we have a constitution. The difference between our two constitutions is very simple; it is contained in three words. Both of the constitutions announce things for the people's benefit and so forth. Your constitution says, these are the privileges, rights that the government provides for the people. Our constitution says, we the people will allow the government to do the following things. And the government can do nothing that is not prescribed by the people in that constitution. And so, where we run into conflicts sometimes in countries where there is a stirring and a division in trying to determine a government, our view is, the people must have the right to say this is the government we want. It must not be imposed on them. ENTITY, in that connection I'd like to say that democracy is, of course, a great goal for all peoples. But if you take a specific situation now-social opinion in the United States, the polls and Congress and so forth-Congress is against actions that are being taken in Nicaragua.

Of course, you must remember that each Congressman is elected only by a district-his congressional district. This is the only job in our country that is elected by all of the people.

Individuals are going to have prejudice and so forth. But we have laws in our country that make it law-breaking to implement those prejudices and to try to do things unjustly to other people. You have to remember one great difference about our country. A man put it to me in a letter once. And that is that you could leave here and go to France to live, but you could not become a Frenchman; or you could go to live in Germany or Turkey or-name any country-you could not become one of them; this is the only country in the world in which anyone from any corner of the world can come here and become an American, because that is our history. We came from every corner of the world.

As a matter of fact, my own background, going back to grandparents and great-grandparents, covers four different countries-but here in this melting pot. So, the result is that the people that came here came not only with the desire for freedom, but they also brought with them many of the prejudices that existed because of national differences between various countries. People may have and do have-there are people who have a prejudice against someone of another faith, someone of another background or race. But if they do anything to hurt that person because of that prejudice, the law takes care of them. I think that in terms of human rights, lately, a lot has been said.

I was quite interested recently when the General Secretary, meeting with the leaders of your Orthodox Church, lessened some of the restrictions that government had imposed on the practice of that religion. Well, I have wondered if a further expansion of that-you see, our country came into being because people were being denied, in other countries, the right to worship God as they saw fit. And so, they left those countries and came to this new land as pioneers in order to worship. Well, I have just wondered if there is not a field there in your own country for more openness and the allowing of people to practice religion in the ways they chose.

The majority of Presidents in this country, when they left office, write memoirs. Are you getting ready to write your memoirs when you leave office, and if so, when are we going to get a chance to read your memoirs? Well, I have been thinking very seriously about writing a book. In view of the fact that several people who have left government have written some books, I think maybe I better straighten out the record and tell things as they really are. People, not government, voluntarily provide money and funds and build what is called a Presidential library and museum, and this is happening with me. There is a group in the country; they have raised the millions of dollars. In California will be built this structure. Now, in that building will be the millions of papers from this administration. They will be open; scholars can come and study them and research and so forth. And there will be also many things that will be of interest to the people-memorabilia that we have accumulated here. And this has happened with all the Presidents in the recent years.

Since time is up, more or less, I'd like to thank you for this interview, and I'd like to wish you huge success in your upcoming mission. May I just say one thing also-in going to your country, and I would relish the opportunity, if I could, to say a few words here-that is never discussed very much. I have a great admiration for the women of the Soviet Union, particularly in the Russian area. From the outside looking in, they seem to be a great bulwark of strength and solidity in the maintaining of the home and the things that they stand for-the standing in lines to bring home what is necessary for the family and all of that. And I just wonder if they are getting the credit within your country that I think they deserve. They deserve it. They do not just stand in lines, but the majority of them work together with men. They teach, they take care of children, they work in administrative posts, and so forth And I hope that with your own eyes you will be able to see all of that when you come to our country. Well, you have said it better than I did, but, yes, I recognize all of those things and just wondered if they get the recognition they deserve within their country. Well, I am pleased, and I welcome you and enjoyed it very much. And I appreciate greatly the opportunity to speak to your people. They were telling us all the time that we should finish up, but I guess we ran over our schedule. Tell ENTITY there is an interpretation coming through, so I guess you understood what I said. But I want to say to you that this interview will be broadcast on the eve of your arrival-I think the 27th of May. I have the impression that you will be able to see it, because the 27th, I think, you are going to be in Helsinki, and you can see Soviet television in Finland very well. And it is going to be on one of our channels. There are going to be about 200 million Soviets that will see this interview, and it will be broadcast all over Eastern Europe, as well. So, everything that you said will reach all the Soviet people, and I think it will be a good beginning for your visit to the Soviet Union.

{"id": 2081, "text": "A lot of people think it is the right medicine at the right time to get these talks moving toward a favorable agreement with the Soviets. But part of our position requires the Soviets to destroy, do away with, nearly two-thirds of their heavy missiles. Do we have any signs, any indication, inkling that they will go for this feature? Well, both sides, according to our proposal, are going to have to do away with some of their weapons. I think what you are referring to is a thing-on which we can be very flexible-and that is whether there is a sub-limit. I doubt very much that there will be much of a problem about the mix of weapons. The whole-our whole aim is a reduction in the number of missiles for both sides to the 5,000 limit and a reduction in the destructive power. This is another place in which they are superior to us. Do you detect a new spirit of compromise in the Kremlin, especially since Ambassador Harriman's trip? The thing that makes me hopeful is that the Russians, who so many times just simply say nyet to everything, they did in previous meetings propose a lower figure than they presently have. We are willing to come up from the figure that we had, as I indicated yesterday, and so if one's the Moon and the other's green cheese, maybe we can meet some place in between. ENTITY, is it possible or is it now probable that you might have a summit meeting with Mr. Andropov between now and, say, next summer? The only thing-there is no reluctance on my part to have one, except that there is a great danger if you have a meeting simply to have a meeting and get acquainted, and then everyone says, What happened in the meeting? I think we have to have an agenda. And I think it has to be one in which both sides have agreed that they are really going to try to settle some of the issues between us. July 1st, a Federal tax cut is scheduled to take effect. In the past week, Speaker O'Neill has been demanding that a ceiling be put-a $700 ceiling be put on the maximum amount that any taxpayer can receive under this cut. He apparently wants to soak the rich or the wealthiest taxpayers more. Are you going to tamper in any way with this tax cut?

{"id": 2082, "text": "And I'd like to point out that this whole thing about whether-soak the rich or something else-he had set the figure at $50,000. Under his proposal, a married couple that have a $35,200 income would find that their top bracket now is 33 percent. It would go to 37 percent under-or it will be 33 percent when the tax cut goes into effect. At $48,000 and something, the same married couple would find that they go from 38 percent up to 42 percent under his proposal. And this is not up to the $50,000 mark, and they are losing money. Seventy-two percent of all of the tax relief in this coming tax cut on July 1st will go to people below $50,000. Now, when you stop to think that with our graduated income tax the top 10 percent of earners in this country pay 50 percent of the total amount of tax and the top half, the top 50 percent of earners pay 93 percent of the total tax, I think it is only fair that a tax cut goes across the board, even Steven, the same percentage cut for everyone. Your top budget people are warning that the money supply is growing too fast, and there is a fear, at least among some of them-Stockman and Feldstein-that we could be headed for more inflation. Are you worried about that at this point? Not really, because I think that there is no question the market's been a little frightened by a surge there. And probably what makes them worried about that is the 1980-before we got here, there was a giant surge, and that was the one that took us up to 21.5 percent interest rates and so forth. And then the string was pulled very firmly-1981-bringing it down. In fact, if that string had not been pulled for so long and so hard, we might not have had the depth of recession that we have had. But it is a kind of an uneven thing. It is not something that you can actually specify and say it is going to grow exactly at this amount-the money supply. The Fed has immediately moved on that, and I do not anticipate that. Sir, speaking of the Fed, will it be Mr. Volcker continuing, or might it be Mr. Greenspan? Can you give us any clue?

Under the recommendations of the Commission which you appointed on Excellence in Education, part of the recommendation is for the Federal Government-all levels of government-to help finance this. Are you satisfied that local governments can, in fact, find the money it is going to take to implement the longer school days and the back-to-the-basics curriculum that the Commission recommended? Well, the Commission report also made it plain that just throwing money at it is not the answer. Right now, the highest tax finance program in the United States is public education-some $215 billion. And incidentally, it has increased over the last 20 years, when everyone is so concerned about the decline in education, funding for education has increased by 600 percent. And in that some period, allowing for inflation in constant dollars, we have added a $66 billion increase in constant dollars over that same period in the per capita cost for each student. But what is necessary is to work out Federal, State, and local, and what are the proper functions for each to perform in education, and then have the responsibility of funding those. At this moment, the Federal Government only supplies 8 percent of the total educational budget, and yet, one of the problems has been that over the years the Federal Government for that 8 percent has wanted about 50 percent of the control of the schools. I feel good, thank you. You seem ideally suited to a man who would be up for reelection. Can you give us some idea of what your thinking is on seeking a second term right now? Well, my thinking, basically, is that it is far too early for anyone of my position to announce his intentions. And I can tell you why. If I did, and the answer was no , then it would not do me any good to ask Congress for anything. And if I said the answer was yes at this point, the media-forgive me-but the media, very largely would be tagging everything I did, including a trip to Minneapolis, as political in nature.

We have one in Redondo Beach that Cal State-Fullerton was involved in; one at Newport Beach with Hughes Electric, G.M. Hughes; one in Torrance-two in Torrance.

Joining us now to talk about what is called the first wave of the Technology Reinvestment Program grant is the author of the plan, more or less, president of the United States, ENTITY. Thanks for joining us today to talk about what we here in San Diego call the defense conversion. Can you give us kind of a short definition or explanation of what it is you want to accomplish here? Yes, we are trying to take the capacities, the skills, the technologies that were developed in the big defense build-up of the 1980's, and instead of just letting those technologies and the abilities of those people go to waste, we want to give them a chance to be used in the commercial sector in a way that helps both national defense by keeping that skill and that technology alive and helps to rebuild the domestic economy and to create jobs. Today we announced the first of what will be four announcements between now and the end of November in the technology research project, which involved 41 projects from California to Maine from former defense contractors or current defense contractors using technologies in defense for domestic purposes. In San Diego, the University of San Diego and Muller International and a company called Trans-Science Corporation are using the composite materials developed for the Stealth aircraft to build and repair bridges. And they are working on a bridge in San Diego now. And this is just one of, as I said, over 40 projects. California got a large number of these projects but so did several other States that have been hurt by base closing and defense cutbacks. They were all given out on the merits, I assure you, and now what the companies have to do is to negotiate with our defense conversion projects to make sure that the Government and the companies all put up a fair amount of money.

We have invited three top YouTube creators here to the White House today, we are in the East Room, and they have set up their own YouTube sets right here in the White House for a very special YouTube video with a very special guest, ENTITY of the United States. Now, they have been asking their millions of subscribers on YouTube what they should ask you in today's interview. None of those questions has ENTITY seen before. And we have also been taking a look on Google at what Americans were searching for during your State of the Union address. So ENTITY, this is data that we have collected anonymously across all of Google searches in America, top questions that people asked during your State of the Union speech included, what is middle class income? People also want to know stuff like, how much does ENTITY make? What does the speaker of the House do? So these are things that are on people's mind as they watch your speech. Next, we sort of backed up and looked at the issues. So of all the issues you addressed during the speech, which issues were Googled most during your State of the Union? what was the most asked question on Google during the first 10 minutes or so of your State of the Union? You can see this huge spike as you begin your speech, and then, you know, throughout, people very curious about how old you are. Well, let us get straight to the interview. We will show you more Google trends throughout the conversation today, but let us get right to the questions. I want to introduce you first to ENTITY of the Vlog brothers. I am only going to get one shot at this. I do not think I am going to get a lot of chances to interview ENTITY, so I am going to jump right in. Let us do it.

So there is some areas where, I think right away we can get some cooperation. There is some areas where it is important for us to frame the debate and get the American people behind us, because even if something does not happen immediately here in Washington, it starts having an impact around the country. A great example of that is the minimum wage. I called for the -- a rise in the minimum wage last year, and Congress still has not passed it yet. But in the meantime, you have got 17 states, you have got cities and others that are raising the minimum wage. And so, it creates movements that ultimately, you know, change things in Washington, as well. So, you used the phrase, middle-class economics ... in the speech, which I think is a -- is an idea that we needed a phrase for. But when I first told people I was going to be able to come talk to you, a lot of them expressed that they felt like the government was never going to have their interests at heart because the government existed to protect the interests of corporations and business. And the thing that they use is -- like, the prime example of this is taking former leaders of industry and putting them in positions where they are regulating the industries they used to be in charge of. And do you understand where those people are coming from? You know, look, I understand people's skepticism and cynicism. On the other hand, think about a bunch of stuff that government does do. I mean, since I have been in office, we have been able to take away money that was being siphoned off by banks in the student loan program. And billions of dollars are now suddenly going directly to students to make it easier for them to finance their student loans. You know, simple stuff that we often take for granted, like Social Security or Medicare for -- in the case of many of your viewers -- your -- their grandparents.

It is -- I do not have a lot of... it is just crazy that I have to do this. I am going to keep my questions -- my answers as short as possible. I -- I appreciate you doing that. I will try to zip through it. So, I feel like whenever a new weapons technology is developed, we spend five or 10 years sort of coming to understand the full implications of that new technology. And sometimes, we look back at those initial years of its use as... like we maybe misused or overused that technology. Are you at all worried that your administration is going to be seen as a time when drone strikes were a technology like -- that we see as over or misused? Well, you know, basically, drone technology came into its own right when I first came into office. We have tried to put a series of constraints on how it is used. But understand that our goal has always been, how do we target very specific terrorists who are, you know, proven to be trying to kill us? Or, more frequently, kill innocent Muslims in their home countries? And how do we do that with -- with as little damage to the surrounding communities and innocent people as possible? You know, part of what is really tough for me as commander in chief is the fact that any kind of war is damaging. Any kind of war results in casualties. And, in fact, the sort of damage that may have taken place with a drone strike is always significantly less than if I ordered a raid into a village where a high-value terrorist target was. So, you take the bin Laden operation in Pakistan, for example. You know, there were some people killed in that operation. And the truth of the matter is that anytime we are going after terrorists who are embedded in communities, there are dangers there. Do we have a legal framework? And a set of controls on it?

But it is -- it is something that we take very seriously. And I would argue that today's technologies can enable us to defend ourselves, causing less damage to those communities than in the past. Sort of along those lines, there is a lot of bad things happening in the world, but I feel like none more so than the kind of generations-long oppression and even genocide that is been happening in North Korea. We recently, you know, implemented new sanctions against North Korea because of a cyber attack against us. I was surprised to find that there were any sanctions that we could sanction that had not been sanctioned yet. I feel like, as the strongest nation in the world, like it feels wrong that such injustice could exist in the world. No, look, North Korea is the most isolated, the most sanctioned, the most cut-off nation on earth. And the kind of authoritarianism that exists there, you almost cannot duplicate anywhere else. And as a consequence, the country cannot really even feed its own people. I mean, we keep on trying to ratchet it up a little bit higher. Over time, you will see a regime like this collapse. Our capacity to effect change in North Korea is somewhat limited because you have got a million-person army and they have nuclear technologies and missiles. That is all they spend their money on, essentially, is on their war machine. And we have got an ally South Korea right next door, that if there were a war would be severely affected. We will keep on ratcheting the pressure. But part of what is happening is the environment that we are speaking in today, the Internet, over time is going to be penetrating that country and it is very hard to sustain that kind of brutal authoritarian regime in this modern world.

And in places where it is been legalized, everything's doing OK. How do we move forward out of this legal gray area weirdness? Well, what you are seeing now is Colorado, Washington, through state referendum. They are experimenting with legal marijuana. The position of my administration has been that we still have federal laws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. But we are not going to spend a lot of resources trying to turn back decisions that have been made at the state level on this issue. My suspicion is that you are going to see other states start looking at this. What I am doing at the federal level is asking my Department of Justice just to examine generally how we are treating nonviolent drug offenders. You know, what we have done is instead of focusing on treatment, the same way we focused, say, with tobacco or drunk driving or other problems where we treat it as a public health problem, we have treated this exclusively as a criminal problem. And I think that it is been counterproductive, and it is been, you know, devastating in a lot of minority communities. It presents the possibility at least of unequal application of the law. Now, the good news is, is that we are starting to get some interest among Republicans, as well as Democrats, in -- in reforming the criminal justice system. We have been able to initiate some changes administratively. And last year, you had the first time in 40 years where the crime rate and the incarceration rate went down at the same time.

Cybersecurity is a huge issue we have been working on since I came to office. And in fairness, the administration before me probably was starting to work on it. Although the changes in the media have happened so fast and so much stuff is going online today that it becomes that much more important. The challenge we have got is that most of the Internet and the infrastructure that allows you to be posting on YouTube and people accessing your stuff, most of that stuff's in private hands. It is not in public hands. And so what we have to do is to work with private companies telling them here is what we are seeing, here is how you can protect yourself, here is how you should share information with other companies who start seeing hackers getting into their stuff so that everybody can pool the information and we can all protect each other together. And it moves very fast because these hackers are -- you do not have to have a lot of equipment in order to be able to do this hacking. In fact, the hacking against Sony, which we believe was done by North Korea, it was not even that sophisticated. So we continue to do more with private industry, to share with them best practices to how they can protect themselves. It is sort of like with your own ATM machine -- ATM card or your pass code, your passwords, your personal privacy. So we are sharing that information with them. But what we are also asking Congress to do is pass a law that would give us more tools to fight against this in the future. And I am confident that this is something we can actually get some good bipartisan support for. People are going to still be able to watch your show, I promise.

{"id": 2091, "text": "And it is not like regular folks. How can we bridge the gap between black, African- American males and white cops? Well, first of all, we always have to just remind ourselves that the overwhelming majority of police officers, they are doing a really tough job and they are doing it well. And they are doing it professionally. What we also know is that there is still biases in our society that in split-second situations where people having to make quick decisions that studies have shown African-American males are seen as more threatening, which puts them in more vulnerable positions. And so a lot of the way to solve this is to improve training so people can be aware of their biases ahead of time. And when I was in the state legislature back in Illinois, for example, I passed a racial profiling bill. It essentially said how are we going to tackle this problem? Let us make sure we are keeping track of the race of everybody that was being stopped. And just by the small fix of keeping track, suddenly each cop when they were about to make a traffic stop they had to think, OK, am I stopping this person because I should be stopping them? Or is some bias at work? And just that kind of mindfulness about it ended up resulting in better data, better policing, more trust by the communities that are affected. And we can do some of that same stuff and use those same tools. I have put together a task force with police and community activists, including some of the young people who were actively involved in the Ferguson protest to make sure that we come up with what are the best training practices, what are the best tools, more body cameras on police officers so that they know they are being watched... And we are going to take some of those recommendations and we are going to put federal muscle behind them to see if we can make sure the communities all across the country are implementing them. Well, it'll be -- it is something that I think everybody, not just African-Americans or Latinos, but everybody should be concerned about... because you get better policing when communities have confidence that the police are protecting and serving all people and not in any way showing bias. And that is something that we should all have an interest in. I grew up in Florida... And I have a lot of friends, close friends, who are Cuban-American.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegrovedirectornewslabgoogle", "title": "Interview with Steve Grove Director of News Lab at Google", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-director-news-lab-google", "publication_date": "22-01-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 2092, "text": "And I have heard the stories of their families escaping... and some of them did not even make it to come to the United States for a better life, to get away from the Castros. I mean, the guy puts dic in dictatorship. So I am trying to understand how do you justify dealing with the Castros? We have had the same policy since I was born, which was we were going to have an embargo. We were going to cut off all contact, all communication. And you know I have said this before. When you do something over and over again for 50 years and it does not work, it is time to try something new. And we started off initially by allowing more travel to Cuba by Cuban-Americans to visit their family, sending more money back to their family members to help them back in Cuba. We have been doing that for the last four or so years. And it turns out it is been helpful to the people in Cuba. They have more contact with their family. It gives them more hope. Now what we are saying is that by normalizing relations we are going to be able to still put pressure on the Cuban government. But also what happens is now you have got more visitors to Cuba. You start getting telecommunications into Cuba. You start getting the Internet into Cuba. And over time what you are going to see, gradually, is a shift. Because not everybody in Cuba's able to escape to the United States, and the goal ultimately is to make sure that there is freedom in Cuba, not just for the folks who have left. This is dependent on the Supreme Court ruling, but do you think that same-sex marriage will be legalized in all of United States during the time that you are in office? And what can you do to push that along? Well, we have done a lot, obviously, to push it along. I announced my belief that same-sex marriage should be legal that people should be treated the same. We argued against -- as an administration before the Supreme Court we argued against the Defense of Marriage Act that was treating married couples, same-sex couples differently in terms of federal benefits. The Supreme Court now is going to be taking on a case. My hope is that they go ahead and recognize what I think the majority of people in America now recognize, which is two people who love each other... and are treating each other with respect, and are not bothering anybody else, why would the law treat them differently?", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegrovedirectornewslabgoogle", "title": "Interview with Steve Grove Director of News Lab at Google", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-director-news-lab-google", "publication_date": "22-01-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 2093, "text": "So as a consequence I think that I am hopeful the Supreme Court comes to the right decision. But I will tell you, people's hearts have opened up on this issue. I think people know that treating folks unfairly, even if you disagree with their lifestyle choice... the fact of the matter is they are not bothering you. Let them live their lives. And under the law they should be treated equally. And as far as me personally, you know just to see all the loving gay and lesbian couples that I know who are great parents... You know the idea that we would not treat them like the brothers and sisters that they are, that does not make any sense to me. You are almost done with me, and your time as ENTITY. With the time left, what would you hope your legacy is? Well, we saved an economy that was on the brink of depression. We have created 11 million new jobs. We have doubled clean energy. We have reduced pollution. We have made sure that more young people can go to college. We have given now so far 10 million people health insurance that did not have it before. And that is going to grow over time. You know we have ended two wars in a responsible way. But we still have challenges. Every day I wake up and I ask myself in particular how can I make sure that folks who are working hard can, not just survive, but how can they thrive? And so in the State of the Union that I just gave we talked about how can we provide more help for young families with childcare, huge burden on a lot of people? And what I want to do is make sure that the first two years of community colleges are free so that young people can you know have confidence that if they go and try to get more skills that they are not going to be paying through the nose in terms of a lifetime of debt. You know I want to make sure that we are doing more to raise the minimum wage and providing paid sick leave. So there is a lot of basic stuff that we can do that would ensure the economy goes strong, but more importantly that everybody benefits from a strong economy. And that is going to be my focus over the next two years. But hopefully it'll be one in which I am making sure that everybody in this country can succeed.

{"id": 2094, "text": "You'd be interested to know that traditionally when people were searching on Google for stuff around college the number one question they asked was what should I bring with me to college. So in the past couple years the number one question has become how to pay for college. So clearly a topic that a lot of people want to know more about. And to tackle that question and many others we have a very popular YouTube creator next, ENTITY. So I am very excited to hear your answers so I am just going to dive into the questions. So my first question for you is regarding education. A lot of my friends are the same age as me, as well as my online audience. And a lot of them are now going to college or are already in college. So my question for you is how can -- what do you think is the best long-term plan for making education as a whole more affordable for students? First of all, college remains the best investment you can make. If you want to do anything right now in this 21st century economy, you are going to be measured by how much knowledge you have and how adaptable you are to changing circumstances. And college, it is not just that it gives you a particular skill, but it also teaches you how to learn you know for your whole life. And you know so it is the key to the future. One of the things that we have done is to make sure that more young people have access to Pell Grants, more people have access to student loans that are lower interest rate. Now I have proposed to make community colleges free for the first two years. And that is a good option for a lot of young people. There're four-year colleges, but a lot of times you can go to a community college for your first two years and then transfer your credits and go to a four-year college. But you have already gotten your first two years free. And we know that it is already working in places like Tennessee. We want to take that all across the country. And then what we have done is we have also said once you get out, if you have got some debt then we want to be able to cap how much you pay back to 10 percent of your income. So that if you decide to become a teacher or a social worker or some helping profession that does not pay a lot, you do not feel like well I cannot do that job because my debt burden's going to be too high.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegrovedirectornewslabgoogle", "title": "Interview with Steve Grove Director of News Lab at Google", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-director-news-lab-google", "publication_date": "22-01-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 2095, "text": "But the single most important thing for your viewers is number one, you will be able to figure out a way to pay for college. You got to know ahead of time how much does a school cost. If they tell you well, we will help you finance it, do not worry, you have got to understand you are going to be taking on some debt. And what is it going to look like once you are finished. You should have some sense of whether you can get in- state tuition versus going to a school out of state because there may be a big difference in terms of cost. And one of the things we are also doing is seeing if we can get more high schools to work with their local colleges so that while you are in high school you can start getting some college credits. That may make it quicker for you to get your college degree. And you know the quicker you get your degree the cheaper it is going to be. My next question I actually relate to on a very personal level because when I was younger I was cyber bullied, which affected me in a very big way. So I went online and I basically spoke about my story, which then a lot of my viewers online came to me leaving comments and asking for tips and advice on you know how I dealt with it. And obviously you know I can give them tips based off of my experience. But sometimes I feel like I reach a point where I just cannot help them as much as I would truly love to. So my question for you is how can we prevent that, prevent bullying in schools and online? Because it is something that happens on a daily basis. Well, I have got to say this is one area where I think your voice is more powerful than ENTITY of the United States you know because peers are going to have more influence than anybody. And when they see young people like you who are willing to speak out and say that is not right and protect other people from this kind of bullying, cyber bulling or any kind of bullying. That is what changes people's minds. That is what has an impact on them. Suddenly it is like oh I guess it is not so cool for me to do that because... somebody I respect or somebody who is like me is telling me you know to act differently. So we had a big conference here at the White House in order to prevent bullying.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegrovedirectornewslabgoogle", "title": "Interview with Steve Grove Director of News Lab at Google", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-director-news-lab-google", "publication_date": "22-01-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 2096, "text": "And you know we had a whole bunch of organizations who came together and they were in workshops and looking at various ways of dealing with the issue. But the really most powerful testimonies came from students and young people like you who had organized themselves... and were going from campus to campus, school to school, going online and just explaining why you know that is -- you know that kind of bullying tactic is something we can guard against if everybody kind of speaks out against it and uses positive peer pressure to say that is just not acceptable. So you are already doing it. I think you have better advice than just about anybody about it because you experienced it. You felt it. So last April Boko Haram kidnapped hundreds of schoolgirls. And a lot of them are still missing. So what do you think we can do to raise awareness about this issue, and also just prevent it from happening again? Well, as people may know or may not know, Boko Haram is a radical, violent, terrible extremist organization in Nigeria. And they kidnapped 200 young women. And are -- they are in many cases still being held. What we tried to do is to help the Nigerian government to deal with the problem. The Nigerian government has not been as effective as it needs to be in not only finding the girls, but also in stopping this extremist organization from operating inside their territory. And what we are trying to do is mobilize other countries to try to give the Nigerian government more resources, not just military equipment but better intelligence, allowing them to track where these folks are, and to try to stop them. But I tell you, the more young people are engaged in issues like this and speak out and let their elected officials know that they care about it, the more attention that is paid to it. And ultimately that is how you solve these problems. There are a lot of countries that are still struggling. You know during your lifetime more people have come out of poverty and more people have been able to feel more secure around the world than probably any time in human history. And that is why it is so important for young people like you to educate yourselves about the issues and to speak out and get involved. And over time -- we are not going to solve every problem overnight. But we can have some positive impact. My next question for you -- so, I was actually just in China.

{"id": 2097, "text": "And I could not help but notice I could not access the apps and the websites that I do back home. And I just felt kind of isolated from like the online global community. So how can we make them a part of that? Well, you know China and Russia and some other countries around the world that do not have a democratic government and do not have the same traditions of free speech and open Internet, they have recognized. I think that the Internet's so powerful that if people start being able to communicate then they maybe start criticizing the government. And then they may be able to mobilize opposition. And things that are unfair or people who are being mistreated suddenly have a voice. So they are trying to keep a lid on things. And we consistently, wherever we go, insist that issues like free speech and a free and open Internet, we think that that is part of who we are as a people. We think that that has value not just in America but everywhere. We obviously cannot make laws in China. But what we can do is let them know and shine a spotlight on some of those practices and indicate to them that any government that is afraid of its own people and people just peacefully trying t speak out and voice their own opinions is over the long term not going to be as effective and as long-lasting as a government that trusts its people to be able to communicate freely. So I am going to be honest with you. Before I came here to do this interview for YouTube I never really followed politics that much. A lot of my online audience and just the younger generation do not seem as interested in it. So my question for you is why should the younger generation be interested in politics? And why should it matter to them? Well, basically politics is just how do we organize ourselves as a society? You know how do we make decisions about how we are going to live together? Well, the truth of the matter is that the reason we even have colleges is that at some point there were politicians who said you know what? We should start colleges. And dating back to Abraham Lincoln, who started something called the land grant colleges. And he understood that government should invest in people being able to get an education and having the tools to succeed. Well, you guys are the ones who are going to be using these colleges and universities. And if they are not getting enough funding from government and your tuition goes up then you have got more debt.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegrovedirectornewslabgoogle", "title": "Interview with Steve Grove Director of News Lab at Google", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-director-news-lab-google", "publication_date": "22-01-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

You know if you care about an issue like you know making sure the gays and lesbians and transgender persons are treated fairly. Well, laws on the books can make sure that they are not discriminated against. You know the environment. I am a lot older than you. And if the climate keeps on getting warmer and we have more droughts and more floods and you know the oceans start dying off. You know it is going to be you and your children who are dealing with that. We can stop it. But we can only stop it if we get together and we start using energy differently. And so there is no decision in our lives basically that is not touched in some way by the laws that we have. And we are really lucky that we live in a democracy where our voice matters. I will bet there're a bunch of your friends -- here is -- it is as simple as this. You decide you guys want to go see a movie, and you got a group of friends. And you know somehow you got to figure out which movie you are going to go see because not everybody's going to agree all the time. You are going to have to have a debate. And you are going to have to make an argument. Well, the same is true for our country. You know we have got to make decisions about which direction we are going to go in, what we are going to be doing, how we are going to spend our money, how we are going to treat each other. And you do not want to be the person that just says OK, whatever. Whatever you guys want to do, I will just do that. You want to express your voice and your values and what you care about. It is just -- it is something that people do all the time with their friends and with their family. And this is just done at a national level. And some of the issues get pretty complicated. But usually the values are the same ones that you talk about all the time. How do we treat each other with kindness? How do we look after one another? How are we fair to each other?

What did you want to be growing up? I wanted to be a bunch of different things. I wanted to be an architect for a long time. And I suppose in the back of my mind at some point I thought playing in the NBA would be great, being a basketball player. That ended around the age of 13 when I realized I was not talented enough.

You are going to be listening in on people's conversations. You know I -- so the -- I guess the flying thing. One time somebody asked me this and I gave an answer that my wife Michelle teased me. I will go ahead and tell you anyway. And I do not know if this is a superpower, I'd love to be able to speak any language. I met anywhere in the world I could just talk in their language. To me that would be really cool. I love that. I would love that too. But I do not think it'd make a really good movie. I have never heard that one before. Can you take a selfie with me? Let us do it. We had a lot of fun with it today. Thank you. this is the power of you know what the Internet's all about. You know you can create content and there is not all these barriers to entry.

And it is a great treat for me because more and more there're audiences that get turned off by the traditional news shows or the traditional debates.

You see some of these videos here flying over the map of the U.S. And we are going to try to go to as many of these as we possibly can today, and let us just get right into it.

ENTITY, I just got out of the Marine Corps infantry after serving two tours in Afghanistan, and now I am unemployed. How are you going to help people like me? As you know, we have over a million people who've now served either in Iraq or Afghanistan. All of them have done extraordinary work. And it is our moral obligation to make sure that we are serving them as well as they have served us. And so there are a couple of things that we are doing right away. Number one, the Department of Defense and the VA are working together to make sure that we have got a career counseling program available. The minute folks are getting out of the armed services, we are helping them to make sure that they know where to land, what kinds of skills are transferable to what industries. We are trying to gather up companies who are willing to hire folks who have come out of the military. These folks have shown leadership, They have been trained. They have performed at high levels, in very difficult situations. They are going to be great assets to help rebuild the country. Mm-hmm. housing, education, you name it -- that they are directed specially to making sure that these veterans are served. You know, Wayne from Artesia, California, asked -- you know, he is a -- he is a recent college graduate. How are you going to help recent college graduates like myself when there are fewer highly competitive points of entry?

We were talking about veterans earlier. Obviously, the post-9/11 GI Bill is a huge asset for making sure our veterans and their spouses are able to get the training they need. We created a million point -- a million-300,000 jobs last year in the private sector that we passed during the lame-duck session that is providing incentives to business to, you know, invest in business and equipment this year; making sure that there is a payroll-tax cut that can spur more consumer spending and economic growth. But, you know, obviously if you do not have a job right now, it is tough. And -- and -- and we have got to make sure that we are focused exclusively on economic growth over these next 12 months. A lot of these job-creation programs cost money, and a lot of Americans are worried about the debt. Let us go to Charles Wagster, who writes, ENTITY, you have all these plans to help the nation's businesses create new jobs. All these programs you plan on making will cost money. What cuts and what programs do you plan to cut in order to start reducing our debt? Well, as I announced at the State of the Union, what we are going to be doing is freezing domestic discretionary spending for the next five years. Now, keep in mind that a freeze actually ends up being a cut, because the population's going up, you end up having some slight inflation, and when you combine both increased population programs. And what sorts of things -- what sorts of programs do you think are going to get cut? Well, you know, we are going to be announcing our budget, so I do not want to give too much details, because then nobody pays attention when we actually put the numbers out.
