{"id": 5626, "text": "What a moment of hope it was 1 year ago when Central American leaders concluded their meeting in Guatemala. The Sandinista Government of Nicaragua, a Communist regime fighting a civil war against 15,000 Nicaraguan freedom fighters opposed to their oppression, agreed to a series of sweeping democratic reforms. If carried out, those reforms would have ended the killing and brought peace to Nicaragua and Central America. It would also have meant that Nicaragua would at last join the family of free, democratic nations. To much media fanfare, the opposition newspaper in Nicaragua, La Prensa, was reopened. A few political prisoners were released, and political groups were allowed more latitude. Most important, Sandinistas finally agreed to the freedom fighters' request for direct negotiations for a peaceful, democratic settlement. Now the main reason the Sandinistas agreed to those steps a year ago was the steady progress of the freedom fighters, including important battlefield victories like the one at Los Minas. But tragically, at the very moment when continued strength and determination by the United States might have meant the continued success of the peace plan, the United States House of Representatives decided, and by only a very narrow margin, to refuse my request for further effective aid to the freedom fighters. This, of course, removed the principal prod-the military victories and popular success of the freedom fighters-to Sandinista participation in the peace plan and sent an immediate signal of American weakness to the Communists. This failure to support the freedom fighters has had costly and sad consequences-just how costly and sad we have seen during the past few weeks. Communist Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega has been visiting Castro in Cuba and voicing solidarity with the tyrant who has brought so much sadness and misery to that country while in Nicaragua , a renewed attack on political dissent is being led by the head of the secret police, Tomas Borge, a dedicated Communist and grim, hardened repressor of human rights whose office, according to our Commission on Organized Crime, has also been actively engaged in the international drug trade. Acting under the orders of the Communist leaders and Borge's supervision, Sandinista police and goon squads have brutally broken up a peaceful demonstration by 3,000 Nicaraguans. Opposition leaders were jailed or beaten and now sentenced to prison. The Communists ordered the Catholic archbishop to shut down the Catholic radio station, and for almost 2 weeks the independent newspaper, La Prensa, was refused permission to publish.", "label": "monologic", "features": {"sentence_length": 27.266666666666666, "word_length": 5.2689486552567235, "sentence_complexity": 1.1333333333333333, "passive_voice_freq": 0.4666666666666667, "lexical_word_freq": 13.6, "nominalization_freq": 2.4, "personal_pronoun_freq": 0.4666666666666667, "interjections_freq": 0, "modal_verbs_freq": 0.26666666666666666, "discourse_marker_freq": 1.1333333333333333}}
