{"id": 3377, "text": "And we certainly agree with that -- not just might be, but a necessary and important step -- for the Ukrainian people because it would -- successful implementation of that election would allow the Ukrainian people to freely express their will when it comes to choosing their leader, their president. And we are very focused on ensuring, with our partners, that the election takes place. This is a small matter, but the President has a minor cold. I am not suggesting that he is ill, but here is the question -- I cannot find any public record that the President has had his full medical workup, his usual exam, since before the election. And maybe I missed it. Can you tell us, update us when -- I will have to take the question. I have not looked into that. Yesterday the FCC voted to create what they call Internet fast lanes. I am wondering, the President, as candidate in 2007, 2008, said he would oppose such efforts. Is the President disappointed by the FCC decision, or is he contemplating going back on his campaign promise from six years ago? The President has made clear since he was a candidate, ENTITY, that he strongly supports net neutrality and an open Internet. As he has said, the Internet's incredible equality of data, content and access to the consumer is what has powered extraordinary economic growth and made it possible for once tiny sites like eBay and Amazon to compete with brick-and-mortar operations. The FCC is an independent agency, as you know, and we will carefully review their proposal. The FCC's efforts were dealt a real challenge by the Court of Appeals in January, but Chairman Wheeler has said his goal is to preserve an open Internet, and we are pleased to see that he is keeping all options on the table. We will be watching closely as the process moves forward in hopes that the final rule stays true to the spirit of net neutrality. The President is looking at every way to protect a free and open Internet and we will -- and he will consider any option that might make sense. Does the rule that was passed yesterday meet the President's standards for net neutrality? Again, I think the rule -- what was passed yesterday was something that kept options on the table. Well, if you have all options on the table, then the President will be looking very closely to see that the outcome of this results in a final rule that stays true to the spirit of net neutrality, which he supports.
