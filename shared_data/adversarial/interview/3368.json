{"id": 3368, "text": "And the size of that backlog increased significantly when this administration, because our veterans deserve it, made the decision that there would be a presumption of acceptance of a claim if you were a veteran claiming problems associated with exposure to Agent Orange. That is the first time that is ever been done; that is what this administration did. If you were a veteran of the first Gulf War and you felt that you were a victim of problems associated with exposure in that war, and if you were a veteran of Iraq or Afghanistan and you experience Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, again, your claim would clear a hurdle automatically under this process that we established in this administration because we believe our veterans deserve it. That immediately increased the population of people who had disability claims added to the backlog, and that backlog has been a focus of intense work and attention by the VA and the administration in general. On the matter of the absolute requirement that our veterans get the health care and services that they deserve and they get that in a timely fashion, the revelations or at least the allegations that have emerged from the situation in Phoenix I think have been greeted, in terms of reaction in the manner that Secretary Shinseki suggested yesterday, with a great deal of anger and frustration. But these are matters -- and other issues that have been discussed in the wake of those allegations -- that are properly under review at the order of Secretary Shinseki, under investigation at the recommendation of Secretary Shinseki by the independent inspector general. And as you know, the President and Chief of Staff here have responded to Secretary Shinseki's recommendation by sending one of the President's most trusted aides over to VA to help with that review, to work with Secretary Shinseki on that review. So I think that reflects the seriousness with which we approach this matter, our concern about some of the allegations that have been made. But I just wanted to make sure that it was understood that there is a -- that the disability claims issue is not the same issue that is being discussed when we talk about the allegations in Phoenix. I think part of the confusion is when you and others have been asked about the problems in terms of veterans getting the health care that they need and deserve, you have answered with talking points on the disability claim backlog. So are you really -- I mean, are you suggesting that this is a problem that is limited to the Phoenix office?", "label": "dialogic", "features": {"sentence_length": 39.45454545454545, "word_length": 4.7695852534562215, "sentence_complexity": 3.727272727272727, "passive_voice_freq": 0.8181818181818182, "lexical_word_freq": 14.909090909090908, "nominalization_freq": 3.272727272727273, "personal_pronoun_freq": 2.8181818181818183, "interjections_freq": 0, "modal_verbs_freq": 0.18181818181818182, "discourse_marker_freq": 1.6363636363636365}}
