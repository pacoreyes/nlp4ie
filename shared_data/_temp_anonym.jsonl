{"id": 1, "text": "ENTITY, I think it would be helpful to establish some of the facts, I have a couple broader questions for you. So, number CARDINAL, yes or no, did the President direct PERSON to write this memo on PERSON? No, the President had lost -- again, like I said, he'd lost confidence in Director PERSON, and, frankly, he'd been considering letting Director PERSON go since DATE he was elected. But he did have a conversation with the Deputy Attorney General on DATE, where they had come to him to express their concerns. The President asked they put those concerns and their recommendation in writing, which is the letter that you guys have received. So it is ORG assertion that PERSON decided on his own, after being confirmed, to review PERSON's performance? And I think most of GPE had decided on their own that Director PERSON was not the person that should be leading the ORG, as evidenced by the numerous comments that we have seen from NORP members in the ORG and ORG, NORP members, members of the ORG, and people across the board. Since we are establishing the facts -- Senator PERSON said she was told something different directly from the President. The President said he asked PERSON and PERSON to review this. He asked them for their recommendation, based on the conversation that they had on DATE. He asked them to put that recommendation in writing. But they came to him on his own. And again, the President had lost confidence in PERSON from DATE he was elected. On DATE, PERSON came out and said that the President had full confidence in his ORG Director? Why did he say that? Look, I think -- again, he is questioned Director PERSON's reason for needing to stay at the ORG. He had countless conversations with members from within the ORG. Then why did the President -- -- and that is simply not allowed. And somebody like the Deputy Attorney General, PERSON -- who everybody across the board has unequivocally said, this guy is a man of upstanding character and essentially the gold standard at ORG -- when you take an action like that, when you go around the chain of command in ORG, then you have to make steps and take action to make a recommendation to the President. And that is what he did. Does it have to do with the investigation into GPE? How do you respond to those criticisms? We will come back to that, I am sure. Until you said from the podium just now that the President lost confidence in him over DATE and DATE, we had thought that this was all PERSON's doing. When was it that the President lost confidence in PERSON? I think it is been an erosion of confidence. I think that Director PERSON has shown over DATE and, frankly, DATE, a lot of missteps and mistakes. And certainly I think that, as you have seen from many of the comments from NORP members, including Senator PERSON, they did not think he should be there, they thought he should be gone. Frankly, I think it is startling that NORP are not celebrating this since they have been calling for it for so long. Do not forget, and I have another one I need to ask you, too. To follow on that, you said that he made a lot of missteps and mistakes. Back at DATE, this President was applauding the ORG Director when he reopened the investigation into PERSON emails. So he seemed quite happy with him at that point. Well, I think the President's position. CARDINAL he was a candidate for President, not the President. Once you take over leading ORG that is very different than being a candidate in a campaign. As you guys all know, there is a very clear distinction between those CARDINAL things. I think also having a letter like the one that he received and having that conversation that outlined the basic just atrocities in circumventing the chain of command in ORG. Any person of legal mind in authority knows what a big deal that is, particularly in ORG, particularly for somebody like the Deputy Attorney General, who has been part of ORG for DATE and is such a respected person -- when he saw that, he had to speak up on that action, and I think that was the final catalyst. The President is accused by NORP of trying to circumvent the GPE investigation by firing PERSON; he meets with the NORP Foreign Minister and the NORP Ambassador to GPE. He is accused of being NORP; he meets with PERSON Secretary of ORG. The timing of all of this, is it just ironic or is this the President poking a finger in his critic's eye? Look, these were meetings that have been on the books for a while. I think, frankly, the saddest thing is that the NORP are trying to politicize and take away from something that the President should be doing. He should be meeting with the Foreign Minister. He should be meeting with people like PERSON. And for them to try to attack him for doing his job, -- maybe they should spent a little more time doing their jobs, and we would not have all the problems that we do. ENTITY, is not it true that the President had already decided to fire PERSON, and he asked ORG to put together the rationale for that firing? When did he make the decision? He made the decision for -- the final decision to move forward with it was DATE. But I know that he is been contemplating it for a while. But how do you explain what PERSON says, that the President told her that he was concerned with the mess at the ORG and asked ORG to look into it? I cannot speak for Senator PERSON, but I did speak directly to the President and heard directly from him that he, again, had been considering letting Director PERSON go pretty much since DATE he took office, but that there was no request by him to have a review at ORG. But was the reason for the firing what was written by the Deputy Attorney General? Is that why he did it? That was, I think, the final piece that moved the President to make that quick and decisive action DATE. What did he mean in the letter that he wrote informing PERSON that he was being fired -- he said, on CARDINAL separate occasions PERSON had told him that I am not under investigation. What were those CARDINAL occasions that the ORG Director told the President that he was not under investigation? I am not going to get into the specifics of their conversations, but I can tell you that Director PERSON relayed that information to the President. Following up on that, ENTITY, did the President ask Direct PERSON whether he was under investigation when they were -- when they had these meetings? Again, I am not going to go into the specifics of their conversations. Is ORG concerned that -- he obviously made a decision to stick that in the letter and to make that public. Are there any concerns that it was inappropriate that they had that type of a conversation? How important was the ORG Director's failure to stop the leaks coming out of the ORG to the President? I think that is probably CARDINAL of the many factors. You cannot deny somebody -- that that was not a problem. And so I think that was just another one of the many reasons that he no longer had the confidence of the President or the rest of the ORG. Can we expect more firings from ORG? Going forward, does the President want ORG to shut down what he is called a taxpayer-funded charade investigation? He wants them to continue with whatever they see appropriate and sees fit, just the same as he is encouraged the ORG and ORG committees to continue any ongoing investigations. Look, the bottom line is any investigation that was happening on DATE is still happening DATE. And, in fact, we encourage them to complete this investigation so we can put it behind us and we can continue to see exactly what we have been saying for DATE, there is no evidence of collusion between the PERSON campaign and GPE. And we'd love for that to be completed so that we can all move on and focus on the things that, frankly, I think most of NORP are concerned with. Even if they keep on wasting taxpayer money, he wants it to continue? Look, nobody wants to waste taxpayer money. I think the President has made a priority of this. That is another reason we'd love for it to come to completion. But at the same time, I know that you all will not let this go until it does. Let us put it behind us. Let us move on, and let us focus on what we need to do to turn our country around. CARDINAL, was ORG aware at the time of this decision and announcement that grand jury subpoenas in the case of PERSON had just gone out? Do you know anything about that process? I'd have to refer you to -- And does ORG believe that if these ORG investigations are going to proceed in these allegations of NORP interference, do you support continued funding, and support who to lead that investigation? Who is going to be running that right now? Right now I believe that would fall to the Deputy Attorney General, PERSON. And we are incredibly confident in his abilities, as I believe you can tell by the rest of the ORG, including many NORP, are as well. Given the fact that he was confirmed CARDINAL to CARDINAL and had overwhelming praise from both sides of the aisle, I think there is complete confidence in him. And another reason, frankly, for Director PERSON to be out of the way so that they can have somebody leading this effort that everybody across the board has respect and confidence in. Nobody wants this to be finished and completed more than us so that we can focus on what we need to do here. ENTITY, the President said -- or excuse me -- PERSON said DATE the President has confidence in the Director. So, again, I am sorry for not understanding this, but what has happened in DATE to shake the confidence? Was PERSON lying at that point? Or did something happen in DATE? Of course, you'd love to add that in. Again, I think one of the big things that took place was the process in the hearing on DATE where, again -- not to sound like a broken record, but since you guys keep asking the same questions, I guess it is only fair that I keep giving the same answers -- but you have somebody, the Director of the ORG, who reports to the Deputy Attorney General, going around the chain of command. That is not something that is allowed in the justice system, nor should it be. That, along with the corrections that had to take place over TIME, TIME, those are all big problems and another, I think, kind of final piece that pushed the President to make the decision that he did. Does he regret not doing it earlier, like on DATE or DATE? No, I believe the President wanted to give Director PERSON a chance, but he feels that he made the right decision, certainly. Why did he do as he did it, if I could ask? Why did he have CARDINAL of his long-time security advisors hand-deliver a letter to the ORG when the ORG Director was, in fact, in GPE? Did not he deserve a phone call or a face-to-face conversation? Why did he decide to do it like that? He followed the proper protocol in that process, which is a handwritten notification. And at the same time, no matter how you fire someone, it is never an easy process, and so he felt like following protocol was the best thing to do. Does he plan to speak to him? I am not aware of that conversation. Was the President aware that PERSON asked for more resources in the GPE investigation? And did that factor into his decision to get rid of Mr. PERSON, the Director? Not that I am aware of, and I think that would be a better question for ORG. Can I ask a follow-up? On the campaign trail, President PERSON frequently said lock her up, and he criticized ORG for not being harsh enough on PERSON. He actually praised Director PERSON in DATE for having the guts to reopen the investigation. Why was he moved by a letter that said that Director PERSON was, if anything, too harsh on PERSON? Why does that move the President to fire him? Again, I think you are looking at CARDINAL very different positions. The President was wearing a different hat at that time. And again, when you go around the chain of command in ORG, when you, like I said before, throw a stick of dynamite into ORG, that is a big problem and it is one that cannot be ignored. But he already knew that, did not he, ENTITY? He already knew what Mr. PERSON had done. I think that this was -- my understanding is DATE was the first time the Director had openly and publicly made that statement and made that clear. The statement DATE on the President's meeting with Foreign Minister PERSON did not include anything on the reported incidents of violence in GPE against people in the LGBT community. Is the reason why that was not included in the readout is because the President is not informed on the issue? Is the reason why that was not included in the readout is because the President is not informed about the reports of anti-gay violence in GPE? Look, I mean a lot of times there are parts of the conversation that are not specifically included in a readout. But I am not aware -- I have not had that conversation, so I do not know. I was not part of that meeting, so I cannot speak to every detail. And I'd have to refer you to the readout on the specifics of what I know was discussed. Has the President been briefed on this issue generally? Has the President been briefed on this issue generally? That is something I will have to get back to you on. You said you want the GPE investigation to continue at ORG. Would ORG oppose the appointment of a special prosecutor to continue to look into -- to continue the investigation? You have got a ORG committee, a ORG committee, and ORG all working on this. I do not think that there is a necessary need at this point to add that. You have got the Deputy Attorney General, who I would say is about as independent as it comes due to the fact that he has such bipartisan support. What gives you such confidence that the rank and file within the ORG lost faith in the ORG Director? The vast majority of the ORG is in favor of Director PERSON. The real losers here are CARDINAL front-line people in the organization because they lost the only guy working here in DATE who actually cared about them. So what is your response to these rank-and-file ORG agents who disagree with your contention that they lost faith in Director PERSON? Look, we have heard from countless members of the ORG that say very different things. In fact, the President will be meeting with Acting Director PERSON TIME to discuss that very thing -- the morale at the ORG -- as well as make an offer to go directly to the ORG if he feels that that is necessary and appropriate. And we will certainly provide further information on that meeting for you guys. The organization that represents ORG agents is asking for a voice in the selection process of Mr. PERSON's successor. I have not had that conversation, but I know, at this point, it is being run through ORG. And so I would refer you to them on what that process looks like at this point in time. Who did the President consult before making the final decision to fire PERSON? The President spoke with a number of individuals, but at the end of DATE, it was the President's decision. And in between DATE TIME and DATE, when he decided to fire the ORG Director, did he speak again with the Deputy Attorney General or the Attorney General? I know that they spoke on DATE, and I believe the next follow-up was actually in writing. Just to be clear, so is it accurate to pull away from the information that we have that DATE TIME the President made the final call, said I want this in writing as a recommendation, and then took that recommendation as the evidence that he wanted to provide to fire PERSON? My understanding is the decision was actually made on DATE, but the first conversation that he had was on DATE, when there was an oral recommendation made, and the President requested that he see that in writing to review it further. You say you want to move on and focus on the thing that NORP care about. So let me ask you about that. You are somewhat halfway home on healthcare. You still have tax reform to do, a spending bill, debt ceiling, and infrastructure. But what happened DATE, you could argue, just widened the divide and made GPE politics more toxic. So how do you go about accomplishing all of those things with, now, the heightened political environment that we are in? Frankly, I am surprised that it did create a divide since you have had so many NORP and NORP repeatedly calling for Director PERSON to be gone. Frankly, I do not think it matters what this President says, you are going to have NORP come out and fight him every single step of the way. I think that is one of the things that is wrong with GPE, and I think that is one of the reasons that we have got to get back to focusing on those issues and, frankly, draining the swamp a little bit further. Was he surprised by the NORP backlash? Did he anticipate it, considering some of the past statements? How could he have, considering the fact that most of the people that are declaring war DATE were the very ones that were begging for Director PERSON to be fired? If PERSON had won the election -- which, thank God, she did not -- but if she had, and she had been in the same position, she would have fired PERSON immediately, and the very NORP that are criticizing the President DATE would be dancing in the streets celebrating. So it is just the -- I think, the purest form of hypocrisy. CARDINAL, there is a report in GPE that indicates the President has made a decision not to move the GPE embassy from GPE to GPE. Can you confirm that? Has he made a decision on that? The President has not made a decision yet, and is still reviewing that. Also, President PERSON, in his speech, I think, TIME, warned the President against moving the embassy to GPE. Does that warning and warning from other NORP leaders play into his decision as he is considering this move? I am not going to get into the decision-making process here. All I can tell you is that he is still reviewing it, and as soon as we have a decision, I know we will be happy to report back to you guys. CARDINAL questions, both related to the selection of a successor to Director PERSON. When President PERSON chose a ORG director, he had a blue ribbon panel advising him. Presidents PERSON and PERSON interviewed several candidates. Is the President going to follow this pattern, or does he have some individual in mind at this point? Right now, I know that there are several individuals being considered, and the first step will be determining the acting -- or, excuse me, the interim director. And that is being handled through ORG, and I would refer you to them for right now. Oh, yeah, I forgot you have got CARDINAL. I have got CARDINAL. He does not get a question anymore. Who is had a birthday. Just want to make sure we got that in again. I was going to say it is a fact that ORG and Veterans of the Bureau generally prefer people who have been agents themselves or have a background in the ORG. CARDINAL former agents have been director in the DATE. Will the President consider current or former agents for the position? I would say that he is not ruling anything out at this point. But again, as of DATE, ORG is handling the first step in this process. Should the Attorney General, who has recused himself from the GPE investigation, have any role in the selection of a successor? And given the fact that in his DATE interviews, the President himself said he had confidence in Director PERSON, at this podium the NORP people were told he had confidence in Director PERSON, can people take at face value what the President says about personnel issues like this, or his views on things, if DATE, he is out? Absolutely, you can take full confidence in the words of the President. In terms of whether or not Attorney General PERSON should have a role -- look, the ORG is doing a whole lot more than the GPE investigation. I know everybody in this room and probably most of the media around the world would like to think that is the ORG's sole responsibility, but that is probably one of the smallest things that they have got going on their plate, and the CARDINAL employees that work there. And so he should absolutely have a role in seeing who runs that agency and that department. Does the President have confidence in the Acting Director? And secondly, you mentioned earlier that you are encouraging the ORG to move on from the investigation. Is it appropriate for ORG to be directing the ORG what to do with any investigation they are currently investigating? I do not think that that was the nature or the intent of my comment, was not to direct the ORG, but I think it is simply -- we are fully compliant with helping this process move along. We'd like to see it completed so that, frankly, all of us can move on and focus on things that PERSON listed earlier, like tax reform, like healthcare, like infrastructure. Those are big programs, big priorities for this administration. And, frankly, what we'd like to be the CARDINAL thing that we are talking about here, DATE, DATE, is not ORG investigations but things that, frankly, affect NORP voters and NORP taxpayers DATE. What exactly precipitated the DATE meeting? Was that because of the hearing DATE and what he said there? Or did the DATE meeting that the President had with the ORG officials come out of a longer process of consideration of PERSON? The ORG officials were here for other business, not specifically to meet with the President on that. The topic came up, and they asked to speak with the President, and that is how it moved forward. Did the President previously talk to Attorney General PERSON or Deputy Attorney PERSON about the possibility of going this way with PERSON? Not that I am aware of, no. Did it come up in the discussion process before the confirmation that the President was considering nominating PERSON -- did he talk about PERSON with PERSON then? No, not that I am aware of. The President's statement that he talked to PERSON about whether or not he was being investigated raises several questions. Can you talk about why you are not willing to add any more to that about who asked for that and why that was discussed? Who asked for what? About whether or not -- I mean, the President seems to be trying to exonerate himself in this. I mean, can you talk about why you will not add anymore to what that conversation was, how that took place, when it took place -- The CARDINAL occasions -- could you clarify those CARDINAL occasions and who initiated? Again, I am not going to get into the specific details. I will check and see if we have follow-up on that. But at this point, I am not going to comment any further than what was spelled out in the letter. Why was it in the letter? If you do not want to clarify or comment, why was it put in the letter in the first place? Look, I think it was something that is far above my pay grade -- was decided to be included. And again, I am not going to get into the specifics of that.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingprincipaldeputypresssecretarysarahsanders", "title": "Donald J.

{"id": 2, "text": "ENTITY, it looks like the terrorists in GPE have been planning this for DATE. What does that say about the GPE ability to interdict and intercept people with bad intents like this? Well, we had a briefing DATE, and we had some more questions about that. I do not think we have heard the whole story yet. Our responsibility is to protect the NORP people any way that we can. We also have to protect our civil liberties in our country, and we have to keep that balance. But according to what we heard, it would have been very hard to - we will see.

And we know we have a responsibility to keep government open, and that is what we are striving to do, in spite of some of the bad riders that are still in the bill from DATE gone by that have, shall we say, ossified within the process.

So, back to my question, the Speaker has said that they are considering - they are working on the tax extenders bill and the omnibus side by side. Is there a possibility, if you get trade-offs - if they do in fact cleave these bills apart and they are separate pieces - if you get something in tax extenders, in Child Credit or you get guns here - that that is considered this macro sense because That if the negotiation is being worked out that way - that you are looking at these CARDINAL pieces of legislation side by side and it is not horse-trading on just CARDINAL bill, horse-trading on the other because then they - because they want to get as many NORP as possible That if you get something in tax extenders, they get something in the omnibus, and vice versa? I thought you were going to say if they joined them together - so let me anticipate that. I would not vote for it. I would not recommend that anybody else vote for it. So that is not a way to keep government open, unless they have all of the NORP votes to do it. But they obviously want to get as many NORP as they can for the omnibus. Ok, but you have already had your question. ENTITY, I am wondering if it is starting to look unlikely that you can get a big deal on extenders and perhaps you will end up with just a DATE extension? No, they could have a NORP extender bill. I am only speaking for the ORG NORP. And when they say, 'Oh, I am holding up the extender bill,' I have never been for it, I was not for it before it had Big Oil in it. I think the extender bill that is out there - as I said - is destructive of our future. It is the wrong way to go, to have MONEY, maybe MONEY of dollars in permanent tax extenders. There is no reason we have to go down that path. I negotiated those - as I said before - with President PERSON. It was historic - the levels to which we took that. But, it is time to have indexation for that. They do not want to hear about that. So, from my stand point - and some of my Members even think, with extenders - indexation in it, they would not be for the bill because it is too big. It undermines our ability to get something done for the future. So, as I said to Senator PERSON - you are either saying, 'I am holding it up or I am not in the loop. I cannot be both, but, I do not even want to be in the loop on that bill.' And then, to add the ban - lifting the ban on the oil and all the money that means for the oil industry - while they cannot index for children - it is just too big, it is unfair, and it does not have support of ORG NORP. But, it could have the support of others. I am not speaking for anyone except ORG NORP. ENTITY, some of the budget-watch groups have said that if this extender package goes through, this NORP-controlled ORG will add MONEY to the debt. I am just saying they have a different view of what adds to the deficit. What I do know is a stimulus to the economy is to invest in Child Tax Credit, earned income tax credit because people spend that money immediately. It injects money into the economy. But then, if you review the list of some of the things that they have - and some of them are not - I mean, CARDINAL, small businesses - we created that. It is not the issue of - now, some of them are terrible, and they are permanent and unpaid for. So, they have no justification. Others of them - okay, if we are going to have to. We have to pay for 9/11. We have to find the money to pay for 9/11, for the health and the compensation of people who - in an emergency, so that should make it not have to be paid for - in an emergency, risked their lives, have consequences, health and otherwise - that we owe them this compensation. We have to find the money to pay for that, but MONEY permanent, unpaid-for tax breaks - I mean, I am glad to hear you say that there are some people who are concerned about the budget because I have not heard many of them speak up. But, they have the majority, and this is their vehicle. And so, there are some negotiation going on with them on it, and I am not part of that because I do not believe in it. My Members share that view. By the way, my Members are the most vocal on this because I listen to what they have to say. I notify them of what I hear. I do not tell them what we are going to do. I hear what they say back, and they do not even want us negotiating on it for anything because they think it is the wrong place to go. And I think if the NORP people understood that all this talk about the budget and the rest - and this is a President who deserves so much praise. When he took office, the deficit was PERCENT higher than it is now. CARDINAL - it is CARDINAL, CARDINAL. So, he is worked very hard to take down the deficit. Now, the NORP come in with this and say, 'We have the majority. If you want some of these extensions to happen, you have to go big.' So, the baseline is different for how we want to invest in the future. Take it off the table, so that these are all taken care of in any discussion we have about simplification or fairness in the tax code that really creates growth, creates more good paying jobs in our country and has many more people participating in the prosperity of our country.' And this is their current manifestation of trickle down, but they have the majority, and so they need to be negotiated with, of course. And the president has his signature, so that gives him leverage in that discussion, but I made it clear - do not count on our votes for that. ENTITY, could you verify if the Child Tax Credit is added to this bill that you say is too big and destructive, could you still support it? They are not going to index it. Instead, they put 'Big Oil' in there. So in others, when you see the bill and you say, 'Well, how can we give better balance to this bill by indexation?' They come in and say, 'No, not indexation - let us go on the other side and do big oil.' But you know what, if they have the votes, this is what they want to do, we do not want to give our imprimatur to it. Does ORG agree with you guys? You will have to talk to them. In other words, we have shared values on this and at some place, this bill will be improved by the negotiation that ORG will have because they want to sign something. We do not need to be for it. They will have enough NORP votes supporting their special interest friends to pass this thing in TIME. And that is why I do not want it joined to the omnibus bill - because they do not want to support the omnibus bill, I do not know what happens to the whole package because of that. I think we are on a path - our responsibility is to keep government open for the NORP people. They have frivolously indicated that they'd be willing to shut it down, so we have to work hard with the new Speaker, extending the hand of friendship - any suggestions or opportunities we may have to work together - we have that responsibility to find our common ground and that is what we are doing. Somebody had this idea about this big other package.

Instead, they put 'Big Oil' in there. So in others, when you see the bill and you say, 'Well, how can we give better balance to this bill by indexation?' They come in and say, 'No, not indexation - let us go on the other side and do big oil.' But you know what, if they have the votes, this is what they want to do, we do not want to give our imprimatur to it. Does ORG agree with you guys? You will have to talk to them. In other words, we have shared values on this and at some place, this bill will be improved by the negotiation that ORG will have because they want to sign something. We do not need to be for it. They will have enough NORP votes supporting their special interest friends to pass this thing in TIME. And that is why I do not want it joined to the omnibus bill - because they do not want to support the omnibus bill, I do not know what happens to the whole package because of that. I think we are on a path - our responsibility is to keep government open for the NORP people. They have frivolously indicated that they'd be willing to shut it down, so we have to work hard with the new Speaker, extending the hand of friendship - any suggestions or opportunities we may have to work together - we have that responsibility to find our common ground and that is what we are doing.

{"id": 2, "text": "ENTITY, it looks like the terrorists in GPE have been planning this for DATE. What does that say about the GPE ability to interdict and intercept people with bad intents like this? Well, we had a briefing DATE, and we had some more questions about that. I do not think we have heard the whole story yet. Our responsibility is to protect the NORP people any way that we can. We also have to protect our civil liberties in our country, and we have to keep that balance. But according to what we heard, it would have been very hard to - we will see. We have to learn more, but from what we heard DATE - was that DATE when we had the briefing? ENTITY, have NORP responded to your call to get rid of the Dickey Amendment in the omnibus? And if that is not removed from the omnibus, will NORP be able to reach a deal? Well, I think of it more as an incentive for NORP to vote for the bill. And we know we have a responsibility to keep government open, and that is what we are striving to do, in spite of some of the bad riders that are still in the bill from DATE gone by that have, shall we say, ossified within the process. But I think it is a gift to them to say, 'You want our votes? Here is a way to get them.' I think of it more in the positive. Are you going to ask about the ORG? I thought you were going to ask me - you know, the ORG and the ORG play in DATE. When the ORG are winning all of these games straight, he does not want to talk about it. We do not have a basketball team in GPE. But we have one - ORG. And we are very proud of PERSON. But they play in GPE. So, back to my question, the Speaker has said that they are considering - they are working on the tax extenders bill and the omnibus side by side. Is there a possibility, if you get trade-offs - if they do in fact cleave these bills apart and they are separate pieces - if you get something in tax extenders, in Child Credit or you get guns here - that that is considered this macro sense because That if the negotiation is being worked out that way - that you are looking at these CARDINAL pieces of legislation side by side and it is not horse-trading on just CARDINAL bill, horse-trading on the other because then they - because they want to get as many NORP as possible That if you get something in tax extenders, they get something in the omnibus, and vice versa? I thought you were going to say if they joined them together - so let me anticipate that. I would not vote for it. I would not recommend that anybody else vote for it. So that is not a way to keep government open, unless they have all of the NORP votes to do it. But they obviously want to get as many NORP as they can for the omnibus. Ok, but you have already had your question. ENTITY, I am wondering if it is starting to look unlikely that you can get a big deal on extenders and perhaps you will end up with just a DATE extension? No, they could have a NORP extender bill. I am only speaking for the ORG NORP. And when they say, 'Oh, I am holding up the extender bill,' I have never been for it, I was not for it before it had Big Oil in it. I think the extender bill that is out there - as I said - is destructive of our future. It is the wrong way to go, to have MONEY, maybe MONEY of dollars in permanent tax extenders. There is no reason we have to go down that path. I negotiated those - as I said before - with President PERSON. It was historic - the levels to which we took that. But, it is time to have indexation for that. They do not want to hear about that. So, from my stand point - and some of my Members even think, with extenders - indexation in it, they would not be for the bill because it is too big. It undermines our ability to get something done for the future. So, as I said to Senator PERSON - you are either saying, 'I am holding it up or I am not in the loop. I cannot be both, but, I do not even want to be in the loop on that bill.' And then, to add the ban - lifting the ban on the oil and all the money that means for the oil industry - while they cannot index for children - it is just too big, it is unfair, and it does not have support of ORG NORP. But, it could have the support of others. I am not speaking for anyone except ORG NORP. ENTITY, some of the budget-watch groups have said that if this extender package goes through, this NORP-controlled ORG will add MONEY to the debt. I am just saying they have a different view of what adds to the deficit. What I do know is a stimulus to the economy is to invest in Child Tax Credit, earned income tax credit because people spend that money immediately. It injects money into the economy. But then, if you review the list of some of the things that they have - and some of them are not - I mean, CARDINAL, small businesses - we created that. It is not the issue of - now, some of them are terrible, and they are permanent and unpaid for. So, they have no justification. Others of them - okay, if we are going to have to. We have to pay for 9/11. We have to find the money to pay for 9/11, for the health and the compensation of people who - in an emergency, so that should make it not have to be paid for - in an emergency, risked their lives, have consequences, health and otherwise - that we owe them this compensation. We have to find the money to pay for that, but MONEY permanent, unpaid-for tax breaks - I mean, I am glad to hear you say that there are some people who are concerned about the budget because I have not heard many of them speak up. But, they have the majority, and this is their vehicle. And so, there are some negotiation going on with them on it, and I am not part of that because I do not believe in it. My Members share that view. By the way, my Members are the most vocal on this because I listen to what they have to say. I notify them of what I hear. I do not tell them what we are going to do. I hear what they say back, and they do not even want us negotiating on it for anything because they think it is the wrong place to go. And I think if the NORP people understood that all this talk about the budget and the rest - and this is a President who deserves so much praise. When he took office, the deficit was PERCENT higher than it is now. CARDINAL - it is CARDINAL, CARDINAL. So, he is worked very hard to take down the deficit. Now, the NORP come in with this and say, 'We have the majority. If you want some of these extensions to happen, you have to go big.' So, the baseline is different for how we want to invest in the future. Take it off the table, so that these are all taken care of in any discussion we have about simplification or fairness in the tax code that really creates growth, creates more good paying jobs in our country and has many more people participating in the prosperity of our country.' And this is their current manifestation of trickle down, but they have the majority, and so they need to be negotiated with, of course. And the president has his signature, so that gives him leverage in that discussion, but I made it clear - do not count on our votes for that. ENTITY, could you verify if the Child Tax Credit is added to this bill that you say is too big and destructive, could you still support it? They are not going to index it.

{"id": 3, "text": "PERSON has adopted the same view of war powers as ORG. Do you share that view? No, I do believe that when we passed the authorization in DATE following GPE, it was to narrow the war powers then. When our country is - when someone strikes our country as was on 9/11, it enables, it triggers any and all powers of the Commander-In-Chief. What we did with that resolution was to narrow it to the purposes. I have it right here, but if you read it, you will see that it is a narrower interpretation. What the PERSON Administration, how they interpreted it and for how long is another issue. ORG is a threat. We have to work together to destroy them, and that is the subject at hand. I did not approve of anything said or did when he was in office, much less care about his opinion right now. But you do not think that President PERSON is following his opinion right now?  I think the President is following the law. Given the threat the President outlined that ORG posed and you mentioning it, does not ORG have a bigger role beyond just voting on the narrow authorization for Title X? Is not it shirking its responsibility by just focussing on that issue alone? Well, Title X is really an important part of this and among the initiatives that the President talked about TIME, the idea of our training NORP moderates to fight ORG in GPE is an important part of it and it is very timely. That is why we are talking about that now. I would hope that it would be in the ORG because that is the train leaving the station, and that is- the President needs this to happen now. There is talk of people doing it separately, but that takes longer than just putting it on, again, the FAC that is leaving the station. But that is by no means to say that that is the limitation on our involvement in this. But in terms of this authorization, this is a big debate. We are having a brief right now. As I leave here, I will go to another briefing on the subject. And again, yes, I do believe ORG has a role. What I did say, though, was what the President is doing now, I think he has the legal authority to do. I have studied this issue for a very long time. You have been in the ORG here for a very, very long time. How far do your concerns go as we take new steps to confront ORG about the aftermath - the potential aftermath of the NORP arming their NORP assets in GPE? The NORP arming the NORP militias anew? Us arming the factions in GPE, all that come at ORG sort of in a triangle here? And eventually, there will be a lot more armed people in GPE, not only weapons but battle hardened people with - have their incentives changed at all? What is your vision of the aftermath after we do this? Well, I started my comments in praise of the President about the establishment of a different government in GPE, which I think, if that had not happened - so then the situation that you are describing, I believe, would be exacerbated - although your concerns go beyond GPE, I understand. It goes into GPE. So, to have a government that understands its responsibilities - that it is not just about who the NORP in charge, the NORP rule and we do not pay any attention to the needs of NORP or the NORP - that provides fertile territory for some, especially the NORP, to be responsive to ORG when they were originally coming through. When you are arming people, you are always concerned. And also, ORG, I am concerned, is a mutating thing, you know, what is it that it becomes and what emerges out of all of this. The NORP are very interested because they have CARDINAL. We may have CARDINAL foreign fighters from the GPE who have gone there. The NORP have CARDINAL, CARDINAL maybe, who have passports from their countries, who are citizens of their countries who have joined the fighting force. So the concern goes beyond our concern about our homeland; that is our primary responsibility. But this is a very big deal and we have to deal with it in a way that is not just- and PERSON talked about it- the use of violence. Yet people think CARDINAL more act of violence is going to end it, but it is just an endless flywheel. No, we have to be smart about it as to how we go forward so that we are having not just military initiatives but political initiatives and diplomatic initiatives, too, so that we reduce the fertile territory for more recruitment of terrorists. Then what level of confidence has been transmitted to you, ENTITY, from the ORG that NORP coalition CARDINAL or whatever we are on now is actually going to work this time? Well, we have to support it. And CARDINAL other part that I did not mention was continuing the humanitarian assistance in some of those regions. As you see what the GPE did to help those people on the mountain was lifesaving, but it was also helpful in having people understand that we are there to help the people. We are not there to help the government. But to have a government that is there for all of the people is essential for us to be putting in resources because your question is exactly the right one. This, the government has to work or otherwise the investments that we are making otherwise - diplomatically, politically, intelligence wise, militarily - fall into a chaotic situation; so we cannot have that. That is why I think the President's deliberativeness in how he has dealt with this step by step to put us in a place now where we can go to the next step, because the first, initial - not everything has been done as far as the government is concerned, but a great deal has been done. how do you feel about setting the end date for the reauthorization date to ORG separate from the DATE end date for the CR? How do you feel about those and how do those affect the NORP support for a CR here? Well, CRs are never something to be very, very proud of because it means that we have not been able to get all of our work done in a timely fashion. Sometimes they are a convenience and sometimes they are an excuse not to - well, let us just do a CR, and I say that as one who has had to use CRs myself. But the CR end date for DATE is very appropriate. to get us past the DATE beginning of DATE. So the end date in DATE is an appropriate one so that we will pass something, an omnibus, a better deal, a more responsible way to advance our appropriations for DATE. I do not think we should delay it any longer. If they do not think that they can be made within DATE, then they should be made within DATE. In terms of the expiration date for ORG, I am totally opposed to that. I think that ORG is a formidable instrument for competitiveness for the GPE businesses, large and small. I think that it affects every region of the country in terms of job creation and stability. I think that it has already having an impact on contracts because of there is uncertainty about the longevity of the bank and even its existence and that if you put the date to DATE, you are effectively putting a marker as to the demise of ORG. I like the PERSON bill that has a long term authorization for ORG, and I would hope that those forces outside the ORG - communities that are affected, businesses that are affected and the rest - that this is about job creation; this is about keeping GPE number one; it is about facilitating our exports. To play with this is really damaging, because you are dealing with a bank and you are talking about DATE and DATE and DATE, you are not talking about the stability and the certainty that businesses need. And some of these are very big contracts. this is not something to mess with, because I do not believe that it is good. ENTITY, there never really has been much hope for peace dividend following the, you know, 9/11 mindset and foreign policy, et cetera, as we wound down the wars in GPE and GPE. Do some of your ORG members, though, worry that as this fight against ORG gets expanded, we will siphon off a lot of dollars for social programs? That they may favor? Well, there is some necessities that honor our responsibilities to meet the needs of the NORP people. I do not think we are getting - I do not think with the evidence that I see before me, I judge, that what we are talking about is by no means of the scale of where we had been before. This is focused, targeted, discreet, and it is not engaging in CARDINAL of troops being deployed. In fact, it is exactly the opposite of that. But certainly, every time we talk about an initiative or the use of force or initiation of hostilities, it is a question of resources, and we have so many unmet needs in our own country. It is really, what is more of concern to Members when we were building roads and schools and hospitals and all the rest in GPE and GPE, when we had unmet needs in our own country, but actually that part of the diplomacy is important to security as well. yes, there is a concern, and it has been brought up at our meetings, but we have a first responsibility to protect and defend. I think I only have time for CARDINAL more question. ENTITY, has there been a concern raised in ORG in voting for this authorization and ending up in a situation potentially in the future where you have sort of a political pushback much like you did with the authorization for GPE? Well, we did not vote for the authorization for GPE, so we did not get to take - well, and ORG NORP overwhelmingly voted against the GPE initiative in DATE. DATE initiation was in DATE, of hostilities. The President made his speech TIME which was very strong and convincing. Our Members are proud and support the President. How do we engage other countries? What is the country that we are dealing with in terms of having a new government? And what is, you know, what is our definition of success? But it is not about, you know, whether we take a vote or not. We are not at that point because we believe the President has the authority. And so it is deliberative; it is open to new information - that is what our ORG is about - and I am very proud of the thoughtful way that they have approached it. I will go back to where I began on this subject, and that is, that a matter of DATE we did vote and we got an amendment on the floor. The President shall not deploy or maintain GPE armed forces in a sustained combat role in GPE without specific statutory authorization for such use, and that is after the date of the enactment of this concurrent resolution. So, hopefully we do not have to go beyond what the President is doing now and we will not need that vote, but we stand ready to have that discussion. I have to go back to work.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "pelosihousegovnewspressreleasestranscriptofpelosiweeklypressconferencetoday6", "title": "Transcript of Pelosi Weekly Press Conference Today", "source": "https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/transcript-of-pelosi-weekly-press-conference-today-6", "publication_date": "11-09-2014", "crawling_date": "28-06-2023", "politician": ["Nancy Pelosi"], "gender": ["F"]}}

Is not it shirking its responsibility by just focussing on that issue alone? Well, Title X is really an important part of this and among the initiatives that the President talked about TIME, the idea of our training NORP moderates to fight ORG in GPE is an important part of it and it is very timely. That is why we are talking about that now. I would hope that it would be in the ORG because that is the train leaving the station, and that is- the President needs this to happen now. There is talk of people doing it separately, but that takes longer than just putting it on, again, the FAC that is leaving the station. But that is by no means to say that that is the limitation on our involvement in this. But in terms of this authorization, this is a big debate. We are having a brief right now. As I leave here, I will go to another briefing on the subject. And again, yes, I do believe ORG has a role. What I did say, though, was what the President is doing now, I think he has the legal authority to do. I have studied this issue for a very long time. You have been in the ORG here for a very, very long time. How far do your concerns go as we take new steps to confront ORG about the aftermath - the potential aftermath of the NORP arming their NORP assets in GPE? The NORP arming the NORP militias anew? Us arming the factions in GPE, all that come at ORG sort of in a triangle here? And eventually, there will be a lot more armed people in GPE, not only weapons but battle hardened people with - have their incentives changed at all? What is your vision of the aftermath after we do this? Well, I started my comments in praise of the President about the establishment of a different government in GPE, which I think, if that had not happened - so then the situation that you are describing, I believe, would be exacerbated - although your concerns go beyond GPE, I understand. It goes into GPE. So, to have a government that understands its responsibilities - that it is not just about who the NORP in charge, the NORP rule and we do not pay any attention to the needs of NORP or the NORP - that provides fertile territory for some, especially the NORP, to be responsive to ORG when they were originally coming through. When you are arming people, you are always concerned. And also, ORG, I am concerned, is a mutating thing, you know, what is it that it becomes and what emerges out of all of this. The NORP are very interested because they have CARDINAL. We may have CARDINAL foreign fighters from the GPE who have gone there. The NORP have CARDINAL, CARDINAL maybe, who have passports from their countries, who are citizens of their countries who have joined the fighting force. So the concern goes beyond our concern about our homeland; that is our primary responsibility. But this is a very big deal and we have to deal with it in a way that is not just- and PERSON talked about it- the use of violence. Yet people think CARDINAL more act of violence is going to end it, but it is just an endless flywheel. No, we have to be smart about it as to how we go forward so that we are having not just military initiatives but political initiatives and diplomatic initiatives, too, so that we reduce the fertile territory for more recruitment of terrorists. Then what level of confidence has been transmitted to you, ENTITY, from the ORG that NORP coalition CARDINAL or whatever we are on now is actually going to work this time? Well, we have to support it. And CARDINAL other part that I did not mention was continuing the humanitarian assistance in some of those regions. As you see what the GPE did to help those people on the mountain was lifesaving, but it was also helpful in having people understand that we are there to help the people. We are not there to help the government. But to have a government that is there for all of the people is essential for us to be putting in resources because your question is exactly the right one. This, the government has to work or otherwise the investments that we are making otherwise - diplomatically, politically, intelligence wise, militarily - fall into a chaotic situation; so we cannot have that. That is why I think the President's deliberativeness in how he has dealt with this step by step to put us in a place now where we can go to the next step, because the first, initial - not everything has been done as far as the government is concerned, but a great deal has been done. how do you feel about setting the end date for the reauthorization date to ORG separate from the DATE end date for the CR? How do you feel about those and how do those affect the NORP support for a CR here? Well, CRs are never something to be very, very proud of because it means that we have not been able to get all of our work done in a timely fashion. Sometimes they are a convenience and sometimes they are an excuse not to - well, let us just do a CR, and I say that as one who has had to use CRs myself. But the CR end date for DATE is very appropriate. to get us past the DATE beginning of DATE. So the end date in DATE is an appropriate one so that we will pass something, an omnibus, a better deal, a more responsible way to advance our appropriations for DATE. I do not think we should delay it any longer. If they do not think that they can be made within DATE, then they should be made within DATE. In terms of the expiration date for ORG, I am totally opposed to that. I think that ORG is a formidable instrument for competitiveness for the GPE businesses, large and small. I think that it affects every region of the country in terms of job creation and stability. I think that it has already having an impact on contracts because of there is uncertainty about the longevity of the bank and even its existence and that if you put the date to DATE, you are effectively putting a marker as to the demise of ORG. I like the PERSON bill that has a long term authorization for ORG, and I would hope that those forces outside the ORG - communities that are affected, businesses that are affected and the rest - that this is about job creation; this is about keeping GPE number one; it is about facilitating our exports. To play with this is really damaging, because you are dealing with a bank and you are talking about DATE and DATE and DATE, you are not talking about the stability and the certainty that businesses need. And some of these are very big contracts. this is not something to mess with, because I do not believe that it is good. ENTITY, there never really has been much hope for peace dividend following the, you know, 9/11 mindset and foreign policy, et cetera, as we wound down the wars in GPE and GPE. Do some of your ORG members, though, worry that as this fight against ORG gets expanded, we will siphon off a lot of dollars for social programs? That they may favor? Well, there is some necessities that honor our responsibilities to meet the needs of the NORP people. I do not think we are getting - I do not think with the evidence that I see before me, I judge, that what we are talking about is by no means of the scale of where we had been before. This is focused, targeted, discreet, and it is not engaging in CARDINAL of troops being deployed. In fact, it is exactly the opposite of that. But certainly, every time we talk about an initiative or the use of force or initiation of hostilities, it is a question of resources, and we have so many unmet needs in our own country. It is really, what is more of concern to Members when we were building roads and schools and hospitals and all the rest in GPE and GPE, when we had unmet needs in our own country, but actually that part of the diplomacy is important to security as well. yes, there is a concern, and it has been brought up at our meetings, but we have a first responsibility to protect and defend. I think I only have time for CARDINAL more question. ENTITY, has there been a concern raised in ORG in voting for this authorization and ending up in a situation potentially in the future where you have sort of a political pushback much like you did with the authorization for GPE? Well, we did not vote for the authorization for GPE, so we did not get to take - well, and ORG NORP overwhelmingly voted against the GPE initiative in DATE. DATE initiation was in DATE, of hostilities. The President made his speech TIME which was very strong and convincing. Our Members are proud and support the President. How do we engage other countries? What is the country that we are dealing with in terms of having a new government? And what is, you know, what is our definition of success? But it is not about, you know, whether we take a vote or not. We are not at that point because we believe the President has the authority. And so it is deliberative; it is open to new information - that is what our ORG is about - and I am very proud of the thoughtful way that they have approached it. I will go back to where I began on this subject, and that is, that a matter of DATE we did vote and we got an amendment on the floor. The President shall not deploy or maintain GPE armed forces in a sustained combat role in GPE without specific statutory authorization for such use, and that is after the date of the enactment of this concurrent resolution. So, hopefully we do not have to go beyond what the President is doing now and we will not need that vote, but we stand ready to have that discussion. I have to go back to work.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "pelosihousegovnewspressreleasestranscriptofpelosiweeklypressconferencetoday6", "title": "Transcript of Pelosi Weekly Press Conference Today", "source": "https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/transcript-of-pelosi-weekly-press-conference-today-6", "publication_date": "11-09-2014", "crawling_date": "28-06-2023", "politician": ["Nancy Pelosi"], "gender": ["F"]}}

It goes into GPE. So, to have a government that understands its responsibilities - that it is not just about who the NORP in charge, the NORP rule and we do not pay any attention to the needs of NORP or the NORP - that provides fertile territory for some, especially the NORP, to be responsive to ORG when they were originally coming through. When you are arming people, you are always concerned. And also, ORG, I am concerned, is a mutating thing, you know, what is it that it becomes and what emerges out of all of this. The NORP are very interested because they have CARDINAL. We may have CARDINAL foreign fighters from the GPE who have gone there. The NORP have CARDINAL, CARDINAL maybe, who have passports from their countries, who are citizens of their countries who have joined the fighting force. So the concern goes beyond our concern about our homeland; that is our primary responsibility. But this is a very big deal and we have to deal with it in a way that is not just- and PERSON talked about it- the use of violence. Yet people think CARDINAL more act of violence is going to end it, but it is just an endless flywheel. No, we have to be smart about it as to how we go forward so that we are having not just military initiatives but political initiatives and diplomatic initiatives, too, so that we reduce the fertile territory for more recruitment of terrorists. Then what level of confidence has been transmitted to you, ENTITY, from the ORG that NORP coalition CARDINAL or whatever we are on now is actually going to work this time? Well, we have to support it. And CARDINAL other part that I did not mention was continuing the humanitarian assistance in some of those regions. As you see what the GPE did to help those people on the mountain was lifesaving, but it was also helpful in having people understand that we are there to help the people. We are not there to help the government. But to have a government that is there for all of the people is essential for us to be putting in resources because your question is exactly the right one. This, the government has to work or otherwise the investments that we are making otherwise - diplomatically, politically, intelligence wise, militarily - fall into a chaotic situation; so we cannot have that. That is why I think the President's deliberativeness in how he has dealt with this step by step to put us in a place now where we can go to the next step, because the first, initial - not everything has been done as far as the government is concerned, but a great deal has been done. how do you feel about setting the end date for the reauthorization date to ORG separate from the DATE end date for the CR? How do you feel about those and how do those affect the NORP support for a CR here? Well, CRs are never something to be very, very proud of because it means that we have not been able to get all of our work done in a timely fashion. Sometimes they are a convenience and sometimes they are an excuse not to - well, let us just do a CR, and I say that as one who has had to use CRs myself. But the CR end date for DATE is very appropriate. to get us past the DATE beginning of DATE. So the end date in DATE is an appropriate one so that we will pass something, an omnibus, a better deal, a more responsible way to advance our appropriations for DATE. I do not think we should delay it any longer. If they do not think that they can be made within DATE, then they should be made within DATE. In terms of the expiration date for ORG, I am totally opposed to that. I think that ORG is a formidable instrument for competitiveness for the GPE businesses, large and small. I think that it affects every region of the country in terms of job creation and stability. I think that it has already having an impact on contracts because of there is uncertainty about the longevity of the bank and even its existence and that if you put the date to DATE, you are effectively putting a marker as to the demise of ORG. I like the PERSON bill that has a long term authorization for ORG, and I would hope that those forces outside the ORG - communities that are affected, businesses that are affected and the rest - that this is about job creation; this is about keeping GPE number one; it is about facilitating our exports. To play with this is really damaging, because you are dealing with a bank and you are talking about DATE and DATE and DATE, you are not talking about the stability and the certainty that businesses need. And some of these are very big contracts. this is not something to mess with, because I do not believe that it is good. ENTITY, there never really has been much hope for peace dividend following the, you know, 9/11 mindset and foreign policy, et cetera, as we wound down the wars in GPE and GPE. Do some of your ORG members, though, worry that as this fight against ORG gets expanded, we will siphon off a lot of dollars for social programs? That they may favor? Well, there is some necessities that honor our responsibilities to meet the needs of the NORP people. I do not think we are getting - I do not think with the evidence that I see before me, I judge, that what we are talking about is by no means of the scale of where we had been before. This is focused, targeted, discreet, and it is not engaging in CARDINAL of troops being deployed. In fact, it is exactly the opposite of that. But certainly, every time we talk about an initiative or the use of force or initiation of hostilities, it is a question of resources, and we have so many unmet needs in our own country. It is really, what is more of concern to Members when we were building roads and schools and hospitals and all the rest in GPE and GPE, when we had unmet needs in our own country, but actually that part of the diplomacy is important to security as well. yes, there is a concern, and it has been brought up at our meetings, but we have a first responsibility to protect and defend. I think I only have time for CARDINAL more question. ENTITY, has there been a concern raised in ORG in voting for this authorization and ending up in a situation potentially in the future where you have sort of a political pushback much like you did with the authorization for GPE? Well, we did not vote for the authorization for GPE, so we did not get to take - well, and ORG NORP overwhelmingly voted against the GPE initiative in DATE. DATE initiation was in DATE, of hostilities. The President made his speech TIME which was very strong and convincing. Our Members are proud and support the President. How do we engage other countries? What is the country that we are dealing with in terms of having a new government? And what is, you know, what is our definition of success? But it is not about, you know, whether we take a vote or not. We are not at that point because we believe the President has the authority. And so it is deliberative; it is open to new information - that is what our ORG is about - and I am very proud of the thoughtful way that they have approached it. I will go back to where I began on this subject, and that is, that a matter of DATE we did vote and we got an amendment on the floor. The President shall not deploy or maintain GPE armed forces in a sustained combat role in GPE without specific statutory authorization for such use, and that is after the date of the enactment of this concurrent resolution. So, hopefully we do not have to go beyond what the President is doing now and we will not need that vote, but we stand ready to have that discussion. I have to go back to work.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "pelosihousegovnewspressreleasestranscriptofpelosiweeklypressconferencetoday6", "title": "Transcript of Pelosi Weekly Press Conference Today", "source": "https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/transcript-of-pelosi-weekly-press-conference-today-6", "publication_date": "11-09-2014", "crawling_date": "28-06-2023", "politician": ["Nancy Pelosi"], "gender": ["F"]}}
{"id": 3, "text": "PERSON has adopted the same view of war powers as ORG. Do you share that view? No, I do believe that when we passed the authorization in DATE following GPE, it was to narrow the war powers then. When our country is - when someone strikes our country as was on 9/11, it enables, it triggers any and all powers of the Commander-In-Chief. What we did with that resolution was to narrow it to the purposes. I have it right here, but if you read it, you will see that it is a narrower interpretation. What the PERSON Administration, how they interpreted it and for how long is another issue. ORG is a threat. We have to work together to destroy them, and that is the subject at hand. I did not approve of anything said or did when he was in office, much less care about his opinion right now. But you do not think that President PERSON is following his opinion right now?  I think the President is following the law. Given the threat the President outlined that ORG posed and you mentioning it, does not ORG have a bigger role beyond just voting on the narrow authorization for Title X? Is not it shirking its responsibility by just focussing on that issue alone? Well, Title X is really an important part of this and among the initiatives that the President talked about TIME, the idea of our training NORP moderates to fight ORG in GPE is an important part of it and it is very timely. That is why we are talking about that now. I would hope that it would be in the ORG because that is the train leaving the station, and that is- the President needs this to happen now. There is talk of people doing it separately, but that takes longer than just putting it on, again, the FAC that is leaving the station. But that is by no means to say that that is the limitation on our involvement in this. But in terms of this authorization, this is a big debate. We are having a brief right now. As I leave here, I will go to another briefing on the subject. And again, yes, I do believe ORG has a role. What I did say, though, was what the President is doing now, I think he has the legal authority to do. I have studied this issue for a very long time. You have been in the ORG here for a very, very long time. How far do your concerns go as we take new steps to confront ORG about the aftermath - the potential aftermath of the NORP arming their NORP assets in GPE? The NORP arming the NORP militias anew? Us arming the factions in GPE, all that come at ORG sort of in a triangle here? And eventually, there will be a lot more armed people in GPE, not only weapons but battle hardened people with - have their incentives changed at all? What is your vision of the aftermath after we do this? Well, I started my comments in praise of the President about the establishment of a different government in GPE, which I think, if that had not happened - so then the situation that you are describing, I believe, would be exacerbated - although your concerns go beyond GPE, I understand.

{"id": 4, "text": "Infrastructure and the NORP' budget resolution from someone who was with the President DATE. I am joined now by GPE NORP ENTITY. I am wondering just from what you saw DATE, what you heard from the President, were you happy or satisfied with what you heard from President PERSON DATE in terms of his commitment to battling climate change and providing help to GPE? Well, I think in the immediate sense, we have been able to help facilitate in working with President PERSON as well as ORG in getting CARDINAL of the fastest ever disaster assistance approvals from ORG so that we could help people on the ground and start helping people recover as quickly as possible. Now, when it comes to climate change, we have to do so much more, and the President's agenda, yes, is important. We must pass the Build Back Better Act, but it is not done until it is on the President's desk, and we also need to make sure that we are continuing to fund these priorities. Right now, reconciliation is really embattled and we have to make sure that we actually bring this legislation home with the Build Back Better Act and making sure that climate is protected, because the fossil fuel industry and the interests of the fossil fuel industry are very much doing their best to try to shape both this legislation and making sure that they are trying to pit it, and frankly, tank it compared to the Infrastructure Act as well. When one talks to experts on climate change and what, in order to respond effectively, what would need to be done, when you actually start to look at the full scope of all the aspects of life that would be impacted and need to be impacted, I mean, the production of how concrete is made, how steel is made, farming procedures, the electrical grid, it is a huge societal shift. Do you think NORP are ready for that or been kind of prepared for that? I think we absolutely are because the question is not if our entire world and our entire society is going to shift because of climate change, it is a matter of how it is going to shift. So basically, if we do nothing to address climate change, we are going to see the continued destruction of our supply chains. We are going to see our crops not be able to grow in the same way. We will see the continuation and proliferation of other future pandemics as well. And so that is how our life could change if we do nothing. It will change dramatically, but it could also change dramatically in a positive direction if we do something. We can create CARDINAL of union jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure, shoring up our cities, our rural areas and our suburbs in order to prepare for the climate catastrophes that could come to our shores, but also draw down our carbon output in order to make sure that we prevent future calamities from happening as well. You are obviously from a more progressive wing in ORG than President PERSON, who got elected in part by pledging to work across party lines. And as you clearly know, the bipartisan infrastructure bill seems stall because NORP moderates in the ORG are balking at the price tag of a separated but related budget resolution that is key to the ORG even taking up the infrastructure bill. Is this split among NORP, what do you make of it? I mean, is it healthy in your view? Well, I certainly do not think it is healthy that ORG lobbyists are bragging about how many senators, NORP and NORP, that they get to have on speed dial and enjoy exclusive access to shaping the contours of this quote, unquote bipartisan infrastructure bill. I think the role of dark money and the fossil fuel lobby is extremely unhealthy for our democracy. But the fact of the matter is, is that we have got the people on our side, and this is what we continue to say. They have money, these lobbyists and special interests have money, but we have got people. The Build Back Better Act has popular support, and even going above and beyond that, the Green New Deal has popular support even among NORP and NORP. And so what people I think are united behind is the acknowledgement that climate change is human caused, that the burning of fossil fuels and the continued construction of fossil fuel infrastructure like what we are seeing with FAC in GPE must be confronted if we are going to create a better future for ourselves. And we can do it while creating CARDINAL of union jobs. President PERSON was just asked TIME about CARDINAL of the key moderate, or often referred to as moderate NORP opposing the MONEY reconciliation package, Senator PERSON. I just want to play for our viewers what he had to say. Do you trust President PERSON to strike a deal with Senator PERSON or do you worry about President PERSON striking a deal with Senator PERSON? I mean, is there a deal that all NORP will accept, including PERSON? Well, I think one of the interesting aspects of this situation is that it is not just Senator PERSON that has leverage. Frankly, the entire party also needs to quote, unquote, worry about that more moderate agenda in the ORG, because just as we have an extremely slim ORG margin, we also have a very slim ORG margin. And I, as well as many, many members of the progressive caucus, simply will not vote for Senator PERSON's infrastructure bill unless it is tied together with the Build Back Better Act so that we have an all of the above approach. So we are not saying it is either your bill or our bill, but that both of these bills must move forward together or neither will. And for the NORP people, that is the best case scenario, where we are able to address the needs of all communities, instead of just the needs of some communities that are represented by a very small sliver of that bipartisan group. I do not want to put you on the spot, but you mentioned fossil fuel industries. It reminded me of something you had tweeted actually when Senator PERSON voiced his opposition in an op-ed DATE. You responded via Twitter. On DATE, you wrote, PERSON has DATE huddles w/ ORG and is CARDINAL of many senators who gives lobbyists their pen to write so-called 'bipartisan' fossil fuel bills. It is killing people. Sick of this 'bipartisan' corruption that masquerades as clear-eyed moderation. Fossil fuel corps & dark money is destroying our democracy, country, & planet. DATE our community has been pulling bodies out of homes from the flood. And we are supposed to entertain lobbyist talking points about why we should abandoned people & do nothing? Are you suggesting that Senator PERSON is more interested in pleasing lobbyists than in saving lives from climate change? I think that in DATE, if any member of ORG, whether it is a member of the ORG or whether it is a member of the ORG, continues to aid the fossil fuel lobbyists in advancing their agenda over the consensus of science then they are disconnected from the reality on the ground. What we have been doing over DATE, first responders in my community, have been pulling out bodies from apartments, basement apartments in GPE because of these flash floods. And the idea that we are going to continue building fossil fuel infrastructure, that we are going to continue, even in my backyard, continue to try to build things like peaker plants, natural gas, fracking, pipelines for fracked gas, it is unconscionable. We know that the science is in and it says the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure will endanger people. We have the capacity to transition to clean and renewable energy and create CARDINAL of good union jobs in order to transition to both our infrastructure and our energy system, as well as our power grid. So I do believe that with all of that evidence that we have, with all of the opportunity that we have, economic opportunity that we have, if we continue to listen to the fossil fuel lobby and if we continue to allow them to have this infrastructure, have this influence in GPE, we are endangering our constituents, and we have to choose the science for once ahead of the lobbyist money. Do you support nuclear? Because there are a lot of people who will look at this issue and say the capabilities of transporting solar and wind power, I mean, our electrical grid needs to completely be altered and upgraded, but even then transporting it long distances and storing it, nuclear is the only answer, at least for in the short term. We have even addressed some of this issue, Senator PERSON and I, in the drafting of the Green New Deal, which is that I do not think that There is no position in terms of whether we are pro or anti-nuclear. Can we get an energy mix that is constructed in a DATE timeline in accordance with the ORG results? And so it certainly does not rule out nuclear, but the issue is, is the construction, the timeline, and making sure that we can also focus on investments, for example, battery storage and energy storage in our power grid so that we are not completely reliant on continual generation, but that we can store energy in times when it is not available. Just lastly, I want to ask you about something that GPE Governor PERSON just said. He was asked about the GPE abortion bill and why force a rape or incest victim survivor to carry a pregnancy to term? I want to play this for our viewers. I am wondering what you thought when you heard that? CARDINAL, I do not know if he is familiar with a menstruating person's body. In fact, I do know that he is not familiar with a female or a menstruating person's body, because if he did, he would know that you do not have DATE, is that quote, unquote DATE, and I am sorry we have to break down biology 101 on national television, but in case no one has informed him before in his life, DATE pregnant means DATE late for your period. And DATE late on your period for any person, any person with a menstrual cycle can happen if you are stressed, if your diet changes, or for really no reason at all. So you do not have DATE. The second area of this, when he talks about going after rapists and this language that he uses about getting rapists off the streets, the majority of people who are raped and who are sexually assaulted are assaulted by someone that they know. And these are not predators that are walking around the streets at TIME. And when something like that happens, it takes a very long time, first of all, for any victim to come forward. And second of all, when a victim comes forward, they do not necessarily want to bring their case into the carceral system. They do not want to retraumatize themselves by going to court. They do not necessarily all want to report a family friend to a police precinct, let alone in the immediate aftermath of the trauma of a sexual assault. And so while some victims do use that recourse and that is something that is completely available, and if that is part of their process, that is great, but this idea that we are going to quote, unquote end rape when the same type of frankly rape culture and the same type of misogynistic culture that informed this abortion law to begin with is also Those beliefs are held by the Governor himself and ORG, frankly, there are many people in power, as we know from the ORG movement, that commits sexual assault, that help their friends cover up these crimes. And some of them even serve in the same state legislatures that are voting on just these anti-choice bills. And he speaks from such a place of deep ignorance. It is ignorance that is hurting people across this country. You said rape culture and misogynistic culture are behind this GPE bill to begin with. Could you just explain that, how you feel about that to people? So when we talk about the law that was passed in GPE, we know that anti-choice bills are not about being pro-life, because if they were about being pro-life, then ORG would support, frankly, an agenda that helps guaranteed healthcare, that helps ensure that people who do give birth that do not have the resources to care for a child can have that care for a child. So we know that none of this is about life. None of this is about supporting life. What this is about is controlling women's bodies and controlling people who are not cisgender men. This is about making sure that someone like me as a woman or any menstruating person in this country cannot make decisions over their own body. And people like Governor PERSON and PERSON wants to have more control over a woman's body than that woman or that person has over themselves. And that shares with rape culture is that sexual assault is about the abuse of power and sexual assault is about asserting control over another person. And the ease with which these men seek to do that to other people is atrocious. It is morally reprehensible, and they cannot even begin to understand the agonizing decisions that people have to make, including in cases of miscarriage, rape and incest.

{"id": 5, "text": "Let us bring in the Speaker of the ORG, ENTITY. I know there is still a lot of votes to be counted and, anyway, we have a lot of news to get to. But before we get to that, I just wanted to ask, how is your husband, PERSON, doing? He is DATE after another, he is improving. It will take a little while. But we have been so comforted by the outpouring of so many prayers and good wishes and even people saying, 'I was not going to vote, but now I am going to vote because this has gone too far.' I will convey that to him. You know, we last spoke in DATE. You were confident then that the NORP would do well, kind of a lonely voice at that time, given high inflation and President PERSON's low approval ratings. How did NORP do it? Well, first of all, thank you for acknowledging that we had a different approach. It was not anything that we ever accepted when the pundits in GPE said we could not win because history, history, history. Elections are about the future. I am very proud of our candidates, both our incumbents as well as our Red to Blue candidates. They never accepted the punditry that they could not win, they had courage, they had purpose, and they understood their district. They also rejected calls from GPE about, 'Oh, your message should change.' No, our message was clear - People Over Politics, lower costs, bigger paychecks, safer communities. And they knew the value of a woman's right to choose, they knew how important it was to protect our democracy, they knew the contrast between themselves and their opponents, and that is what made them win. It was not about GPE said 'you should change your message,' GPE says 'you cannot win.' I hope that is a lesson, because really it depresses the vote sometimes when people say 'it is all over' DATE before the election. We never accepted that. Now the road to keeping the NORP Majority is still quite narrow. NORP have to run the table on the toss-up races still out there to keep control of the ORG. Do you see a realistic path to victory? And I give tribute, of course, to our candidates, I also give credit to our grassroots. This - they are our VIPs, our volunteers in politics, CARDINAL of doors knocked, CARDINAL of doors knocked. So they crossed a threshold. They leapfrogged over all the projections - the predictions and the rest. Whatever the outcome, we are on the path to taking our country to a better place than with being dragged down by the other side. I am disappointed with what happened in GPE, that CARDINAL votes could make the difference at TIME. But we have not - we have not given up, and we have not given up because the quality of our candidates, the purpose of our why, why this is important, and President PERSON did a great job presenting about our democracy being on the ballot. So it took a great deal to get to where we are, and we will just see. I said before, and you have heard me say on our walk in the park, it is like the Olympics. In TIME, you can be a gold, silver, bronze or honored to be an NORP. But, again, we are very proud of the outcome, and we are very proud because it was a victory For The People, not the punditry, but For The People, as well as the success in GPE is a personal joy for some of us because of PERSON. The President, we have ORG, we have the ORG, and we are going to have a big strong vote in the ORG, a very different outcome than some would have predicted. And if NORP keep the Majority, will you run again for Speaker? I am not - right now, I have said I am not making any comments until this election is finished, and we have a little more time to go. I wish it - It is going to take some time to count those votes in GPE, I know. Your NORP counterpart, PERSON, it looks like even if NORP do prevail, we are going to be talking about CARDINAL, CARDINAL, maybe CARDINAL votes in the ORG. Can he govern with that kind of a Majority? Well, it depends on their purpose. In our ORG, we had that kind of - those kinds of numbers. But we were united - we were very united in terms of being there for the - GPE's working families, that dominated our discussion - although we have our differences of opinion on certain issues, when it came down to the main purpose of the NORP, GPE's working families, there was no question that we would win every vote that we would - took to the Floor. And this new - the new Members coming in, again, a constant reinvigoration of the ORG that our founders intended. They will be speaking so clearly to it. We have CARDINAL of the youngest Members, Congressman-to-be PERSON, coming in, and it is - it is pretty exciting for us. It is about what the message and purpose will be demonstrated to the NORP people. And, again, it is about our democracy. Our democracy was on the ballot. Our planet was on the ballot. Personal freedom was on the ballot. These CARDINAL issues very important to young voters, and they were very important in our success in this election. Whatever the outcome, you said DATE, quote, 'We need to unify, I think it is really important to restore unity to ORG.' What steps do NORP need to take to bring the country together? Well, we have always been taking that step because we honor our oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and that should be a unifying principle for us. The - when, many of our bills, we worked very hard to make it bipartisan, bipartisan, bipartisan. With it, you can accomplish almost anything. And the point I want to make is, when the public knows what is at stake and what is happening there, I think we will see more cooperation, again, working together to produce a bill, but not having people vote no, take the dough, and make it look like we do not have bipartisanship, when, in fact, in the bills we do, but in the votes, not necessarily. Before the new ORG is sworn in in DATE, you have a lot of work in what would be a lame duck session in DATE. Probably at the top of that list, extending the debt limit because NORP have said, if they get the Majority, they are going to try to force concessions from NORP in order to extend the debt limit. Do you believe you can get a permanent or a very large extension of the debt limit during the lame duck session? I think it is important to note that what the NORP have said is they are going to use the vote on the debt limit as leverage to cut ORG and ORG. I think the public should know that. It is a difference of opinion, and I think the public should know who is on their side on all of this. We cannot allow them to cut ORG. People paid into it, and the NORP cannot use it as leverage to say, 'We will only lift the debt ceiling if you will reduce the benefits for our seniors and others on ORG and ORG.' But our best shot I think is to do it - to do it now. But again, winning the ORG gave us a lot of leverage for how we go forward if we do not do it in the lame duck. But my hope would be that we could get it done in the lame duck. The Constitution removes all doubt. The full faith and credit of GPE should not - is not in doubt. But this is a practice that we have engaged in. And so, we will have to, again, lift the debt ceiling so the full faith and credit of GPE is respected. When the NORP did this before, it lowered our credit rating. It lowered our credit rating - even though it did not eventually happen, but just the discussion of it. So this is - this is dealing with fire when we are talking about the stability of our credit rating. In the face of all this news, we see that PERSON is planning to announce for President again on DATE. Is that good news for NORP? I do not go into any discussion of his plans. I mean, I think it is bad news for the country, let us put it that way, because this is a person who has undermined the integrity of our elections, has not honored his oath of office, who has encouraged people, strange kind of people to run for office, who do not share the values of our democracy. They have said it very clearly in their statements. So he is not been a force for good. So, I do not think his candidacy is a force for good for our country. But that is up to the NORP to decide - to decide who they will choose. Understand this, we have very vast differences. NORP do not support science, so they disregard what we are saying about climate. They do not support governance, so they do not want to honor what science tells us in terms of the planet, in terms of health care and the rest. So, we have some very big differences. There is - the main event of it all is the Presidential. As important as our races are, if we were in GPE, we are the lounge act, they are - the Presidential is the main event, and this will be a very important election, very dispositive of the direction our country will go in. I mean President PERSON has been a great President for our country. He has accomplished so much. He has just done so many things that are so great. We need a lot more show to tell it. But he is put money in people's pockets, vaccines in their arms, children back to school, people back to work, for starters, creating CARDINAL jobs. He has made GPE independent by passing the CHIPS bill that says we are no longer reliant on those who would withhold products that enable us to manufacture in our country. The IRA - I just saw him make the speech in GPE where he spoke about GPE's commitment to preserving the planet with the legislation, the IRA, MONEY in good-paying green jobs, clean air, clean water for our children, national security issue to stop migrations and competition for habitat and food, as well as honoring our responsibility to future generations. The PACT Act, honoring our veterans, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, all of it with justice, with equity, with inclusiveness, with diversity, taking us to a new place. He has been a great President, and he has a great record to run on. Finally, ENTITY, if you do decide to step away from ORG, how do you want your Speakerships to be remembered? Well, I do not have any plans to step away from ORG. I do not - you asked me about running for Leadership. The - well, my flagship issue has - from the start of my being in ORG has been the climate issue. But in the course of things we - when we had the opportunity to expand health care for all NORP, that has to be my major accomplishment. I take great pride in that. I take great pride in saving it from those who wanted to repeal it. You'd have to ask them. That - PERSON said, 'Of all the inequalities, the inequity in access to health care is the most inhuman,' he said, 'because people can die.' So I thank God for giving me the opportunity to play a role in that. And it is an ongoing role to pass it, to protect it, to expand it. But I take pride in so much else. But I do not take credit for it. My Members, the courage of the Members, the ORG NORP, to vote for this - it is easy for me coming from the beautiful place that I do, GPE, harder for others. And it is their courage that made so much of this possible. So, I am so glad that we had a great - we increased - just dispelled the notion that NORP could not win. But we are on a path to a brighter future for GPE. And I am very proud of our Members, our candidates, their courage and their purpose and their success.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "pelosihousegovnewspressreleasestranscriptofpelosiinterviewonabcsthisweekwithgeorgestephanopoulos4", "title": "Transcript of Pelosi Interview on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos", "source": "https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/transcript-of-pelosi-interview-on-abcs-this-week-with-george-stephanopoulos-4", "publication_date": "13-11-2022", "crawling_date": "28-06-2023", "politician": ["Nancy Pelosi"], "gender": ["F"]}}
{"id": 5, "text": "Let us bring in the Speaker of the ORG, ENTITY. I know there is still a lot of votes to be counted and, anyway, we have a lot of news to get to. But before we get to that, I just wanted to ask, how is your husband, PERSON, doing? He is DATE after another, he is improving. It will take a little while. But we have been so comforted by the outpouring of so many prayers and good wishes and even people saying, 'I was not going to vote, but now I am going to vote because this has gone too far.' I will convey that to him. You know, we last spoke in DATE. You were confident then that the NORP would do well, kind of a lonely voice at that time, given high inflation and President PERSON's low approval ratings. How did NORP do it? Well, first of all, thank you for acknowledging that we had a different approach. It was not anything that we ever accepted when the pundits in GPE said we could not win because history, history, history. Elections are about the future. I am very proud of our candidates, both our incumbents as well as our Red to Blue candidates. They never accepted the punditry that they could not win, they had courage, they had purpose, and they understood their district. They also rejected calls from GPE about, 'Oh, your message should change.' No, our message was clear - People Over Politics, lower costs, bigger paychecks, safer communities. And they knew the value of a woman's right to choose, they knew how important it was to protect our democracy, they knew the contrast between themselves and their opponents, and that is what made them win. It was not about GPE said 'you should change your message,' GPE says 'you cannot win.' I hope that is a lesson, because really it depresses the vote sometimes when people say 'it is all over' DATE before the election. We never accepted that. Now the road to keeping the NORP Majority is still quite narrow. NORP have to run the table on the toss-up races still out there to keep control of the ORG. Do you see a realistic path to victory? And I give tribute, of course, to our candidates, I also give credit to our grassroots. This - they are our VIPs, our volunteers in politics, CARDINAL of doors knocked, CARDINAL of doors knocked. So they crossed a threshold. They leapfrogged over all the projections - the predictions and the rest. Whatever the outcome, we are on the path to taking our country to a better place than with being dragged down by the other side. I am disappointed with what happened in GPE, that CARDINAL votes could make the difference at TIME. But we have not - we have not given up, and we have not given up because the quality of our candidates, the purpose of our why, why this is important, and President PERSON did a great job presenting about our democracy being on the ballot. So it took a great deal to get to where we are, and we will just see. I said before, and you have heard me say on our walk in the park, it is like the Olympics.

It was not anything that we ever accepted when the pundits in GPE said we could not win because history, history, history. Elections are about the future. I am very proud of our candidates, both our incumbents as well as our Red to Blue candidates. They never accepted the punditry that they could not win, they had courage, they had purpose, and they understood their district. They also rejected calls from GPE about, 'Oh, your message should change.' No, our message was clear - People Over Politics, lower costs, bigger paychecks, safer communities. And they knew the value of a woman's right to choose, they knew how important it was to protect our democracy, they knew the contrast between themselves and their opponents, and that is what made them win. It was not about GPE said 'you should change your message,' GPE says 'you cannot win.' I hope that is a lesson, because really it depresses the vote sometimes when people say 'it is all over' DATE before the election. We never accepted that. Now the road to keeping the NORP Majority is still quite narrow. NORP have to run the table on the toss-up races still out there to keep control of the ORG. Do you see a realistic path to victory? And I give tribute, of course, to our candidates, I also give credit to our grassroots. This - they are our VIPs, our volunteers in politics, CARDINAL of doors knocked, CARDINAL of doors knocked. So they crossed a threshold. They leapfrogged over all the projections - the predictions and the rest. Whatever the outcome, we are on the path to taking our country to a better place than with being dragged down by the other side. I am disappointed with what happened in GPE, that CARDINAL votes could make the difference at TIME. But we have not - we have not given up, and we have not given up because the quality of our candidates, the purpose of our why, why this is important, and President PERSON did a great job presenting about our democracy being on the ballot. So it took a great deal to get to where we are, and we will just see. I said before, and you have heard me say on our walk in the park, it is like the Olympics. In TIME, you can be a gold, silver, bronze or honored to be an NORP. But, again, we are very proud of the outcome, and we are very proud because it was a victory For The People, not the punditry, but For The People, as well as the success in GPE is a personal joy for some of us because of PERSON. The President, we have ORG, we have the ORG, and we are going to have a big strong vote in the ORG, a very different outcome than some would have predicted. And if NORP keep the Majority, will you run again for Speaker? I am not - right now, I have said I am not making any comments until this election is finished, and we have a little more time to go. I wish it - It is going to take some time to count those votes in GPE, I know. Your NORP counterpart, PERSON, it looks like even if NORP do prevail, we are going to be talking about CARDINAL, CARDINAL, maybe CARDINAL votes in the ORG. Can he govern with that kind of a Majority? Well, it depends on their purpose. In our ORG, we had that kind of - those kinds of numbers. But we were united - we were very united in terms of being there for the - GPE's working families, that dominated our discussion - although we have our differences of opinion on certain issues, when it came down to the main purpose of the NORP, GPE's working families, there was no question that we would win every vote that we would - took to the Floor. And this new - the new Members coming in, again, a constant reinvigoration of the ORG that our founders intended. They will be speaking so clearly to it. We have CARDINAL of the youngest Members, Congressman-to-be PERSON, coming in, and it is - it is pretty exciting for us. It is about what the message and purpose will be demonstrated to the NORP people. And, again, it is about our democracy. Our democracy was on the ballot. Our planet was on the ballot. Personal freedom was on the ballot. These CARDINAL issues very important to young voters, and they were very important in our success in this election. Whatever the outcome, you said DATE, quote, 'We need to unify, I think it is really important to restore unity to ORG.' What steps do NORP need to take to bring the country together? Well, we have always been taking that step because we honor our oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and that should be a unifying principle for us. The - when, many of our bills, we worked very hard to make it bipartisan, bipartisan, bipartisan. With it, you can accomplish almost anything. And the point I want to make is, when the public knows what is at stake and what is happening there, I think we will see more cooperation, again, working together to produce a bill, but not having people vote no, take the dough, and make it look like we do not have bipartisanship, when, in fact, in the bills we do, but in the votes, not necessarily. Before the new ORG is sworn in in DATE, you have a lot of work in what would be a lame duck session in DATE. Probably at the top of that list, extending the debt limit because NORP have said, if they get the Majority, they are going to try to force concessions from NORP in order to extend the debt limit. Do you believe you can get a permanent or a very large extension of the debt limit during the lame duck session? I think it is important to note that what the NORP have said is they are going to use the vote on the debt limit as leverage to cut ORG and ORG. I think the public should know that. It is a difference of opinion, and I think the public should know who is on their side on all of this. We cannot allow them to cut ORG. People paid into it, and the NORP cannot use it as leverage to say, 'We will only lift the debt ceiling if you will reduce the benefits for our seniors and others on ORG and ORG.' But our best shot I think is to do it - to do it now. But again, winning the ORG gave us a lot of leverage for how we go forward if we do not do it in the lame duck. But my hope would be that we could get it done in the lame duck. The Constitution removes all doubt. The full faith and credit of GPE should not - is not in doubt. But this is a practice that we have engaged in. And so, we will have to, again, lift the debt ceiling so the full faith and credit of GPE is respected. When the NORP did this before, it lowered our credit rating. It lowered our credit rating - even though it did not eventually happen, but just the discussion of it. So this is - this is dealing with fire when we are talking about the stability of our credit rating. In the face of all this news, we see that PERSON is planning to announce for President again on DATE. Is that good news for NORP? I do not go into any discussion of his plans. I mean, I think it is bad news for the country, let us put it that way, because this is a person who has undermined the integrity of our elections, has not honored his oath of office, who has encouraged people, strange kind of people to run for office, who do not share the values of our democracy. They have said it very clearly in their statements. So he is not been a force for good. So, I do not think his candidacy is a force for good for our country. But that is up to the NORP to decide - to decide who they will choose. Understand this, we have very vast differences. NORP do not support science, so they disregard what we are saying about climate. They do not support governance, so they do not want to honor what science tells us in terms of the planet, in terms of health care and the rest. So, we have some very big differences. There is - the main event of it all is the Presidential. As important as our races are, if we were in GPE, we are the lounge act, they are - the Presidential is the main event, and this will be a very important election, very dispositive of the direction our country will go in. I mean President PERSON has been a great President for our country. He has accomplished so much. He has just done so many things that are so great. We need a lot more show to tell it. But he is put money in people's pockets, vaccines in their arms, children back to school, people back to work, for starters, creating CARDINAL jobs. He has made GPE independent by passing the CHIPS bill that says we are no longer reliant on those who would withhold products that enable us to manufacture in our country. The IRA - I just saw him make the speech in GPE where he spoke about GPE's commitment to preserving the planet with the legislation, the IRA, MONEY in good-paying green jobs, clean air, clean water for our children, national security issue to stop migrations and competition for habitat and food, as well as honoring our responsibility to future generations. The PACT Act, honoring our veterans, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, all of it with justice, with equity, with inclusiveness, with diversity, taking us to a new place. He has been a great President, and he has a great record to run on. Finally, ENTITY, if you do decide to step away from ORG, how do you want your Speakerships to be remembered? Well, I do not have any plans to step away from ORG. I do not - you asked me about running for Leadership. The - well, my flagship issue has - from the start of my being in ORG has been the climate issue. But in the course of things we - when we had the opportunity to expand health care for all NORP, that has to be my major accomplishment. I take great pride in that. I take great pride in saving it from those who wanted to repeal it. You'd have to ask them. That - PERSON said, 'Of all the inequalities, the inequity in access to health care is the most inhuman,' he said, 'because people can die.' So I thank God for giving me the opportunity to play a role in that. And it is an ongoing role to pass it, to protect it, to expand it. But I take pride in so much else. But I do not take credit for it. My Members, the courage of the Members, the ORG NORP, to vote for this - it is easy for me coming from the beautiful place that I do, GPE, harder for others. And it is their courage that made so much of this possible. So, I am so glad that we had a great - we increased - just dispelled the notion that NORP could not win. But we are on a path to a brighter future for GPE. And I am very proud of our Members, our candidates, their courage and their purpose and their success.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "pelosihousegovnewspressreleasestranscriptofpelosiinterviewonabcsthisweekwithgeorgestephanopoulos4", "title": "Transcript of Pelosi Interview on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos", "source": "https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/transcript-of-pelosi-interview-on-abcs-this-week-with-george-stephanopoulos-4", "publication_date": "13-11-2022", "crawling_date": "28-06-2023", "politician": ["Nancy Pelosi"], "gender": ["F"]}}

{"id": 6, "text": "Right now, I'd like to bring in the Speaker of the ORG, ENTITY. thank you so much for joining us and, I want to say thank you. You set aside MONEY in emergency loans for small businesses. People across this country need it. But, already DATE, the head of ORG said that we would need MONEY to meet small business demand. Well, this is MONEY on top of the $MONEY that we had done DATE. I think it is all in the execution. As the Secretary of the ORG says, let us see how this works and where our needs are. But first, let me just say, watching your report and the rest, how much we pray for everyone in our country, those who have lost their lives. When businesses are opening, I think that is unfortunate because we are not protecting the investment that we have made, but that is a choice. And I pray for those people, too, that they do not get sick. And we have the lives at stake and we have the livelihoods at stake. the entrepreneurship of GPE, the optimism of it all, the courage to start a small business. And we really need to help them. So, we are all committed to that. We were very pleased in our last bill that we expanded that opportunity. The so-called underbanked, those who would have less possibility of being first in line with some of the banks. And so, in any event, let us see how this goes. But, we have to do other things. It is about jobs, jobs, jobs. And the issue is that we have to have state and local. the health care workers, the first responders, police, fire, emergency services, people transportation, food, the postal service and the rest. Those are jobs, too, and when you open up your business, you want to have customers. You can have the rent paid and employees paid and electricity - the utility bill paid, but you still have to have customers. So, we want to, again, make sure that these people who are risking their lives to save other people's lives are not risking their jobs as well because the state and localities cannot pay them. It is not about bureaucracy. It is about delivery of service to the NORP people. So, we want to have a vitality throughout our economy. We may have to think in terms of some different ways to put money in people's pockets. But we know that the needs are massive in terms of economically. From a health perspective, we are preparing people to live without a vaccine for DATE, but from an economic perspective, look at PPP. Even with all this money, we are only creating solutions for DATE. DATE, when the majority of these businesses do not open back up, then what? Well, I think we should extend the time. I think we should extend the time. I think what you suggest makes all the sense in the world. what is operational and what needs other attention. Others have suggested a minimum income for - a guaranteed income for people. Is that worthy of attention now? Perhaps so, because there are many more people than just in small business and hired by small business, as important as that is to the vitality of our economy. And other people who are not in the public sector, you know, meeting our needs in so many ways, that may need some assistance as well. But we are talking about the lives of the NORP people. And, again, the pull and push of should we open up or not, if it jeopardizes the lives of the NORP people, we have to handle it with care. What is the execution of it? And what is - what are we getting our money's worth on? I think we have to look at that, too. With all the best intentions in the world, but nonetheless, we want the money to go where it needs. there are CARDINAL things that I hear from the NORP people, from - by way of my constituents, but also the constituents of CARDINAL of Members of ORG. They know they are risking their lives to save other lives and, now, they are risking their jobs, as I mentioned. Secondly, they want their check. They want their direct payment check, their unemployment check or they want their small business - their PPP check. They want their check. And, third, they do not want any of this MONEY that we are injecting into the economy, that some of which goes to major corporations, any of that money to be use for anything other than keeping people in their jobs. They do not want any buybacks, corporate whatever, dividends, bonuses, CEO pay, the rest of that. That really angers the NORP people. It is sort of a hangover from the Great Recession. So, it is important that we have oversight to see exactly how all of this is spent. Not in a pointing a blame - point the fingers, but just to make sure everybody knows that there will be transparency and there will be accountability. I agree with you wholeheartedly, but then I have to impress upon you, it is the government's responsibility to do that. As it relates to ORG, it is the media who has outed all of these companies who took the money. It was the media who talked about hedge funds and private equity firms and law firms taking the money. The government sets the rules, ma'am. And we passed the law, but the Executive branch puts forth the advisories and the regulation. So, when I suggested to the Secretary of the ORG some of the concerns we have about what you have just described, he said, 'Well, I am the one who put out the list. They would not have known that had I not put out the list.' So, I guess that was his way of saying, 'Let us all take a look at this as we go forth.' They make a world of difference, life and death to the survival of a company, for some companies, and others really do not need it that much. And we have to take a look at how banks are compensated. They get a higher percentage for a small loan. But if you get PERCENT on a $MONEY loan, that is a lot less than getting PERCENT on a MONEY loan, and again, is that right? And others - just to subject everything to the scrutiny that needs to be done for the taxpayer dollars and how they are spent. I think we have to do what we need to do. Others are talking about the deficit - 'Oh, the national debt.' Well, they never talked about the national debt when they spent MONEY for a tax bill to get PERCENT of the benefits to the top one percent in our country. I do not like building the national debt, but a lot of what we are doing is stimulus. Food stamps are stimulus, even though we cannot get them to agree with us on that. Then let us break down all of these issues because the idea DATE that angered so many people was that bigger companies with other access to capital were using PPP. But the idea of PPP is ORG, and if you no longer want some of these larger businesses in there, what are you going to do, A, to help them? And, B, you know they are going to lay off CARDINAL of workers, especially restaurant chains. Well, look, I come from a city of GPE. Hospitality - we have a diversity in our economy in GPE, hospitality being a very important part of it. But it is important in many places throughout the country, actually throughout the whole country as I am finding out. And we really do have to address that, as if they are not being able to get the same kind of small business loan, perhaps in some cases, again, as you said, we have to extend the time. But in some cases, we have to also perhaps expand it to CARDINAL people rather than CARDINAL. That would help some non-profits, which we hope would be able to participate in all of this. But they are larger in number and lower in pay that they pay people. There is some limitations on what can be done in that regard. I have spoken to the Chairman of the ORG about that and, of course, to the Secretary of the ORG. where are these dollars are going and what is it in there that is, in a sense of decency, that the banks and the bigger businesses who really do not need it have deeper pockets, a longer survival capacity than some of the small businesses which will be gone, as you said, DATE. Many of them will disappear, never to return from what they are telling me. So again, we all join together for PPP. We believe in that, but, again, we want to make sure it works. If we scrutinize it after the fact when time is so essential, we could lose businesses, and right now we are arguing over which businesses need it most. With the exception of just very few businesses, most industries across the country are in desperate need. Do we have to start to focus and say, does the federal government need to just take over payroll, create mortgage deferment or just say we need to create a national economic holiday until it is safe? Because right now, we are bickering over who is suffering more. I think it is a legitimate discussion of, again, when we passed - I saw you had the leader of their Floor debate on our bill we passed DATE, on there saying, 'We could have done this DATE.' They could have agreed to the additional - they had $MONEY . We brought it up to $MONEY . And when we brought it up to $MONEY , it had MONEY for hospitals and testing in there, which is essential to our opening up. But we also had MONEY for smaller businesses, which are getting left in the shade, and that just was not right. So, it is not a question of bickering. It is about establishing priorities, and we have a differences between our parties. The gentleman that you interviewed, Mr. PERSON, he said on ORG, 'We could have done this DATE, except they had extracurricular stuff.' Extracurricular stuff? CARDINAL for small businesses, more in terms of the EIDL loans, which are flying out the door because they are easier to get for businesses. They have a longer - a long-term and a low interest rate, so they are very appealing. And the grants and aid that never do have to be paid back, in addition to MONEY more for PPP. So, we have to be smart about this. What they rejected DATE, they passed unanimously in the ORG and overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan way, in the ORG. Every bill we have passed has been bipartisan, but we have had to make the case about lower-income, smaller businesses, again, women, minority - we do not want to put any - prioritize anybody over anybody else because it is about jobs. You know it is about jobs. No matter where you work, it is about jobs. So, if that business needs the infusion to keep people on the job, then that is what this is about. But it also has to not ossify any disparity of access to credit in our country, which does exist. So, we want everybody to enjoy the vitality of it all. you had said on DATE that you were disappointed that the banks did not act as better stewards. Banks are going to protect themselves because that is what they have to do, and they asked the government to release them of some of their risk review requirements because, if what the banks did was give loans very quickly to borrowers who they did not know, if those were not good loans, those banks could be on the hook DATE. If the government wanted it done differently, why would not the government do it itself? The ORG, they know how to collect our money. They could give the money out. Well, it was a decision that Secretary of the ORG made to go through the banks for facilitation, that perhaps it would be faster to do than to go through a SBA - a ORG process. In my - I do not want banks to be made villains in this. They are facilitators, and this should be something we go forward with in a very positive way. It is interesting, though, that they make a lot of money off of it and, therefore, it could affect their behavior in all of it. But what I had said is, with the fact the ORG has kissed this loan, there is no risk. And as well as the ORG enabling them to not have this count. If I may, the reason for the delay, if I may, the reason for the delay, the banks need to do a risk review process. After they do that, they then go to the ORG. CARDINAL of the main reasons for the hold-up, banks did not have to do a very long risk review for clients that they already knew. That is one of the reasons it went so quickly. For new borrowers, it took some more time. So they are on the hook before they go to the ORG. These banks lived through this in DATE. They did not make good decisions and they paid for it after. If they did that again, they'd get annihilated. Well, I would say that in DATE, they were part of the problem. I do not see that this time. But let me say that that is why it was hard to understand why our NORP colleagues were not embracing our initiative of MONEY that would go to community development financial institutions. So those institutions who know the neighborhood, who know the community, know the customers, know the businesses, know the culture would be able to make loans, smaller loans, into the community. I thought it was really something that they would welcome because, therefore, those who know that community better would be meeting their needs. Will they get to go before the big banks to make sure the money goes to the small borrowers? And the Secretary has been very - working very hard in my view, when I talked to him about it, he said, 'We are working it, we are working it.' So that these portals, or whatever, are for that community. The $MONEY is already going to the ORG. This is additional and specific to that community. But also, MONEY in EIDL loans, the Emergency Injury Loans, and that is MONEY leveraged to MONEY in loans. No matter how big you are or how small you are, people like the long-term, low interest and the immediacy of getting that. So, that was a very important part of this as well. And then we have the grants that every small business can apply for. But you have said it very clearly. Is it number of employees? Is it length of time? Is it in terms of non-profits, the 501, , ? Let us see how we can expand this. Because we could actually, with the combination of all of these things, be reaching maybe PERCENT of all the small businesses in GPE. And that would be a wonderful thing because, again, the entrepreneurship, the vitality, the courage, the optimism to start a small business. And then people have them for DATE and then you see their hopes just fade because of something so beyond their control. So, make no mistake, this is central. That is why we made it the centerpiece of the first - of the first distribution of funds into the business community. We also had a big program for those aerospace industry, airline industry, which, again, in order to keep people on the job, they received - the Secretary has the discretion to spend a great deal of money there, but we do not want to see any of that money squandered on anything other than job retention because that is what the point of all of this is. And that is how people are going to be able to spend in the economy, have consumer confidence, be able to meet the needs of their families, as we deal with the suffering that is going with this. So, in this next bill, we will be supporting vote by mail in a very important way. We think it is a health issue, at this point. And I did not want to leave this conversation without mentioning the importance of the life, the livelihood - the life of our people, the livelihood of themselves and our economy and the life of our democracy. NORP business needs it. I appreciate all that everyone in our government is doing right now to help us in this trying time.

{"id": 6, "text": "Right now, I'd like to bring in the Speaker of the ORG, ENTITY. thank you so much for joining us and, I want to say thank you. You set aside MONEY in emergency loans for small businesses. People across this country need it. But, already DATE, the head of ORG said that we would need MONEY to meet small business demand. Well, this is MONEY on top of the $MONEY that we had done DATE. I think it is all in the execution. As the Secretary of the ORG says, let us see how this works and where our needs are. But first, let me just say, watching your report and the rest, how much we pray for everyone in our country, those who have lost their lives. When businesses are opening, I think that is unfortunate because we are not protecting the investment that we have made, but that is a choice. And I pray for those people, too, that they do not get sick. And we have the lives at stake and we have the livelihoods at stake. the entrepreneurship of GPE, the optimism of it all, the courage to start a small business. And we really need to help them. So, we are all committed to that. We were very pleased in our last bill that we expanded that opportunity. The so-called underbanked, those who would have less possibility of being first in line with some of the banks. And so, in any event, let us see how this goes. But, we have to do other things. It is about jobs, jobs, jobs. And the issue is that we have to have state and local. the health care workers, the first responders, police, fire, emergency services, people transportation, food, the postal service and the rest. Those are jobs, too, and when you open up your business, you want to have customers. You can have the rent paid and employees paid and electricity - the utility bill paid, but you still have to have customers. So, we want to, again, make sure that these people who are risking their lives to save other people's lives are not risking their jobs as well because the state and localities cannot pay them. It is not about bureaucracy. It is about delivery of service to the NORP people. So, we want to have a vitality throughout our economy. We may have to think in terms of some different ways to put money in people's pockets. But we know that the needs are massive in terms of economically. From a health perspective, we are preparing people to live without a vaccine for DATE, but from an economic perspective, look at PPP. Even with all this money, we are only creating solutions for DATE. DATE, when the majority of these businesses do not open back up, then what? Well, I think we should extend the time. I think we should extend the time. I think what you suggest makes all the sense in the world. what is operational and what needs other attention. Others have suggested a minimum income for - a guaranteed income for people. Is that worthy of attention now? Perhaps so, because there are many more people than just in small business and hired by small business, as important as that is to the vitality of our economy. And other people who are not in the public sector, you know, meeting our needs in so many ways, that may need some assistance as well. But we are talking about the lives of the NORP people. And, again, the pull and push of should we open up or not, if it jeopardizes the lives of the NORP people, we have to handle it with care. What is the execution of it? And what is - what are we getting our money's worth on? I think we have to look at that, too. With all the best intentions in the world, but nonetheless, we want the money to go where it needs. there are CARDINAL things that I hear from the NORP people, from - by way of my constituents, but also the constituents of CARDINAL of Members of ORG. They know they are risking their lives to save other lives and, now, they are risking their jobs, as I mentioned. Secondly, they want their check. They want their direct payment check, their unemployment check or they want their small business - their PPP check. They want their check. And, third, they do not want any of this MONEY that we are injecting into the economy, that some of which goes to major corporations, any of that money to be use for anything other than keeping people in their jobs. They do not want any buybacks, corporate whatever, dividends, bonuses, CEO pay, the rest of that. That really angers the NORP people. It is sort of a hangover from the Great Recession. So, it is important that we have oversight to see exactly how all of this is spent. Not in a pointing a blame - point the fingers, but just to make sure everybody knows that there will be transparency and there will be accountability. I agree with you wholeheartedly, but then I have to impress upon you, it is the government's responsibility to do that. As it relates to ORG, it is the media who has outed all of these companies who took the money. It was the media who talked about hedge funds and private equity firms and law firms taking the money. The government sets the rules, ma'am. And we passed the law, but the Executive branch puts forth the advisories and the regulation. So, when I suggested to the Secretary of the ORG some of the concerns we have about what you have just described, he said, 'Well, I am the one who put out the list. They would not have known that had I not put out the list.' So, I guess that was his way of saying, 'Let us all take a look at this as we go forth.' They make a world of difference, life and death to the survival of a company, for some companies, and others really do not need it that much. And we have to take a look at how banks are compensated. They get a higher percentage for a small loan. But if you get PERCENT on a $MONEY loan, that is a lot less than getting PERCENT on a MONEY loan, and again, is that right? And others - just to subject everything to the scrutiny that needs to be done for the taxpayer dollars and how they are spent. I think we have to do what we need to do. Others are talking about the deficit - 'Oh, the national debt.' Well, they never talked about the national debt when they spent MONEY for a tax bill to get PERCENT of the benefits to the top one percent in our country. I do not like building the national debt, but a lot of what we are doing is stimulus. Food stamps are stimulus, even though we cannot get them to agree with us on that. Then let us break down all of these issues because the idea DATE that angered so many people was that bigger companies with other access to capital were using PPP. But the idea of PPP is ORG, and if you no longer want some of these larger businesses in there, what are you going to do, A, to help them? And, B, you know they are going to lay off CARDINAL of workers, especially restaurant chains. Well, look, I come from a city of GPE. Hospitality - we have a diversity in our economy in GPE, hospitality being a very important part of it. But it is important in many places throughout the country, actually throughout the whole country as I am finding out. And we really do have to address that, as if they are not being able to get the same kind of small business loan, perhaps in some cases, again, as you said, we have to extend the time. But in some cases, we have to also perhaps expand it to CARDINAL people rather than CARDINAL. That would help some non-profits, which we hope would be able to participate in all of this. But they are larger in number and lower in pay that they pay people. There is some limitations on what can be done in that regard. I have spoken to the Chairman of the ORG about that and, of course, to the Secretary of the ORG. where are these dollars are going and what is it in there that is, in a sense of decency, that the banks and the bigger businesses who really do not need it have deeper pockets, a longer survival capacity than some of the small businesses which will be gone, as you said, DATE. Many of them will disappear, never to return from what they are telling me. So again, we all join together for PPP. We believe in that, but, again, we want to make sure it works. If we scrutinize it after the fact when time is so essential, we could lose businesses, and right now we are arguing over which businesses need it most. With the exception of just very few businesses, most industries across the country are in desperate need. Do we have to start to focus and say, does the federal government need to just take over payroll, create mortgage deferment or just say we need to create a national economic holiday until it is safe? Because right now, we are bickering over who is suffering more. I think it is a legitimate discussion of, again, when we passed - I saw you had the leader of their Floor debate on our bill we passed DATE, on there saying, 'We could have done this DATE.' They could have agreed to the additional - they had $MONEY . We brought it up to $MONEY . And when we brought it up to $MONEY , it had MONEY for hospitals and testing in there, which is essential to our opening up. But we also had MONEY for smaller businesses, which are getting left in the shade, and that just was not right. So, it is not a question of bickering. It is about establishing priorities, and we have a differences between our parties. The gentleman that you interviewed, Mr. PERSON, he said on ORG, 'We could have done this DATE, except they had extracurricular stuff.' Extracurricular stuff? CARDINAL for small businesses, more in terms of the EIDL loans, which are flying out the door because they are easier to get for businesses. They have a longer - a long-term and a low interest rate, so they are very appealing. And the grants and aid that never do have to be paid back, in addition to MONEY more for PPP. So, we have to be smart about this. What they rejected DATE, they passed unanimously in the ORG and overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan way, in the ORG. Every bill we have passed has been bipartisan, but we have had to make the case about lower-income, smaller businesses, again, women, minority - we do not want to put any - prioritize anybody over anybody else because it is about jobs. You know it is about jobs. No matter where you work, it is about jobs. So, if that business needs the infusion to keep people on the job, then that is what this is about. But it also has to not ossify any disparity of access to credit in our country, which does exist. So, we want everybody to enjoy the vitality of it all. you had said on DATE that you were disappointed that the banks did not act as better stewards. Banks are going to protect themselves because that is what they have to do, and they asked the government to release them of some of their risk review requirements because, if what the banks did was give loans very quickly to borrowers who they did not know, if those were not good loans, those banks could be on the hook DATE.

And then we have the grants that every small business can apply for. But you have said it very clearly. Is it number of employees? Is it length of time? Is it in terms of non-profits, the 501, , ? Let us see how we can expand this. Because we could actually, with the combination of all of these things, be reaching maybe PERCENT of all the small businesses in GPE. And that would be a wonderful thing because, again, the entrepreneurship, the vitality, the courage, the optimism to start a small business. And then people have them for DATE and then you see their hopes just fade because of something so beyond their control. So, make no mistake, this is central. That is why we made it the centerpiece of the first - of the first distribution of funds into the business community. We also had a big program for those aerospace industry, airline industry, which, again, in order to keep people on the job, they received - the Secretary has the discretion to spend a great deal of money there, but we do not want to see any of that money squandered on anything other than job retention because that is what the point of all of this is. And that is how people are going to be able to spend in the economy, have consumer confidence, be able to meet the needs of their families, as we deal with the suffering that is going with this. So, in this next bill, we will be supporting vote by mail in a very important way. We think it is a health issue, at this point. And I did not want to leave this conversation without mentioning the importance of the life, the livelihood - the life of our people, the livelihood of themselves and our economy and the life of our democracy. NORP business needs it. I appreciate all that everyone in our government is doing right now to help us in this trying time.

{"id": 6, "text": "Right now, I'd like to bring in the Speaker of the ORG, ENTITY. thank you so much for joining us and, I want to say thank you. You set aside MONEY in emergency loans for small businesses. People across this country need it. But, already DATE, the head of ORG said that we would need MONEY to meet small business demand. Well, this is MONEY on top of the $MONEY that we had done DATE. I think it is all in the execution. As the Secretary of the ORG says, let us see how this works and where our needs are. But first, let me just say, watching your report and the rest, how much we pray for everyone in our country, those who have lost their lives. When businesses are opening, I think that is unfortunate because we are not protecting the investment that we have made, but that is a choice. And I pray for those people, too, that they do not get sick. And we have the lives at stake and we have the livelihoods at stake. the entrepreneurship of GPE, the optimism of it all, the courage to start a small business. And we really need to help them. So, we are all committed to that. We were very pleased in our last bill that we expanded that opportunity. The so-called underbanked, those who would have less possibility of being first in line with some of the banks. And so, in any event, let us see how this goes. But, we have to do other things. It is about jobs, jobs, jobs. And the issue is that we have to have state and local. the health care workers, the first responders, police, fire, emergency services, people transportation, food, the postal service and the rest. Those are jobs, too, and when you open up your business, you want to have customers. You can have the rent paid and employees paid and electricity - the utility bill paid, but you still have to have customers. So, we want to, again, make sure that these people who are risking their lives to save other people's lives are not risking their jobs as well because the state and localities cannot pay them. It is not about bureaucracy. It is about delivery of service to the NORP people. So, we want to have a vitality throughout our economy. We may have to think in terms of some different ways to put money in people's pockets. But we know that the needs are massive in terms of economically. From a health perspective, we are preparing people to live without a vaccine for DATE, but from an economic perspective, look at PPP. Even with all this money, we are only creating solutions for DATE. DATE, when the majority of these businesses do not open back up, then what? Well, I think we should extend the time. I think we should extend the time. I think what you suggest makes all the sense in the world. what is operational and what needs other attention. Others have suggested a minimum income for - a guaranteed income for people. Is that worthy of attention now? Perhaps so, because there are many more people than just in small business and hired by small business, as important as that is to the vitality of our economy. And other people who are not in the public sector, you know, meeting our needs in so many ways, that may need some assistance as well. But we are talking about the lives of the NORP people. And, again, the pull and push of should we open up or not, if it jeopardizes the lives of the NORP people, we have to handle it with care. What is the execution of it? And what is - what are we getting our money's worth on? I think we have to look at that, too. With all the best intentions in the world, but nonetheless, we want the money to go where it needs. there are CARDINAL things that I hear from the NORP people, from - by way of my constituents, but also the constituents of CARDINAL of Members of ORG. They know they are risking their lives to save other lives and, now, they are risking their jobs, as I mentioned. Secondly, they want their check. They want their direct payment check, their unemployment check or they want their small business - their PPP check. They want their check. And, third, they do not want any of this MONEY that we are injecting into the economy, that some of which goes to major corporations, any of that money to be use for anything other than keeping people in their jobs. They do not want any buybacks, corporate whatever, dividends, bonuses, CEO pay, the rest of that. That really angers the NORP people. It is sort of a hangover from the Great Recession. So, it is important that we have oversight to see exactly how all of this is spent. Not in a pointing a blame - point the fingers, but just to make sure everybody knows that there will be transparency and there will be accountability. I agree with you wholeheartedly, but then I have to impress upon you, it is the government's responsibility to do that. As it relates to ORG, it is the media who has outed all of these companies who took the money. It was the media who talked about hedge funds and private equity firms and law firms taking the money. The government sets the rules, ma'am. And we passed the law, but the Executive branch puts forth the advisories and the regulation. So, when I suggested to the Secretary of the ORG some of the concerns we have about what you have just described, he said, 'Well, I am the one who put out the list. They would not have known that had I not put out the list.' So, I guess that was his way of saying, 'Let us all take a look at this as we go forth.' They make a world of difference, life and death to the survival of a company, for some companies, and others really do not need it that much. And we have to take a look at how banks are compensated. They get a higher percentage for a small loan. But if you get PERCENT on a $MONEY loan, that is a lot less than getting PERCENT on a MONEY loan, and again, is that right? And others - just to subject everything to the scrutiny that needs to be done for the taxpayer dollars and how they are spent. I think we have to do what we need to do. Others are talking about the deficit - 'Oh, the national debt.' Well, they never talked about the national debt when they spent MONEY for a tax bill to get PERCENT of the benefits to the top one percent in our country. I do not like building the national debt, but a lot of what we are doing is stimulus. Food stamps are stimulus, even though we cannot get them to agree with us on that. Then let us break down all of these issues because the idea DATE that angered so many people was that bigger companies with other access to capital were using PPP. But the idea of PPP is ORG, and if you no longer want some of these larger businesses in there, what are you going to do, A, to help them? And, B, you know they are going to lay off CARDINAL of workers, especially restaurant chains. Well, look, I come from a city of GPE. Hospitality - we have a diversity in our economy in GPE, hospitality being a very important part of it. But it is important in many places throughout the country, actually throughout the whole country as I am finding out. And we really do have to address that, as if they are not being able to get the same kind of small business loan, perhaps in some cases, again, as you said, we have to extend the time. But in some cases, we have to also perhaps expand it to CARDINAL people rather than CARDINAL. That would help some non-profits, which we hope would be able to participate in all of this. But they are larger in number and lower in pay that they pay people. There is some limitations on what can be done in that regard. I have spoken to the Chairman of the ORG about that and, of course, to the Secretary of the ORG. where are these dollars are going and what is it in there that is, in a sense of decency, that the banks and the bigger businesses who really do not need it have deeper pockets, a longer survival capacity than some of the small businesses which will be gone, as you said, DATE. Many of them will disappear, never to return from what they are telling me. So again, we all join together for PPP. We believe in that, but, again, we want to make sure it works. If we scrutinize it after the fact when time is so essential, we could lose businesses, and right now we are arguing over which businesses need it most. With the exception of just very few businesses, most industries across the country are in desperate need. Do we have to start to focus and say, does the federal government need to just take over payroll, create mortgage deferment or just say we need to create a national economic holiday until it is safe? Because right now, we are bickering over who is suffering more. I think it is a legitimate discussion of, again, when we passed - I saw you had the leader of their Floor debate on our bill we passed DATE, on there saying, 'We could have done this DATE.' They could have agreed to the additional - they had $MONEY . We brought it up to $MONEY . And when we brought it up to $MONEY , it had MONEY for hospitals and testing in there, which is essential to our opening up. But we also had MONEY for smaller businesses, which are getting left in the shade, and that just was not right. So, it is not a question of bickering. It is about establishing priorities, and we have a differences between our parties. The gentleman that you interviewed, Mr. PERSON, he said on ORG, 'We could have done this DATE, except they had extracurricular stuff.' Extracurricular stuff? CARDINAL for small businesses, more in terms of the EIDL loans, which are flying out the door because they are easier to get for businesses. They have a longer - a long-term and a low interest rate, so they are very appealing. And the grants and aid that never do have to be paid back, in addition to MONEY more for PPP. So, we have to be smart about this. What they rejected DATE, they passed unanimously in the ORG and overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan way, in the ORG. Every bill we have passed has been bipartisan, but we have had to make the case about lower-income, smaller businesses, again, women, minority - we do not want to put any - prioritize anybody over anybody else because it is about jobs. You know it is about jobs. No matter where you work, it is about jobs. So, if that business needs the infusion to keep people on the job, then that is what this is about. But it also has to not ossify any disparity of access to credit in our country, which does exist. So, we want everybody to enjoy the vitality of it all. you had said on DATE that you were disappointed that the banks did not act as better stewards. Banks are going to protect themselves because that is what they have to do, and they asked the government to release them of some of their risk review requirements because, if what the banks did was give loans very quickly to borrowers who they did not know, if those were not good loans, those banks could be on the hook DATE. If the government wanted it done differently, why would not the government do it itself? The ORG, they know how to collect our money. They could give the money out. Well, it was a decision that Secretary of the ORG made to go through the banks for facilitation, that perhaps it would be faster to do than to go through a SBA - a ORG process. In my - I do not want banks to be made villains in this. They are facilitators, and this should be something we go forward with in a very positive way. It is interesting, though, that they make a lot of money off of it and, therefore, it could affect their behavior in all of it. But what I had said is, with the fact the ORG has kissed this loan, there is no risk. And as well as the ORG enabling them to not have this count. If I may, the reason for the delay, if I may, the reason for the delay, the banks need to do a risk review process. After they do that, they then go to the ORG. CARDINAL of the main reasons for the hold-up, banks did not have to do a very long risk review for clients that they already knew. That is one of the reasons it went so quickly. For new borrowers, it took some more time. So they are on the hook before they go to the ORG. These banks lived through this in DATE. They did not make good decisions and they paid for it after. If they did that again, they'd get annihilated. Well, I would say that in DATE, they were part of the problem. I do not see that this time. But let me say that that is why it was hard to understand why our NORP colleagues were not embracing our initiative of MONEY that would go to community development financial institutions. So those institutions who know the neighborhood, who know the community, know the customers, know the businesses, know the culture would be able to make loans, smaller loans, into the community. I thought it was really something that they would welcome because, therefore, those who know that community better would be meeting their needs. Will they get to go before the big banks to make sure the money goes to the small borrowers? And the Secretary has been very - working very hard in my view, when I talked to him about it, he said, 'We are working it, we are working it.' So that these portals, or whatever, are for that community. The $MONEY is already going to the ORG. This is additional and specific to that community. But also, MONEY in EIDL loans, the Emergency Injury Loans, and that is MONEY leveraged to MONEY in loans. No matter how big you are or how small you are, people like the long-term, low interest and the immediacy of getting that. So, that was a very important part of this as well.

You set aside MONEY in emergency loans for small businesses. People across this country need it. But, already DATE, the head of ORG said that we would need MONEY to meet small business demand. Well, this is MONEY on top of the $MONEY that we had done DATE. I think it is all in the execution. As the Secretary of the ORG says, let us see how this works and where our needs are. But first, let me just say, watching your report and the rest, how much we pray for everyone in our country, those who have lost their lives. When businesses are opening, I think that is unfortunate because we are not protecting the investment that we have made, but that is a choice. And I pray for those people, too, that they do not get sick. And we have the lives at stake and we have the livelihoods at stake. the entrepreneurship of GPE, the optimism of it all, the courage to start a small business. And we really need to help them. So, we are all committed to that. We were very pleased in our last bill that we expanded that opportunity. The so-called underbanked, those who would have less possibility of being first in line with some of the banks. And so, in any event, let us see how this goes. But, we have to do other things. It is about jobs, jobs, jobs. And the issue is that we have to have state and local. the health care workers, the first responders, police, fire, emergency services, people transportation, food, the postal service and the rest. Those are jobs, too, and when you open up your business, you want to have customers. You can have the rent paid and employees paid and electricity - the utility bill paid, but you still have to have customers. So, we want to, again, make sure that these people who are risking their lives to save other people's lives are not risking their jobs as well because the state and localities cannot pay them. It is not about bureaucracy. It is about delivery of service to the NORP people. So, we want to have a vitality throughout our economy. We may have to think in terms of some different ways to put money in people's pockets. But we know that the needs are massive in terms of economically. From a health perspective, we are preparing people to live without a vaccine for DATE, but from an economic perspective, look at PPP. Even with all this money, we are only creating solutions for DATE. DATE, when the majority of these businesses do not open back up, then what? Well, I think we should extend the time. I think we should extend the time. I think what you suggest makes all the sense in the world. what is operational and what needs other attention. Others have suggested a minimum income for - a guaranteed income for people. Is that worthy of attention now? Perhaps so, because there are many more people than just in small business and hired by small business, as important as that is to the vitality of our economy. And other people who are not in the public sector, you know, meeting our needs in so many ways, that may need some assistance as well. But we are talking about the lives of the NORP people. And, again, the pull and push of should we open up or not, if it jeopardizes the lives of the NORP people, we have to handle it with care. What is the execution of it? And what is - what are we getting our money's worth on? I think we have to look at that, too. With all the best intentions in the world, but nonetheless, we want the money to go where it needs. there are CARDINAL things that I hear from the NORP people, from - by way of my constituents, but also the constituents of CARDINAL of Members of ORG. They know they are risking their lives to save other lives and, now, they are risking their jobs, as I mentioned. Secondly, they want their check. They want their direct payment check, their unemployment check or they want their small business - their PPP check. They want their check. And, third, they do not want any of this MONEY that we are injecting into the economy, that some of which goes to major corporations, any of that money to be use for anything other than keeping people in their jobs. They do not want any buybacks, corporate whatever, dividends, bonuses, CEO pay, the rest of that. That really angers the NORP people. It is sort of a hangover from the Great Recession. So, it is important that we have oversight to see exactly how all of this is spent. Not in a pointing a blame - point the fingers, but just to make sure everybody knows that there will be transparency and there will be accountability. I agree with you wholeheartedly, but then I have to impress upon you, it is the government's responsibility to do that. As it relates to ORG, it is the media who has outed all of these companies who took the money. It was the media who talked about hedge funds and private equity firms and law firms taking the money. The government sets the rules, ma'am. And we passed the law, but the Executive branch puts forth the advisories and the regulation. So, when I suggested to the Secretary of the ORG some of the concerns we have about what you have just described, he said, 'Well, I am the one who put out the list. They would not have known that had I not put out the list.' So, I guess that was his way of saying, 'Let us all take a look at this as we go forth.' They make a world of difference, life and death to the survival of a company, for some companies, and others really do not need it that much. And we have to take a look at how banks are compensated. They get a higher percentage for a small loan. But if you get PERCENT on a $MONEY loan, that is a lot less than getting PERCENT on a MONEY loan, and again, is that right? And others - just to subject everything to the scrutiny that needs to be done for the taxpayer dollars and how they are spent. I think we have to do what we need to do. Others are talking about the deficit - 'Oh, the national debt.' Well, they never talked about the national debt when they spent MONEY for a tax bill to get PERCENT of the benefits to the top one percent in our country. I do not like building the national debt, but a lot of what we are doing is stimulus. Food stamps are stimulus, even though we cannot get them to agree with us on that. Then let us break down all of these issues because the idea DATE that angered so many people was that bigger companies with other access to capital were using PPP. But the idea of PPP is ORG, and if you no longer want some of these larger businesses in there, what are you going to do, A, to help them? And, B, you know they are going to lay off CARDINAL of workers, especially restaurant chains. Well, look, I come from a city of GPE. Hospitality - we have a diversity in our economy in GPE, hospitality being a very important part of it. But it is important in many places throughout the country, actually throughout the whole country as I am finding out. And we really do have to address that, as if they are not being able to get the same kind of small business loan, perhaps in some cases, again, as you said, we have to extend the time. But in some cases, we have to also perhaps expand it to CARDINAL people rather than CARDINAL. That would help some non-profits, which we hope would be able to participate in all of this. But they are larger in number and lower in pay that they pay people. There is some limitations on what can be done in that regard. I have spoken to the Chairman of the ORG about that and, of course, to the Secretary of the ORG. where are these dollars are going and what is it in there that is, in a sense of decency, that the banks and the bigger businesses who really do not need it have deeper pockets, a longer survival capacity than some of the small businesses which will be gone, as you said, DATE. Many of them will disappear, never to return from what they are telling me. So again, we all join together for PPP. We believe in that, but, again, we want to make sure it works. If we scrutinize it after the fact when time is so essential, we could lose businesses, and right now we are arguing over which businesses need it most. With the exception of just very few businesses, most industries across the country are in desperate need. Do we have to start to focus and say, does the federal government need to just take over payroll, create mortgage deferment or just say we need to create a national economic holiday until it is safe? Because right now, we are bickering over who is suffering more. I think it is a legitimate discussion of, again, when we passed - I saw you had the leader of their Floor debate on our bill we passed DATE, on there saying, 'We could have done this DATE.' They could have agreed to the additional - they had $MONEY . We brought it up to $MONEY . And when we brought it up to $MONEY , it had MONEY for hospitals and testing in there, which is essential to our opening up. But we also had MONEY for smaller businesses, which are getting left in the shade, and that just was not right. So, it is not a question of bickering. It is about establishing priorities, and we have a differences between our parties. The gentleman that you interviewed, Mr. PERSON, he said on ORG, 'We could have done this DATE, except they had extracurricular stuff.' Extracurricular stuff? CARDINAL for small businesses, more in terms of the EIDL loans, which are flying out the door because they are easier to get for businesses. They have a longer - a long-term and a low interest rate, so they are very appealing. And the grants and aid that never do have to be paid back, in addition to MONEY more for PPP. So, we have to be smart about this. What they rejected DATE, they passed unanimously in the ORG and overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan way, in the ORG. Every bill we have passed has been bipartisan, but we have had to make the case about lower-income, smaller businesses, again, women, minority - we do not want to put any - prioritize anybody over anybody else because it is about jobs. You know it is about jobs. No matter where you work, it is about jobs. So, if that business needs the infusion to keep people on the job, then that is what this is about. But it also has to not ossify any disparity of access to credit in our country, which does exist. So, we want everybody to enjoy the vitality of it all. you had said on DATE that you were disappointed that the banks did not act as better stewards. Banks are going to protect themselves because that is what they have to do, and they asked the government to release them of some of their risk review requirements because, if what the banks did was give loans very quickly to borrowers who they did not know, if those were not good loans, those banks could be on the hook DATE. If the government wanted it done differently, why would not the government do it itself? The ORG, they know how to collect our money. They could give the money out. Well, it was a decision that Secretary of the ORG made to go through the banks for facilitation, that perhaps it would be faster to do than to go through a SBA - a ORG process. In my - I do not want banks to be made villains in this. They are facilitators, and this should be something we go forward with in a very positive way. It is interesting, though, that they make a lot of money off of it and, therefore, it could affect their behavior in all of it. But what I had said is, with the fact the ORG has kissed this loan, there is no risk. And as well as the ORG enabling them to not have this count. If I may, the reason for the delay, if I may, the reason for the delay, the banks need to do a risk review process. After they do that, they then go to the ORG. CARDINAL of the main reasons for the hold-up, banks did not have to do a very long risk review for clients that they already knew. That is one of the reasons it went so quickly. For new borrowers, it took some more time. So they are on the hook before they go to the ORG. These banks lived through this in DATE. They did not make good decisions and they paid for it after. If they did that again, they'd get annihilated. Well, I would say that in DATE, they were part of the problem. I do not see that this time. But let me say that that is why it was hard to understand why our NORP colleagues were not embracing our initiative of MONEY that would go to community development financial institutions. So those institutions who know the neighborhood, who know the community, know the customers, know the businesses, know the culture would be able to make loans, smaller loans, into the community. I thought it was really something that they would welcome because, therefore, those who know that community better would be meeting their needs. Will they get to go before the big banks to make sure the money goes to the small borrowers? And the Secretary has been very - working very hard in my view, when I talked to him about it, he said, 'We are working it, we are working it.' So that these portals, or whatever, are for that community. The $MONEY is already going to the ORG. This is additional and specific to that community. But also, MONEY in EIDL loans, the Emergency Injury Loans, and that is MONEY leveraged to MONEY in loans. No matter how big you are or how small you are, people like the long-term, low interest and the immediacy of getting that. So, that was a very important part of this as well. And then we have the grants that every small business can apply for. But you have said it very clearly. Is it number of employees? Is it length of time? Is it in terms of non-profits, the 501, , ? Let us see how we can expand this. Because we could actually, with the combination of all of these things, be reaching maybe PERCENT of all the small businesses in GPE. And that would be a wonderful thing because, again, the entrepreneurship, the vitality, the courage, the optimism to start a small business. And then people have them for DATE and then you see their hopes just fade because of something so beyond their control. So, make no mistake, this is central. That is why we made it the centerpiece of the first - of the first distribution of funds into the business community. We also had a big program for those aerospace industry, airline industry, which, again, in order to keep people on the job, they received - the Secretary has the discretion to spend a great deal of money there, but we do not want to see any of that money squandered on anything other than job retention because that is what the point of all of this is. And that is how people are going to be able to spend in the economy, have consumer confidence, be able to meet the needs of their families, as we deal with the suffering that is going with this. So, in this next bill, we will be supporting vote by mail in a very important way. We think it is a health issue, at this point. And I did not want to leave this conversation without mentioning the importance of the life, the livelihood - the life of our people, the livelihood of themselves and our economy and the life of our democracy. NORP business needs it. I appreciate all that everyone in our government is doing right now to help us in this trying time.

We may have to think in terms of some different ways to put money in people's pockets. But we know that the needs are massive in terms of economically. From a health perspective, we are preparing people to live without a vaccine for DATE, but from an economic perspective, look at PPP. Even with all this money, we are only creating solutions for DATE. DATE, when the majority of these businesses do not open back up, then what? Well, I think we should extend the time. I think we should extend the time. I think what you suggest makes all the sense in the world. what is operational and what needs other attention. Others have suggested a minimum income for - a guaranteed income for people. Is that worthy of attention now? Perhaps so, because there are many more people than just in small business and hired by small business, as important as that is to the vitality of our economy. And other people who are not in the public sector, you know, meeting our needs in so many ways, that may need some assistance as well. But we are talking about the lives of the NORP people. And, again, the pull and push of should we open up or not, if it jeopardizes the lives of the NORP people, we have to handle it with care. What is the execution of it? And what is - what are we getting our money's worth on? I think we have to look at that, too. With all the best intentions in the world, but nonetheless, we want the money to go where it needs. there are CARDINAL things that I hear from the NORP people, from - by way of my constituents, but also the constituents of CARDINAL of Members of ORG. They know they are risking their lives to save other lives and, now, they are risking their jobs, as I mentioned. Secondly, they want their check. They want their direct payment check, their unemployment check or they want their small business - their PPP check. They want their check. And, third, they do not want any of this MONEY that we are injecting into the economy, that some of which goes to major corporations, any of that money to be use for anything other than keeping people in their jobs. They do not want any buybacks, corporate whatever, dividends, bonuses, CEO pay, the rest of that. That really angers the NORP people. It is sort of a hangover from the Great Recession. So, it is important that we have oversight to see exactly how all of this is spent. Not in a pointing a blame - point the fingers, but just to make sure everybody knows that there will be transparency and there will be accountability. I agree with you wholeheartedly, but then I have to impress upon you, it is the government's responsibility to do that. As it relates to ORG, it is the media who has outed all of these companies who took the money. It was the media who talked about hedge funds and private equity firms and law firms taking the money. The government sets the rules, ma'am. And we passed the law, but the Executive branch puts forth the advisories and the regulation. So, when I suggested to the Secretary of the ORG some of the concerns we have about what you have just described, he said, 'Well, I am the one who put out the list. They would not have known that had I not put out the list.' So, I guess that was his way of saying, 'Let us all take a look at this as we go forth.' They make a world of difference, life and death to the survival of a company, for some companies, and others really do not need it that much. And we have to take a look at how banks are compensated. They get a higher percentage for a small loan. But if you get PERCENT on a $MONEY loan, that is a lot less than getting PERCENT on a MONEY loan, and again, is that right? And others - just to subject everything to the scrutiny that needs to be done for the taxpayer dollars and how they are spent. I think we have to do what we need to do. Others are talking about the deficit - 'Oh, the national debt.' Well, they never talked about the national debt when they spent MONEY for a tax bill to get PERCENT of the benefits to the top one percent in our country. I do not like building the national debt, but a lot of what we are doing is stimulus. Food stamps are stimulus, even though we cannot get them to agree with us on that. Then let us break down all of these issues because the idea DATE that angered so many people was that bigger companies with other access to capital were using PPP. But the idea of PPP is ORG, and if you no longer want some of these larger businesses in there, what are you going to do, A, to help them? And, B, you know they are going to lay off CARDINAL of workers, especially restaurant chains. Well, look, I come from a city of GPE. Hospitality - we have a diversity in our economy in GPE, hospitality being a very important part of it. But it is important in many places throughout the country, actually throughout the whole country as I am finding out. And we really do have to address that, as if they are not being able to get the same kind of small business loan, perhaps in some cases, again, as you said, we have to extend the time. But in some cases, we have to also perhaps expand it to CARDINAL people rather than CARDINAL. That would help some non-profits, which we hope would be able to participate in all of this. But they are larger in number and lower in pay that they pay people. There is some limitations on what can be done in that regard. I have spoken to the Chairman of the ORG about that and, of course, to the Secretary of the ORG. where are these dollars are going and what is it in there that is, in a sense of decency, that the banks and the bigger businesses who really do not need it have deeper pockets, a longer survival capacity than some of the small businesses which will be gone, as you said, DATE. Many of them will disappear, never to return from what they are telling me. So again, we all join together for PPP. We believe in that, but, again, we want to make sure it works. If we scrutinize it after the fact when time is so essential, we could lose businesses, and right now we are arguing over which businesses need it most. With the exception of just very few businesses, most industries across the country are in desperate need. Do we have to start to focus and say, does the federal government need to just take over payroll, create mortgage deferment or just say we need to create a national economic holiday until it is safe? Because right now, we are bickering over who is suffering more. I think it is a legitimate discussion of, again, when we passed - I saw you had the leader of their Floor debate on our bill we passed DATE, on there saying, 'We could have done this DATE.' They could have agreed to the additional - they had $MONEY . We brought it up to $MONEY . And when we brought it up to $MONEY , it had MONEY for hospitals and testing in there, which is essential to our opening up. But we also had MONEY for smaller businesses, which are getting left in the shade, and that just was not right. So, it is not a question of bickering. It is about establishing priorities, and we have a differences between our parties. The gentleman that you interviewed, Mr. PERSON, he said on ORG, 'We could have done this DATE, except they had extracurricular stuff.' Extracurricular stuff? CARDINAL for small businesses, more in terms of the EIDL loans, which are flying out the door because they are easier to get for businesses. They have a longer - a long-term and a low interest rate, so they are very appealing. And the grants and aid that never do have to be paid back, in addition to MONEY more for PPP. So, we have to be smart about this. What they rejected DATE, they passed unanimously in the ORG and overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan way, in the ORG. Every bill we have passed has been bipartisan, but we have had to make the case about lower-income, smaller businesses, again, women, minority - we do not want to put any - prioritize anybody over anybody else because it is about jobs. You know it is about jobs. No matter where you work, it is about jobs. So, if that business needs the infusion to keep people on the job, then that is what this is about. But it also has to not ossify any disparity of access to credit in our country, which does exist. So, we want everybody to enjoy the vitality of it all. you had said on DATE that you were disappointed that the banks did not act as better stewards. Banks are going to protect themselves because that is what they have to do, and they asked the government to release them of some of their risk review requirements because, if what the banks did was give loans very quickly to borrowers who they did not know, if those were not good loans, those banks could be on the hook DATE. If the government wanted it done differently, why would not the government do it itself? The ORG, they know how to collect our money. They could give the money out. Well, it was a decision that Secretary of the ORG made to go through the banks for facilitation, that perhaps it would be faster to do than to go through a SBA - a ORG process. In my - I do not want banks to be made villains in this. They are facilitators, and this should be something we go forward with in a very positive way. It is interesting, though, that they make a lot of money off of it and, therefore, it could affect their behavior in all of it. But what I had said is, with the fact the ORG has kissed this loan, there is no risk. And as well as the ORG enabling them to not have this count. If I may, the reason for the delay, if I may, the reason for the delay, the banks need to do a risk review process. After they do that, they then go to the ORG. CARDINAL of the main reasons for the hold-up, banks did not have to do a very long risk review for clients that they already knew. That is one of the reasons it went so quickly. For new borrowers, it took some more time. So they are on the hook before they go to the ORG. These banks lived through this in DATE. They did not make good decisions and they paid for it after. If they did that again, they'd get annihilated. Well, I would say that in DATE, they were part of the problem. I do not see that this time. But let me say that that is why it was hard to understand why our NORP colleagues were not embracing our initiative of MONEY that would go to community development financial institutions. So those institutions who know the neighborhood, who know the community, know the customers, know the businesses, know the culture would be able to make loans, smaller loans, into the community. I thought it was really something that they would welcome because, therefore, those who know that community better would be meeting their needs. Will they get to go before the big banks to make sure the money goes to the small borrowers? And the Secretary has been very - working very hard in my view, when I talked to him about it, he said, 'We are working it, we are working it.' So that these portals, or whatever, are for that community. The $MONEY is already going to the ORG. This is additional and specific to that community. But also, MONEY in EIDL loans, the Emergency Injury Loans, and that is MONEY leveraged to MONEY in loans. No matter how big you are or how small you are, people like the long-term, low interest and the immediacy of getting that. So, that was a very important part of this as well. And then we have the grants that every small business can apply for. But you have said it very clearly. Is it number of employees? Is it length of time? Is it in terms of non-profits, the 501, , ? Let us see how we can expand this. Because we could actually, with the combination of all of these things, be reaching maybe PERCENT of all the small businesses in GPE. And that would be a wonderful thing because, again, the entrepreneurship, the vitality, the courage, the optimism to start a small business. And then people have them for DATE and then you see their hopes just fade because of something so beyond their control. So, make no mistake, this is central. That is why we made it the centerpiece of the first - of the first distribution of funds into the business community. We also had a big program for those aerospace industry, airline industry, which, again, in order to keep people on the job, they received - the Secretary has the discretion to spend a great deal of money there, but we do not want to see any of that money squandered on anything other than job retention because that is what the point of all of this is. And that is how people are going to be able to spend in the economy, have consumer confidence, be able to meet the needs of their families, as we deal with the suffering that is going with this. So, in this next bill, we will be supporting vote by mail in a very important way. We think it is a health issue, at this point. And I did not want to leave this conversation without mentioning the importance of the life, the livelihood - the life of our people, the livelihood of themselves and our economy and the life of our democracy. NORP business needs it. I appreciate all that everyone in our government is doing right now to help us in this trying time.

{"id": 6, "text": "Right now, I'd like to bring in the Speaker of the ORG, ENTITY. thank you so much for joining us and, I want to say thank you. You set aside MONEY in emergency loans for small businesses. People across this country need it. But, already DATE, the head of ORG said that we would need MONEY to meet small business demand. Well, this is MONEY on top of the $MONEY that we had done DATE. I think it is all in the execution. As the Secretary of the ORG says, let us see how this works and where our needs are. But first, let me just say, watching your report and the rest, how much we pray for everyone in our country, those who have lost their lives. When businesses are opening, I think that is unfortunate because we are not protecting the investment that we have made, but that is a choice. And I pray for those people, too, that they do not get sick. And we have the lives at stake and we have the livelihoods at stake. the entrepreneurship of GPE, the optimism of it all, the courage to start a small business. And we really need to help them. So, we are all committed to that. We were very pleased in our last bill that we expanded that opportunity. The so-called underbanked, those who would have less possibility of being first in line with some of the banks. And so, in any event, let us see how this goes. But, we have to do other things. It is about jobs, jobs, jobs. And the issue is that we have to have state and local. the health care workers, the first responders, police, fire, emergency services, people transportation, food, the postal service and the rest. Those are jobs, too, and when you open up your business, you want to have customers. You can have the rent paid and employees paid and electricity - the utility bill paid, but you still have to have customers.

As it relates to ORG, it is the media who has outed all of these companies who took the money. It was the media who talked about hedge funds and private equity firms and law firms taking the money. The government sets the rules, ma'am. And we passed the law, but the Executive branch puts forth the advisories and the regulation. So, when I suggested to the Secretary of the ORG some of the concerns we have about what you have just described, he said, 'Well, I am the one who put out the list. They would not have known that had I not put out the list.' So, I guess that was his way of saying, 'Let us all take a look at this as we go forth.' They make a world of difference, life and death to the survival of a company, for some companies, and others really do not need it that much. And we have to take a look at how banks are compensated. They get a higher percentage for a small loan. But if you get PERCENT on a $MONEY loan, that is a lot less than getting PERCENT on a MONEY loan, and again, is that right? And others - just to subject everything to the scrutiny that needs to be done for the taxpayer dollars and how they are spent. I think we have to do what we need to do. Others are talking about the deficit - 'Oh, the national debt.' Well, they never talked about the national debt when they spent MONEY for a tax bill to get PERCENT of the benefits to the top one percent in our country. I do not like building the national debt, but a lot of what we are doing is stimulus. Food stamps are stimulus, even though we cannot get them to agree with us on that. Then let us break down all of these issues because the idea DATE that angered so many people was that bigger companies with other access to capital were using PPP. But the idea of PPP is ORG, and if you no longer want some of these larger businesses in there, what are you going to do, A, to help them? And, B, you know they are going to lay off CARDINAL of workers, especially restaurant chains. Well, look, I come from a city of GPE. Hospitality - we have a diversity in our economy in GPE, hospitality being a very important part of it. But it is important in many places throughout the country, actually throughout the whole country as I am finding out. And we really do have to address that, as if they are not being able to get the same kind of small business loan, perhaps in some cases, again, as you said, we have to extend the time. But in some cases, we have to also perhaps expand it to CARDINAL people rather than CARDINAL. That would help some non-profits, which we hope would be able to participate in all of this. But they are larger in number and lower in pay that they pay people. There is some limitations on what can be done in that regard. I have spoken to the Chairman of the ORG about that and, of course, to the Secretary of the ORG. where are these dollars are going and what is it in there that is, in a sense of decency, that the banks and the bigger businesses who really do not need it have deeper pockets, a longer survival capacity than some of the small businesses which will be gone, as you said, DATE. Many of them will disappear, never to return from what they are telling me. So again, we all join together for PPP. We believe in that, but, again, we want to make sure it works. If we scrutinize it after the fact when time is so essential, we could lose businesses, and right now we are arguing over which businesses need it most. With the exception of just very few businesses, most industries across the country are in desperate need. Do we have to start to focus and say, does the federal government need to just take over payroll, create mortgage deferment or just say we need to create a national economic holiday until it is safe? Because right now, we are bickering over who is suffering more. I think it is a legitimate discussion of, again, when we passed - I saw you had the leader of their Floor debate on our bill we passed DATE, on there saying, 'We could have done this DATE.' They could have agreed to the additional - they had $MONEY . We brought it up to $MONEY . And when we brought it up to $MONEY , it had MONEY for hospitals and testing in there, which is essential to our opening up. But we also had MONEY for smaller businesses, which are getting left in the shade, and that just was not right. So, it is not a question of bickering. It is about establishing priorities, and we have a differences between our parties. The gentleman that you interviewed, Mr. PERSON, he said on ORG, 'We could have done this DATE, except they had extracurricular stuff.' Extracurricular stuff? CARDINAL for small businesses, more in terms of the EIDL loans, which are flying out the door because they are easier to get for businesses. They have a longer - a long-term and a low interest rate, so they are very appealing. And the grants and aid that never do have to be paid back, in addition to MONEY more for PPP. So, we have to be smart about this. What they rejected DATE, they passed unanimously in the ORG and overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan way, in the ORG. Every bill we have passed has been bipartisan, but we have had to make the case about lower-income, smaller businesses, again, women, minority - we do not want to put any - prioritize anybody over anybody else because it is about jobs. You know it is about jobs. No matter where you work, it is about jobs. So, if that business needs the infusion to keep people on the job, then that is what this is about. But it also has to not ossify any disparity of access to credit in our country, which does exist. So, we want everybody to enjoy the vitality of it all. you had said on DATE that you were disappointed that the banks did not act as better stewards. Banks are going to protect themselves because that is what they have to do, and they asked the government to release them of some of their risk review requirements because, if what the banks did was give loans very quickly to borrowers who they did not know, if those were not good loans, those banks could be on the hook DATE. If the government wanted it done differently, why would not the government do it itself? The ORG, they know how to collect our money. They could give the money out. Well, it was a decision that Secretary of the ORG made to go through the banks for facilitation, that perhaps it would be faster to do than to go through a SBA - a ORG process. In my - I do not want banks to be made villains in this. They are facilitators, and this should be something we go forward with in a very positive way. It is interesting, though, that they make a lot of money off of it and, therefore, it could affect their behavior in all of it. But what I had said is, with the fact the ORG has kissed this loan, there is no risk. And as well as the ORG enabling them to not have this count. If I may, the reason for the delay, if I may, the reason for the delay, the banks need to do a risk review process. After they do that, they then go to the ORG. CARDINAL of the main reasons for the hold-up, banks did not have to do a very long risk review for clients that they already knew. That is one of the reasons it went so quickly. For new borrowers, it took some more time. So they are on the hook before they go to the ORG. These banks lived through this in DATE. They did not make good decisions and they paid for it after. If they did that again, they'd get annihilated. Well, I would say that in DATE, they were part of the problem. I do not see that this time. But let me say that that is why it was hard to understand why our NORP colleagues were not embracing our initiative of MONEY that would go to community development financial institutions. So those institutions who know the neighborhood, who know the community, know the customers, know the businesses, know the culture would be able to make loans, smaller loans, into the community. I thought it was really something that they would welcome because, therefore, those who know that community better would be meeting their needs. Will they get to go before the big banks to make sure the money goes to the small borrowers? And the Secretary has been very - working very hard in my view, when I talked to him about it, he said, 'We are working it, we are working it.' So that these portals, or whatever, are for that community. The $MONEY is already going to the ORG. This is additional and specific to that community. But also, MONEY in EIDL loans, the Emergency Injury Loans, and that is MONEY leveraged to MONEY in loans. No matter how big you are or how small you are, people like the long-term, low interest and the immediacy of getting that. So, that was a very important part of this as well. And then we have the grants that every small business can apply for. But you have said it very clearly. Is it number of employees? Is it length of time? Is it in terms of non-profits, the 501, , ? Let us see how we can expand this. Because we could actually, with the combination of all of these things, be reaching maybe PERCENT of all the small businesses in GPE. And that would be a wonderful thing because, again, the entrepreneurship, the vitality, the courage, the optimism to start a small business. And then people have them for DATE and then you see their hopes just fade because of something so beyond their control. So, make no mistake, this is central. That is why we made it the centerpiece of the first - of the first distribution of funds into the business community. We also had a big program for those aerospace industry, airline industry, which, again, in order to keep people on the job, they received - the Secretary has the discretion to spend a great deal of money there, but we do not want to see any of that money squandered on anything other than job retention because that is what the point of all of this is. And that is how people are going to be able to spend in the economy, have consumer confidence, be able to meet the needs of their families, as we deal with the suffering that is going with this. So, in this next bill, we will be supporting vote by mail in a very important way. We think it is a health issue, at this point. And I did not want to leave this conversation without mentioning the importance of the life, the livelihood - the life of our people, the livelihood of themselves and our economy and the life of our democracy. NORP business needs it. I appreciate all that everyone in our government is doing right now to help us in this trying time.

{"id": 6, "text": "Right now, I'd like to bring in the Speaker of the ORG, ENTITY. thank you so much for joining us and, I want to say thank you. You set aside MONEY in emergency loans for small businesses. People across this country need it. But, already DATE, the head of ORG said that we would need MONEY to meet small business demand. Well, this is MONEY on top of the $MONEY that we had done DATE. I think it is all in the execution. As the Secretary of the ORG says, let us see how this works and where our needs are. But first, let me just say, watching your report and the rest, how much we pray for everyone in our country, those who have lost their lives. When businesses are opening, I think that is unfortunate because we are not protecting the investment that we have made, but that is a choice. And I pray for those people, too, that they do not get sick. And we have the lives at stake and we have the livelihoods at stake. the entrepreneurship of GPE, the optimism of it all, the courage to start a small business. And we really need to help them. So, we are all committed to that. We were very pleased in our last bill that we expanded that opportunity. The so-called underbanked, those who would have less possibility of being first in line with some of the banks. And so, in any event, let us see how this goes. But, we have to do other things. It is about jobs, jobs, jobs. And the issue is that we have to have state and local. the health care workers, the first responders, police, fire, emergency services, people transportation, food, the postal service and the rest. Those are jobs, too, and when you open up your business, you want to have customers. You can have the rent paid and employees paid and electricity - the utility bill paid, but you still have to have customers. So, we want to, again, make sure that these people who are risking their lives to save other people's lives are not risking their jobs as well because the state and localities cannot pay them. It is not about bureaucracy. It is about delivery of service to the NORP people. So, we want to have a vitality throughout our economy. We may have to think in terms of some different ways to put money in people's pockets. But we know that the needs are massive in terms of economically. From a health perspective, we are preparing people to live without a vaccine for DATE, but from an economic perspective, look at PPP. Even with all this money, we are only creating solutions for DATE. DATE, when the majority of these businesses do not open back up, then what? Well, I think we should extend the time. I think we should extend the time. I think what you suggest makes all the sense in the world. what is operational and what needs other attention. Others have suggested a minimum income for - a guaranteed income for people. Is that worthy of attention now? Perhaps so, because there are many more people than just in small business and hired by small business, as important as that is to the vitality of our economy. And other people who are not in the public sector, you know, meeting our needs in so many ways, that may need some assistance as well. But we are talking about the lives of the NORP people. And, again, the pull and push of should we open up or not, if it jeopardizes the lives of the NORP people, we have to handle it with care. What is the execution of it? And what is - what are we getting our money's worth on? I think we have to look at that, too. With all the best intentions in the world, but nonetheless, we want the money to go where it needs. there are CARDINAL things that I hear from the NORP people, from - by way of my constituents, but also the constituents of CARDINAL of Members of ORG. They know they are risking their lives to save other lives and, now, they are risking their jobs, as I mentioned. Secondly, they want their check. They want their direct payment check, their unemployment check or they want their small business - their PPP check. They want their check. And, third, they do not want any of this MONEY that we are injecting into the economy, that some of which goes to major corporations, any of that money to be use for anything other than keeping people in their jobs. They do not want any buybacks, corporate whatever, dividends, bonuses, CEO pay, the rest of that. That really angers the NORP people. It is sort of a hangover from the Great Recession. So, it is important that we have oversight to see exactly how all of this is spent. Not in a pointing a blame - point the fingers, but just to make sure everybody knows that there will be transparency and there will be accountability. I agree with you wholeheartedly, but then I have to impress upon you, it is the government's responsibility to do that.

But they are larger in number and lower in pay that they pay people. There is some limitations on what can be done in that regard. I have spoken to the Chairman of the ORG about that and, of course, to the Secretary of the ORG. where are these dollars are going and what is it in there that is, in a sense of decency, that the banks and the bigger businesses who really do not need it have deeper pockets, a longer survival capacity than some of the small businesses which will be gone, as you said, DATE. Many of them will disappear, never to return from what they are telling me. So again, we all join together for PPP. We believe in that, but, again, we want to make sure it works. If we scrutinize it after the fact when time is so essential, we could lose businesses, and right now we are arguing over which businesses need it most. With the exception of just very few businesses, most industries across the country are in desperate need. Do we have to start to focus and say, does the federal government need to just take over payroll, create mortgage deferment or just say we need to create a national economic holiday until it is safe? Because right now, we are bickering over who is suffering more. I think it is a legitimate discussion of, again, when we passed - I saw you had the leader of their Floor debate on our bill we passed DATE, on there saying, 'We could have done this DATE.' They could have agreed to the additional - they had $MONEY . We brought it up to $MONEY . And when we brought it up to $MONEY , it had MONEY for hospitals and testing in there, which is essential to our opening up. But we also had MONEY for smaller businesses, which are getting left in the shade, and that just was not right. So, it is not a question of bickering. It is about establishing priorities, and we have a differences between our parties. The gentleman that you interviewed, Mr. PERSON, he said on ORG, 'We could have done this DATE, except they had extracurricular stuff.' Extracurricular stuff? CARDINAL for small businesses, more in terms of the EIDL loans, which are flying out the door because they are easier to get for businesses. They have a longer - a long-term and a low interest rate, so they are very appealing. And the grants and aid that never do have to be paid back, in addition to MONEY more for PPP. So, we have to be smart about this. What they rejected DATE, they passed unanimously in the ORG and overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan way, in the ORG. Every bill we have passed has been bipartisan, but we have had to make the case about lower-income, smaller businesses, again, women, minority - we do not want to put any - prioritize anybody over anybody else because it is about jobs. You know it is about jobs. No matter where you work, it is about jobs. So, if that business needs the infusion to keep people on the job, then that is what this is about. But it also has to not ossify any disparity of access to credit in our country, which does exist. So, we want everybody to enjoy the vitality of it all. you had said on DATE that you were disappointed that the banks did not act as better stewards. Banks are going to protect themselves because that is what they have to do, and they asked the government to release them of some of their risk review requirements because, if what the banks did was give loans very quickly to borrowers who they did not know, if those were not good loans, those banks could be on the hook DATE. If the government wanted it done differently, why would not the government do it itself? The ORG, they know how to collect our money. They could give the money out. Well, it was a decision that Secretary of the ORG made to go through the banks for facilitation, that perhaps it would be faster to do than to go through a SBA - a ORG process. In my - I do not want banks to be made villains in this. They are facilitators, and this should be something we go forward with in a very positive way. It is interesting, though, that they make a lot of money off of it and, therefore, it could affect their behavior in all of it. But what I had said is, with the fact the ORG has kissed this loan, there is no risk. And as well as the ORG enabling them to not have this count. If I may, the reason for the delay, if I may, the reason for the delay, the banks need to do a risk review process. After they do that, they then go to the ORG. CARDINAL of the main reasons for the hold-up, banks did not have to do a very long risk review for clients that they already knew. That is one of the reasons it went so quickly. For new borrowers, it took some more time. So they are on the hook before they go to the ORG. These banks lived through this in DATE. They did not make good decisions and they paid for it after. If they did that again, they'd get annihilated. Well, I would say that in DATE, they were part of the problem. I do not see that this time. But let me say that that is why it was hard to understand why our NORP colleagues were not embracing our initiative of MONEY that would go to community development financial institutions. So those institutions who know the neighborhood, who know the community, know the customers, know the businesses, know the culture would be able to make loans, smaller loans, into the community. I thought it was really something that they would welcome because, therefore, those who know that community better would be meeting their needs. Will they get to go before the big banks to make sure the money goes to the small borrowers? And the Secretary has been very - working very hard in my view, when I talked to him about it, he said, 'We are working it, we are working it.' So that these portals, or whatever, are for that community. The $MONEY is already going to the ORG. This is additional and specific to that community. But also, MONEY in EIDL loans, the Emergency Injury Loans, and that is MONEY leveraged to MONEY in loans. No matter how big you are or how small you are, people like the long-term, low interest and the immediacy of getting that. So, that was a very important part of this as well. And then we have the grants that every small business can apply for. But you have said it very clearly. Is it number of employees? Is it length of time? Is it in terms of non-profits, the 501, , ? Let us see how we can expand this. Because we could actually, with the combination of all of these things, be reaching maybe PERCENT of all the small businesses in GPE. And that would be a wonderful thing because, again, the entrepreneurship, the vitality, the courage, the optimism to start a small business. And then people have them for DATE and then you see their hopes just fade because of something so beyond their control. So, make no mistake, this is central. That is why we made it the centerpiece of the first - of the first distribution of funds into the business community. We also had a big program for those aerospace industry, airline industry, which, again, in order to keep people on the job, they received - the Secretary has the discretion to spend a great deal of money there, but we do not want to see any of that money squandered on anything other than job retention because that is what the point of all of this is. And that is how people are going to be able to spend in the economy, have consumer confidence, be able to meet the needs of their families, as we deal with the suffering that is going with this. So, in this next bill, we will be supporting vote by mail in a very important way. We think it is a health issue, at this point. And I did not want to leave this conversation without mentioning the importance of the life, the livelihood - the life of our people, the livelihood of themselves and our economy and the life of our democracy. NORP business needs it. I appreciate all that everyone in our government is doing right now to help us in this trying time. Well, thank you for your objective view of it all because that is all very helpful.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "pelosihousegovnewspressreleasestranscriptofpelosiinterviewonmsnbcslivewithstephanieruhle", "title": "Transcript of Pelosi Interview on MSNBC's Live with Stephanie Ruhle", "source": "https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/transcript-of-pelosi-interview-on-msnbcs-live-with-stephanie-ruhle", "publication_date": "27-04-2020", "crawling_date": "28-06-2023", "politician": ["Nancy Pelosi"], "gender": ["F"]}}
{"id": 7, "text": "We are also continuing to monitor the situations, both in GPE, GPE and in GPE. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims involved in these situations, and we will continue to work with state and local law enforcement officials around both of those incidents. And with that, I will take your questions. ENTITY, let me start by asking you what the President said about potentially meeting with PERSON soon. There is nothing that will put them in the same city at the same time until DATE, at the earliest. So what he is talked about, in terms of soon, would that include either a visit of PERSON to FAC or the President going to GPE? But we want to continue to have a dialogue with GPE, and continue to talk about some of the shared interests we have, whether it is GPE, GPE, and, particularly as the President noted DATE, slowing the tensions when it comes to an arms race, something that is clearly important to both leaders. And now that PERSON has won yet another term as President, is President PERSON concerned that he will continue his aggressive posture toward the rest of the world, and maybe even increase that posture? Look, we are going to continue to maintain the position that we have had, and be tough when necessary. At the same time, we want to continue to have dialogue so that we can work on some of the issues that concern both countries. And we are going to continue to do that, while also continuing to be tough on a number of things, including sanctions on GPE, rebuilding our own military, and exporting energy -- things that we know are not great for GPE. Let me get your reaction to a statement that Senator PERSON, the Chairman of ORG, just put out.  An NORP president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections. And by doing so with PERSON, President PERSON insulted every NORP citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country's future, including the countless NORP patriots who have risked so much to protest and resist PERSON's regime. Look, the President, once again, has maintained that it is important for us to have a dialogue with GPE so that we can focus on some areas of shared interests -- the ones that I have already named. At the same time, we are going to continue to be tough on them. The President joined other countries in these calls. Both GPE and GPE have reached out, as well as President PERSON in DATE. These are conversations that sometimes take place. And, certainly, the President finds there to be an importance in having that dialogue with GPE so that we can talk about some of the big problems that face the world. Does ORG disagree with Senator PERSON's characterization of this as a sham election ? We disagree with the fact that we should not have conversations with GPE. There are important topics that we should be able to discuss. And that is why the President is going to continue to have that dialogue. At the same time, we have been very clear in the actions that we have taken that we are going to be tough on GPE, particularly when it comes to areas that we feel where they have stepped out of place. We have placed tough sanctions on GPE and a number of other things where we have shown exactly what our position is. But since you brought it up in context of PERSON's question about timing -- since you mentioned GPE and GPE, is it the President's intention to meet with PERSON before he sees PERSON or makes a decision on the GPE nuclear deal? Again, we do not have any specific plans laid out at this time. Neither the ORG readout of that phone call with PERSON nor the ORG's readout says anything about election meddling. Did the President not raise the issue of NORP election meddling in that phone call? I do not believe it came on this specific call, but it is something that we have spoken extensively about and continue to look at ways and steps forward to make sure it never happens again. And on the President's new attorney, PERSON, he says that there is this brazen plot by the ORG and the ORG to frame the President. Does ORG share that view? Look, we certainly have said that there have been some concerns with some of the actions that were taken. But in terms of any comments that he is made, I could not speak to those. First, does ORG believe the election in GPE was free and fair? Does ORG believe that the election in GPE was free and fair? Look, in terms of the election there, we are focused on our elections. What we do know is that PERSON has been elected in their country, and that is not something that we can dictate to them how they operate. We can only focus on the freeness and the fairness of our elections, something we PERCENT fully support and something we are going to continue to do everything we can to protect to make sure bad actors do not have the opportunity to impact them in any way. And you said election meddling did not come up in the call. I am curious -- did the recent poisoning in GPE come up in the call? I do not believe that was discussed in DATE's call. Over DATE, on CARDINAL of the DATE TIME shows, PERSON, NORP of GPE, said when responding to the various tweets that the President had put out over DATE regarding Special Counsel PERSON, he said, When you are innocent, act like it. What is your response to what PERSON said over DATE? Look, the President has been very clear about the fact that there was no collusion between his campaign and any other entity. I do not think that any individual, including members of ORG, would like it if they had been accused of taking their seat in ORG by doing something nefarious when they had not , particularly if it went on for DATE into their time in office. My guess is they would be more than anxious to push back, and certainly would defend themselves as the President has clearly done in this situation and has since DATE. Another NORP over DATE, PERSON, also a NORP from GPE, said that, If the President were to fire -- Maybe we need to work on our GPE members. He said that, If the President tries to fire PERSON, it would be the beginning of the end of his presidency. What is your response to what PERSON said? As ORG Counsel, PERSON said DATE, ORG yet again confirms that the President is not considering or discussing the firing of the Special Counsel PERSON. Do you feel like you are losing NORP in -- Do you feel like you are losing NORP in some way? That these CARDINAL prominent NORP from GPE both spoke in this manner over DATE? I certainly do not think we are losing NORP at all. I think we are voicing some frustration over this ongoing process that we look forward to ending soon. In DATE, the President told a room full of reporters that he would love to sit down and do an interview with PERSON under oath and in DATE. At the time, that is what he said. Does he still want to sit down and do an interview with PERSON? Look, we have been fully transparent throughout this process. We have been fully cooperative, and we are going to continue to be cooperative with ORG. Beyond that, I cannot go any further. Can you just provide more clarity on the President's tweets toward PERSON over DATE over DATE, calling him out by name? What was behind that? Like I just said, clearly we have not been shy about the fact that there is frustration of this process. And the President has contended since DATE, and will continue to do so, that there was absolutely no collusion between his campaign and any outside force or country. If you had been attacked mercilessly and continuously, day in, day out, TIME while you are trying to work hard to do good things for this country, and, literally, DATE you wake up to an onslaught of people saying that you are there because of reasons that are completely false, that is frustrating. So why does not he push for the firing? Why does not he push for the firing of PERSON if he thinks the probe should not have begun in the first place, if he thinks the whole thing is a witch hunt? Why does not he push for the firing? But we would like to see this come to a conclusion. I want to follow up on the accusations of fraud in the NORP election. Why does the GPE government not believe that it should criticize GPE for these accusations, which have been brought up by the ORG and GPE government directly in a statement? You know, they are listing things like restrictions on fundamental freedoms and lack of access for opposition candidates. I mean, why does not the President or ORG believe that is something that they should be discussing with the NORP leader? I did not say that we could not discuss it with the NORP leader. I said it did not come up on DATE's call. Again, the focus was to talk about areas of shared interest. We know that we need to continue a dialogue. It is important for a lot of the safety and security of people across the globe. We would like to be able to work with them on things like GPE, on GPE, and also, both countries' shared interest in lowering the tensions when it comes to an arms race, recognizing that that is not the best thing for either country. And so we want to be able to have those conversations. And that was the point of DATE's call. So when is an appropriate time to raise questions about, you know, political freedoms with GPE? Look, we have continued to talk about these important issues, but that is not simply what DATE's call was about. First, we have discussed the President's call to President PERSON following his reelection. Did the President make a similar call to Chancellor PERSON, who has just formed a new government and assumed her fourth mandate in GPE? I know he spoke with the Chancellor, I believe, it was DATE. I'd have to look back at the specific details of their conversation, but I know that they spoke within DATE. The other thing is that Congressman PERSON of GPE is expected, if not DATE, sometime in DATE, to announce he is not running for reelection, making him the 38th NORP ORG member to announce retirement, resignation, or pursuit of another office -- a post-World War II high in the exodus of NORP ORG members. And do members call him when they say they will make announcements like this? Certainly, he is had conversations with a number of members. I cannot speak to this situation specifically and whether or not he is spoken with the President. Right now, we think we have got a great story to tell after DATE of being in office, and we look forward to communicating that to the NORP people and continuing to push the President's agenda. ENTITY, did the topic of religious liberty come up at all with the Crown Prince DATE? Did the President bring that up at all? I do not believe that came up, but I'd have to check on the last CARDINAL of the meeting to be sure, because I was not there. ORG estimates that the NORP-led coalition is responsible in DATE for the deaths of CARDINAL civilians, and took part in CARDINAL unlawful airstrikes. Did the President bring up these concerns about high civilian casualties in his meeting with the Crown Prince DATE? Again, I'd have to check on the last CARDINAL of the meeting because I am not sure, because I was on my way out here. And if I ask you about the call between President PERSON and NORP President PERSON. The NORP said that GPE came up in the call. The readout that was released by ORG did not include any mention of GPE. Did the President discuss the issue of GPE with PERSON? And did he discuss the high civilian casualties as a result of efforts by the PERSON regime and the NORP government on the ground in GPE? And as you know, we have had a number of public statements on our position there, and that certainly has not changed. DATE, the NORP Prime Minister noticed the signs of the pace of ORG talks is accelerating. And he said that the President -- President PERSON -- is enthusiastic about getting a deal. The President is always enthusiastic about making a good deal, but that would be -- the key caveat to any conversation is making sure that whatever deal he makes is good for NORP and NORP workers. And so anything we do, that would have to be a part of that conversation. After that, the entire political process is going to get over the negotiations on ORG. Anything possible be that quick within DATE? I do not have any specific announcement as of this time, but we are continuing to have those negotiations and continuing to have those conversations being led primarily by Ambassador PERSON and working with the President. I will take CARDINAL last questions before the President's event. The President frequently speaks about the need to improve the nation's crumbling infrastructure. Can you explain his opposition to FAC, which is to put a rail tunnel between GPE and his home state of GPE, but has the support of many NORP, and also, according to CARDINAL study, is key to PERCENT of the nation's gross national product? The President specifically wants to address infrastructure on a broader scale, not put all our emphasis into CARDINAL project. We certainly want to see the infrastructure across this country rebuilt, which is why we put forward priorities when it comes to that in a plan moving forward. And we look forward to working with ORG to make some real progress on that in DATE.

And we look forward to working with ORG to make some real progress on that in DATE. And the President has got an event here in TIME.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretarysarahsanders54", "title": "Donald J.

{"id": 8, "text": "Did you get the impression during this discussion in FAC that the President seemed to be more inclined to negotiate with you and Leader PERSON than he did with PERSON and PERSON? I think the President when we went into the meeting, there are CARDINAL of us and CARDINAL of them, the President, the Vice President, NORP Leader, the Speaker, the Majority Leader and Secretary of the ORG participated in those conversations. So, no, I think that they all came in, the Vice President said, 'you know, you put out your number before we had this meeting.' We put out our number after you put out your number, because they had put out the number earlier. No, I think, frankly, as I said, and maybe I will make it clear, when it was clear that we could not go for a longer CR from their standpoint because the ORG needs the resources in a fuller way - a CR, they do not even like a CR, period. They would rather we just pass the bills right now. And hopefully, we will do it soon. But we have issues. You know, we want parity. If you are going to lift caps on ORG, then you are going to lift caps on discretionary domestic investments as well. So it was kind of - it became persuasive when PERSON - the Majority Leader in the ORG said 'I want to do - I am going to put the CR,' and that is really what actually strengthened our hand for DATE. I think maybe that is one of the reasons I decided to share so much with you TIME, because I was reading on TV we went in there, we put it on the table, boom, out the door. No, it was not like that at all. Now, I am an appropriator, so I had a little bit of an advantage, in my view - as I said to the President, left to our own devices, the appropriators, NORP and NORP, can work together to have a compromise on what we should do. It is when the poison pill comes from on high that there is a problem of legislating on an appropriations bill. So we had those kind of, shall we say, clarifications as we went along. And I was very proud of ORG NORP Leader PERSON. He could speak GPE to the President. ENTITY, the President sided with you DATE against his NORP colleagues. TIME you spoke on the phone. You asked him to tweet something. He did it. Are we seeing some kind of renaissance in your relationship, a new era of cooperation? The President - I am hoping and I am praying, and I do not say that as a clich, I am praying that the President really cares about the NORP, or knows that he should care about the DREAMers, and that we are going to pass this bill And we want to do it as soon as possible, to strike while the iron is hot because public opinion is so much in favor. And the churches, the faith-based community, the business community; people who care about GPE are all weighing in on this. But CARDINAL of the - maybe not CARDINAL, but some of the concerns that people have when it came out is - 'you said DATE,' and these people are being fearful that 'pack up because you are out of here in DATE,' not 'we have DATE and we are going to pass a bill, so take comfort.' So that is what I said to him. I said thanks for calling, this is what we need. The people really need a reassurance from you, Mr. President, that DATE is not a period of roundup, but it is just the ORG is frozen and that these people will not be vulnerable. Is that why he called or did he want to discuss other issues? Well, you know, I am not famous for going into details of conversations with Presidents. We did talk about some other issues. But that was because he then put out this. And I was reporting to my colleagues, I said, 'this is what I askedto do,' and boom, boom, boom, the tweet appeared. But you know, again, this is when you are dealing on something that relates to immigration and the past experience, you have to build as much trust as possible because there is so much fear. And we are hoping that they will not be rounding up people, that their only violation of the law in some people's view is status. And this was not even a violation of law that they did, because they came as children. So it is about the children, it is about young people, and we have to pass a bill. And that might mean on whatever vehicle is leaving the station, or maybe we can just do the DREAM Act free and clear. We are collecting - what we are doing right now, we are asking others to do, is collecting co-sponsorships for Congresswoman PERSON's bill, the DREAM Act. As you know, we passed it in the NORP ORG in DATE. It could not get CARDINAL votes in the ORG. But it did get a majority of votes in the ORG. So a majority of people in ORG at that time voted for it. We think we have a stronger hand now. I know we have a lot on the DATE docket here that we are talking about, but another issue that is been kind of in the weeds and we have not talked about much lately is an AUMF. And lay out to the average person why this is such a nettlesome issue when you have both NORP and NORP support, this is not a partisan issue, and why this is so challenging? The authorization of the use of military force, as we call the AUMF, is something that PERSON, our Congresswoman on ORG won, actually, in committee. It disappeared in ORG. I have seen a lot around here, but I have never seen anything disappear. I have seen people remove it or vote it down, but disappear is new. It is thought that the authorization for the use of force that was passed at the time of our initiation of hostilities into GPE was such that it is time for something new. The impression I have from the ORG is they think that what they are doing now is covered by the ORG of DATE, in the fall. As you know, the aspects of an AUMF are about timing. What does this cover? What does it allow you to do? So in terms of reviewing those aspects of for how long and for how wide an area and what the scope of the military involvement would be, it is always - I think it would be really important for us to revisit. Now, it was all predicated on ORG, and then it was justified in terms of ORG being a continuation of ORG. And now geographically, it is in East Africa, you know, it is a broader area than what the original bill was about. So I would hope that we always would revisit something that is what, now DATE, and in a whole different world. But they are saying that they have it. Now, when President PERSON was President and we wanted to have one, Speaker PERSON at the time said we want to see an AUMF proposal from ORG. The AUMF is about our role in the use of force. But nonetheless, the President sent over his proposal. I think that they probably would want to give and then we never acted upon it. But I think that they would probably give President PERSON even more authority than was in the original. So I am not - I think we should revisit it. How is this exacerbated now concerning the President's DATE message about recommitting to GPE? He said - you know - there was a question about what he was doing about GPE. He recommitted, said we are going to put in more troops, he was not going to draw back, and the fact that changes the equation here a little bit and the concern of some with an AUMF. I think it begs the question that we should revisit the AUMF. You called for the idea of the NORP statues in the FAC, at least for the GPE that deal with these statues, to perhaps have them removed. This whole debate, I mean your father dedicated the NORP statues over in GPE, I think, in DATE PERSON, PERSON. I think it was the PERSON statue over in GPE. I am just wondering, is there any concern that now this has been expanded to perhaps maybe rewrite history a bit, maybe a revisionist history? Do you have concerns that there has been - There is concern; you have seen Congresswoman PERSON, I think, is introducing a measure DATE. Senator PERSON said he is going to be introducing legislation. All I was suggesting was when I was Speaker - what I did was, I tried to, shall we say, mix it up in the FAC. We put PERSON, we put PERSON, more women, more minorities, and in significant places. My suggestion was just to the Speaker to review that. I do not know what will happen with any legislation. You have had your hand up for a while. Are you simply optimistic that President PERSON would sign the DREAM Act, or have you been given a direct indication from him that he would do that? Do you want to say it more proactively? I thought I spoke about that a lot. The President, both DATE in the meeting and DATE, made it very clear he wants ORG to act to get this done. Now, just kind of in the back and forth of all of this, what was interesting to me is that the President well, the Attorney General's statement was something that was the equivalent of the worst statue you could ever think of. It was about white people in GPE. It was consistent with what the PERSON folks talk about when they want the purification of GPE. They sort of want to export - they want to deport the CARDINAL people in the country. So in that, shall we say, concern that we have, when the President said DATE and ORG should act, and if they do not I will revisit it, well, if you are saying that the action that President PERSON took was not legal, how are you going to revisit it? It is going to be legal for you but it was not legal for President PERSON, and that is why you have to overturn it now? So I think we all came to a good place. We should remove all doubt. And quite the fact is that we need comprehensive immigration reform. And that would cover a lot more than just the DREAMers. But for right now, we have to strike while the iron is hot, the iron being what President PERSON talked about that I quote all the time, public sentiment is everything. And public sentiment is with the DREAMers. So is this free and independent of any consideration of border enforcement? He said he would sign a standalone bill? I think he probably wants some border enforcement. And we have a responsibility to secure our borders. I have talked to him about, we specifically talked about drugs coming into the country, and the biggest protector of that for us, that has been ORG. They have been the biggest interdictor of drugs coming into our country. But it does not include a wall, no. Following up on PERSON's question, more broadly than DREAMers, is this a new DATE of cooperation you think you have with the President? TIME he tweeted that he is looking forward to working with NORP and NORP. Do you think that you are entering a new era of bipartisanship? I do not know that. What I do know is that the world we live in is a giant kaleidoscope. One day certain factors are in the design. Say this side of the room is opposed to what is happening on this side of the room. DATE it could be the front of the room versus the back of the room. So everybody you work with is a resource to you, or can be. So you want to have your debate and your engagement in a way that always recognizes that this person can be a resource in the next debate. A great woman who served here, PERSON, she would say to me sometimes when I would get, shall we say, exuberant on the floor, 'darling, darling' she always said darling; she was from GPE 'PERSON ,' who was the Whip, 'PERSON used to always say, do not fight every fight as if it is your last fight.' So let us hope that this is a sign of something to come. The CARDINAL thing that is for sure, we will not in terms of what they are proposing on the tax cuts is severely detrimental to everything that we would care about in a budget in a bipartisan way. So we have some clear lines and others where we want to work together on reforming the tax code, simplifying it, make it more fair, making it more - supplying what we need to meet the needs of the NORP people. So we have some things that we know are bigger problems than others, but are always hopeful that we can find common ground, which we have a responsibility to do. If we cannot find it, we stand our ground. I have got a day job, you know? NORP frequently warn of the dangers of uncertainty in the economy, uncertainty if ORG does not act upon the government and there is a threat of a shutdown or does not raise the debt ceiling; there is a threat of a government default. DATE, here the NORP are offering an DATE debt limit extension, which would have offered certainty for DATE. NORP step in and say, no, let us do it for DATE. And just this morning you said you did it solely for the purpose of political leverage in DATE. No, no, I did not say that. I did not say that. I said they said that about us. They said 'you are just doing this for political leverage.' I am saying we need leverage to do what we need to do. But I do not - if your question is 'why do not we just - why do not we just do away with it?' Why do not we just do away with ORG voting to lift the debt ceiling? The Constitution says that the full faith and credit of GPE shall not be questioned, is not in doubt. The PERSON rule that we lived under for a long time, named for a former Leader PERSON, was that it was contained in the budget bill, and when the budget passed, the debt ceiling was lifted. The President even suggested, has anybody ever thought about eliminating this vote? And we said we will take it back to our caucus. We will take it back to our caucus. So I do not see that at all. I thought you said earlier that you had met with the caucus before going to ORG, and that the consensus was that you cannot do anything longer term than the CR because then you lose leverage. And that was the argument that you took to ORG. No, all I said to them is this is what we are going to present. This is what we are going to present. But does a short term debt limit increase not increase the uncertainty in the economy? Now you have to vote on it twice in DATE versus CARDINAL in DATE. In fact, what creates uncertainty is what the NORP did DATE, where they said they were not going to lift the debt ceiling, and that that took our credit rating from ORG to AA, just the suggestion. We said to them, most of our Members have signed a letter to lift the debt ceiling, and we will revisit that when we finish with the appropriations bills and the rest of it. They have not said that. They do not have the votes.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "pelosihousegovnewspressreleasestranscriptofpelosipressconferencetoday131", "title": "Transcript of Pelosi Press Conference Today", "source": "https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/transcript-of-pelosi-press-conference-today-131", "publication_date": "07-09-2017", "crawling_date": "28-06-2023", "politician": ["Nancy Pelosi"], "gender": ["F"]}}
{"id": 9, "text": "I'd be happy to open it up for some questions from the press. Or how will it be enforced here in GPE? And we take it very seriously. This is about the public health of our people. We have ensured that essential services are still available, that if someone needs to go out and get food, that they can do that. And that- If someone needs to go out and get food that they can do that and the food supply chain is robust and prepared to meet the needs of people across the state. We have also ensured that if you need to do banking or gas up your car, you can do some of those fundamental things that are necessary for life. But for any businesses that do not heed this order and they are not essential services, I would anticipate that there will be fines associated with not doing that and they will be shut. We have a moment to stem the crisis that we see unfolding before us and it is going to take all of us to take those actions seriously. With regard to questions about ORG, they are helping with humanitarian efforts, not on any sort of a law enforcement front because we have got to ensure that food gets where it needs to be, that we are setting up temporary hospitals, temporary hospital beds, medical abilities to meet the need. And so they are helping in states across the nation. And it is in that capacity. At this point in time, what we are asking is that people recognize this is an order that they must comply for their own health, for the safety of others and for the longterm health of our economy. We have confidence that when NORP understand how serious this is, if you really have been paying attention or if you are now suddenly starting to pay attention, you know that we all have to do our part and for some of us it'll look simply Doing your part will just look like staying at home. For others and we will be staying at home and going online and making a donation to the food bank. For others perhaps they can call ORG and see if there is something they can do, checking in on elderly friends and neighbors over the phone or FaceTime. I am not suggesting it will be easy, but if we all do our part and that means business owners too, do not play fast and loose with what is essential and what is not. If you are not an essential business, you need to close and you need to protect your employees. We are confident that the vast majority of people are going to do the right thing. We are imploring those who are maybe still uneducated in how serious this is, that perhaps now they will understand because this is an order. And this is going to be something that everyone's got to be a part of following. Restaurants, the carry out, dine out option is still something that is available to people. This is an essential service, which is the feeding of the people of our states. Grocery stores, convenience stores, the pharmacy, the restaurant where you can get your takeout, those will all still continue to serve the public. But we ask the public to, where you can make use of a delivery service, do that, where you do not have to physically be the one to go out and get it. And there are others who are doing that, make use of it if it is available to you. Governor, what is there for people to use to decide whether or not they are covered by this order? I think that as you read the order, and I know you have not had a chance to scrutinize all the language in the order, but I think it is pretty clear about what services are considered essential and whether or not you fall into those parameters are not. I do think that the business community has had an opportunity to give some input over the course of our research and development of this order. And I think that we have made it pretty clear in the terms of the order. This question is for both of you. You have mentioned in your statement, ORG, about thinking of the healthcare workers that are trying to battle this and there seems to be some inconsistency with the guidelines for those healthcare workers between state recommendations and the ORG recommendations as to whether they exposed to a potential case, maybe have been asked by the state to keep working but not to quarantine. My question is, is this the safest move for those workers, but also for patients and families tied to them? I will have to ask ORG to weigh in on that one. We have used, for all of our guidance in the state, we have to look first to the ORG guidelines and we consult with them when we implement our own guidelines. We have to make very difficult choices and make sure that, especially healthcare workers who are symptomatic, are not at work period and that they get the appropriate test if it is warranted and if they test positive that they stay at home. We are actually in alignment with ORG guidelines and we just had to get a little more granular because our clinicians were asking for that guidance. Are they subject to this as well and how do you account for the ones who are trying to make essential equipment, PPE stuff? If you are making essential equipment, you are covered in this order in terms of an essential activity that will continue on. Yes, they are covered by this order. If they are retrofitting to meet critical needs of our nation right now and then the health of our people, then that is an essential service that absolutely would be contemplated and encouraged and permitted under this order.  I mean, PERSON, the fines, we will have to give you some more information on exactly what that looks like. I can tell you that the Director of ORG is the primary when it comes to assessing and writing those. So I think we will have to give you a little more information when we have TIME. Governor, you touched on this, but what changed or occurred or did not occur to make you ramp up the earlier basically advice as opposed to and order with consequences? We know that we are not capable of testing everyone who needs to be tested because we do not have enough tests from the federal government. Despite that, we have seen exponential growth in the number of presumptively positives. We know the trajectory that we are on and I have talked to ENTITY and experts across the country and it became very clear that our healthcare system is quickly going to get overwhelmed and without the support of the ORG and all of the other essential pieces of protection that we need and the resources and the bandwidth for our hospitals. We have to be aggressive in curtailing the community spread. And it is by people and keep away from each other. What we know is that there still are gatherings happening that there still are people that are out and about conducting their lives as though we are not living in the midst of a global epidemic. We do not have beaches that are open right now, but we all saw the footage and I cannot for the life of me figure out why anyone would want to congregate in this era. But the fact of the matter is, we still have people that are doing it and that is why we have got to be really clear about the seriousness of this and put the full weight of an executive order behind it. These are all different pieces of it, but I will tell you the current trajectory we are on, looks a lot like GPE. And if you have seen any of the coverage about what is happening in GPE, what it means for their economy, but most importantly, what it means for the lives of the NORP people, you know that we have got to do everything in our power to keep that from happening here in GPE. And I shared with you CARDINAL anecdote about younger people being as susceptible as older people. There is been this misperception that if you are young you are not susceptible to COVID 19. The fact of the matter is, in GPE, we are seeing severe consequences in our younger people, in ways that they have not seen in other parts of the world. And I have talked to CARDINAL physician who has observed and perhaps there is too little science to know precisely if this is what is going on, but vaping is a lot more popular in GPE than it is elsewhere. And that compromises your respiratory system and makes you more susceptible to respiratory illness. The respiratory illness and so this is a crisis that we are feeling in ways that other parts of the world has not even experienced. Regarding elections, this order goes into DATE, but we are wondering if DATE elections may be impacted by this, if you think they should be postponed? So we are working with the secretary of ORG as well as the legislative leaders to assess if there are ways that we can improve the ability for people to cast their votes at home. I would anticipate that it will take on additional energy DATE. We may have something to share with you later. Are you looking at dorms, things like that to deal with this? And a question on ventilators, I think over DATE, you said that there were CARDINAL across the state. I am wondering how those are being used and what kind of shortage we are facing at the moment? We have teams that are actively looking at just this question of where are we going to need this hospital capacity. Not just in some of the areas where we are seeing the most cases, but we have to come together as a state, understand where our hospital beds are, and where we may have more need. As far as the ventilators, we do need to get a stronger handle on more real time what the situation is on the ground in these intensive care units. But I can tell you at least from anecdotal conversations across the state, we are getting very, very sick people and our intensive care units are getting filled up. Do you have any figures as to how many people are hospitalized with this now? Is that a number that you are tracking?at some point. We are actively trying to track that. Here in the state of GPE, we have a decentralized public health system, so a lot the local health departments actually are able to track that in more real time than we can at the state. But we are actively working to strengthen and centralize data sharing from the hospitals to local health departments and to the state of GPE health department. I do not have the specific number right now. There are CARDINAL of people who are CARDINAL of people who are in intensive care units as we speak. I do not want to misspeak and give you a wrong number, but I know that there are several individuals, CARDINAL who are hospitalized at this point Over DATE, a federal task force was giving briefings and letting you guys know where they stand on things and what their responsibilities are versus state. So I am wondering what your response is to some of those comments that were made over DATE about the responsibilities that state's have to find those resources such as the ventilators and PPE versus the federal government's responsibility. Well, we can litigate what contributed to us all being behind the CARDINAL ball in GPE right now. After we get past the initial crisis that we are confronting, I will just say this, our national stockpile allotment covered CARDINAL shift at a hospital. So where you would ordinarily in a crisis like this, expect a national strategy that covers all of the states and all NORP and makes available the necessary equipment to treat people who are sick, we got enough for CARDINAL shift. It is a source of frustration that I have been clear about and that my frankly colleagues from across the country have as well. We should be able to rely on a national strategy and planning. This is not something that was not known at the federal government level DATE. But re-litigating that and spending energy on it right now does not solve the problem and that is what I am going to stay focused on and that is why my team and the state emergency operation center is working so hard with GPE businesses, with businesses outside of GPE to procure the masks and the face shields and the gowns and all of the different pieces of equipment that are necessary so that we can treat people. That is why the healthcare situation is so dire and that is why taking an aggressive action like stay at home so crucial to our ability to meet the needs of our people and so we are going to continue doing that as people who are listening, who are paying attention, have been reaching in. We are grateful for that. We have been able to do a lot because people have offered to help and where there is additional opportunities like that we are going to avail ourselves of it because at this point in time, I think the governor from GPE said it, it is governor versus governor trying to get as much as they can for our states. If the federal government had done some planning on the front end, we would be in a lot better shape. But here we are and we have all got a job to do for the people that we serve. I will just conclude with this, tough times do not last but tough people do. GPE and this country has been in crises before and we have called on our country men and country women to step up to the challenge to meet the need. And GPE played a huge part in winning World War Two as the arsenal of democracy. Right now we are calling on everyone to do your part. We need to get through this crisis together and we need everyone to do their part. So we are asking, stay home, stay safe, save lives. That is the most important thing that we can all do right now.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptsmichigangovgretchenwhitmercovid19briefingtranscriptapril2ordersk12schoolscloseforrestofyear", "title": "Michigan Gov.

Despite that, we have seen exponential growth in the number of presumptively positives. We know the trajectory that we are on and I have talked to ENTITY and experts across the country and it became very clear that our healthcare system is quickly going to get overwhelmed and without the support of the ORG and all of the other essential pieces of protection that we need and the resources and the bandwidth for our hospitals. We have to be aggressive in curtailing the community spread. And it is by people and keep away from each other. What we know is that there still are gatherings happening that there still are people that are out and about conducting their lives as though we are not living in the midst of a global epidemic. We do not have beaches that are open right now, but we all saw the footage and I cannot for the life of me figure out why anyone would want to congregate in this era. But the fact of the matter is, we still have people that are doing it and that is why we have got to be really clear about the seriousness of this and put the full weight of an executive order behind it. These are all different pieces of it, but I will tell you the current trajectory we are on, looks a lot like GPE. And if you have seen any of the coverage about what is happening in GPE, what it means for their economy, but most importantly, what it means for the lives of the NORP people, you know that we have got to do everything in our power to keep that from happening here in GPE. And I shared with you CARDINAL anecdote about younger people being as susceptible as older people. There is been this misperception that if you are young you are not susceptible to COVID 19. The fact of the matter is, in GPE, we are seeing severe consequences in our younger people, in ways that they have not seen in other parts of the world. And I have talked to CARDINAL physician who has observed and perhaps there is too little science to know precisely if this is what is going on, but vaping is a lot more popular in GPE than it is elsewhere. And that compromises your respiratory system and makes you more susceptible to respiratory illness. The respiratory illness and so this is a crisis that we are feeling in ways that other parts of the world has not even experienced. Regarding elections, this order goes into DATE, but we are wondering if DATE elections may be impacted by this, if you think they should be postponed? So we are working with the secretary of ORG as well as the legislative leaders to assess if there are ways that we can improve the ability for people to cast their votes at home. I would anticipate that it will take on additional energy DATE. We may have something to share with you later. Are you looking at dorms, things like that to deal with this? And a question on ventilators, I think over DATE, you said that there were CARDINAL across the state. I am wondering how those are being used and what kind of shortage we are facing at the moment? We have teams that are actively looking at just this question of where are we going to need this hospital capacity. Not just in some of the areas where we are seeing the most cases, but we have to come together as a state, understand where our hospital beds are, and where we may have more need. As far as the ventilators, we do need to get a stronger handle on more real time what the situation is on the ground in these intensive care units. But I can tell you at least from anecdotal conversations across the state, we are getting very, very sick people and our intensive care units are getting filled up. Do you have any figures as to how many people are hospitalized with this now? Is that a number that you are tracking?at some point. We are actively trying to track that. Here in the state of GPE, we have a decentralized public health system, so a lot the local health departments actually are able to track that in more real time than we can at the state. But we are actively working to strengthen and centralize data sharing from the hospitals to local health departments and to the state of GPE health department. I do not have the specific number right now. There are CARDINAL of people who are CARDINAL of people who are in intensive care units as we speak. I do not want to misspeak and give you a wrong number, but I know that there are several individuals, CARDINAL who are hospitalized at this point Over DATE, a federal task force was giving briefings and letting you guys know where they stand on things and what their responsibilities are versus state. So I am wondering what your response is to some of those comments that were made over DATE about the responsibilities that state's have to find those resources such as the ventilators and PPE versus the federal government's responsibility. Well, we can litigate what contributed to us all being behind the CARDINAL ball in GPE right now. After we get past the initial crisis that we are confronting, I will just say this, our national stockpile allotment covered CARDINAL shift at a hospital. So where you would ordinarily in a crisis like this, expect a national strategy that covers all of the states and all NORP and makes available the necessary equipment to treat people who are sick, we got enough for CARDINAL shift. It is a source of frustration that I have been clear about and that my frankly colleagues from across the country have as well. We should be able to rely on a national strategy and planning. This is not something that was not known at the federal government level DATE. But re-litigating that and spending energy on it right now does not solve the problem and that is what I am going to stay focused on and that is why my team and the state emergency operation center is working so hard with GPE businesses, with businesses outside of GPE to procure the masks and the face shields and the gowns and all of the different pieces of equipment that are necessary so that we can treat people. That is why the healthcare situation is so dire and that is why taking an aggressive action like stay at home so crucial to our ability to meet the needs of our people and so we are going to continue doing that as people who are listening, who are paying attention, have been reaching in. We are grateful for that. We have been able to do a lot because people have offered to help and where there is additional opportunities like that we are going to avail ourselves of it because at this point in time, I think the governor from GPE said it, it is governor versus governor trying to get as much as they can for our states. If the federal government had done some planning on the front end, we would be in a lot better shape. But here we are and we have all got a job to do for the people that we serve. I will just conclude with this, tough times do not last but tough people do. GPE and this country has been in crises before and we have called on our country men and country women to step up to the challenge to meet the need. And GPE played a huge part in winning World War Two as the arsenal of democracy. Right now we are calling on everyone to do your part. We need to get through this crisis together and we need everyone to do their part. So we are asking, stay home, stay safe, save lives. That is the most important thing that we can all do right now.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptsmichigangovgretchenwhitmercovid19briefingtranscriptapril2ordersk12schoolscloseforrestofyear", "title": "Michigan Gov.

{"id": 9, "text": "I'd be happy to open it up for some questions from the press. Or how will it be enforced here in GPE? And we take it very seriously. This is about the public health of our people. We have ensured that essential services are still available, that if someone needs to go out and get food, that they can do that. And that- If someone needs to go out and get food that they can do that and the food supply chain is robust and prepared to meet the needs of people across the state. We have also ensured that if you need to do banking or gas up your car, you can do some of those fundamental things that are necessary for life. But for any businesses that do not heed this order and they are not essential services, I would anticipate that there will be fines associated with not doing that and they will be shut. We have a moment to stem the crisis that we see unfolding before us and it is going to take all of us to take those actions seriously. With regard to questions about ORG, they are helping with humanitarian efforts, not on any sort of a law enforcement front because we have got to ensure that food gets where it needs to be, that we are setting up temporary hospitals, temporary hospital beds, medical abilities to meet the need. And so they are helping in states across the nation. And it is in that capacity. At this point in time, what we are asking is that people recognize this is an order that they must comply for their own health, for the safety of others and for the longterm health of our economy. We have confidence that when NORP understand how serious this is, if you really have been paying attention or if you are now suddenly starting to pay attention, you know that we all have to do our part and for some of us it'll look simply Doing your part will just look like staying at home. For others and we will be staying at home and going online and making a donation to the food bank. For others perhaps they can call ORG and see if there is something they can do, checking in on elderly friends and neighbors over the phone or FaceTime. I am not suggesting it will be easy, but if we all do our part and that means business owners too, do not play fast and loose with what is essential and what is not. If you are not an essential business, you need to close and you need to protect your employees. We are confident that the vast majority of people are going to do the right thing. We are imploring those who are maybe still uneducated in how serious this is, that perhaps now they will understand because this is an order. And this is going to be something that everyone's got to be a part of following. Restaurants, the carry out, dine out option is still something that is available to people. This is an essential service, which is the feeding of the people of our states. Grocery stores, convenience stores, the pharmacy, the restaurant where you can get your takeout, those will all still continue to serve the public. But we ask the public to, where you can make use of a delivery service, do that, where you do not have to physically be the one to go out and get it. And there are others who are doing that, make use of it if it is available to you. Governor, what is there for people to use to decide whether or not they are covered by this order? I think that as you read the order, and I know you have not had a chance to scrutinize all the language in the order, but I think it is pretty clear about what services are considered essential and whether or not you fall into those parameters are not. I do think that the business community has had an opportunity to give some input over the course of our research and development of this order. And I think that we have made it pretty clear in the terms of the order. This question is for both of you. You have mentioned in your statement, ORG, about thinking of the healthcare workers that are trying to battle this and there seems to be some inconsistency with the guidelines for those healthcare workers between state recommendations and the ORG recommendations as to whether they exposed to a potential case, maybe have been asked by the state to keep working but not to quarantine. My question is, is this the safest move for those workers, but also for patients and families tied to them? I will have to ask ORG to weigh in on that one. We have used, for all of our guidance in the state, we have to look first to the ORG guidelines and we consult with them when we implement our own guidelines. We have to make very difficult choices and make sure that, especially healthcare workers who are symptomatic, are not at work period and that they get the appropriate test if it is warranted and if they test positive that they stay at home. We are actually in alignment with ORG guidelines and we just had to get a little more granular because our clinicians were asking for that guidance. Are they subject to this as well and how do you account for the ones who are trying to make essential equipment, PPE stuff? If you are making essential equipment, you are covered in this order in terms of an essential activity that will continue on. Yes, they are covered by this order. If they are retrofitting to meet critical needs of our nation right now and then the health of our people, then that is an essential service that absolutely would be contemplated and encouraged and permitted under this order.  I mean, PERSON, the fines, we will have to give you some more information on exactly what that looks like. I can tell you that the Director of ORG is the primary when it comes to assessing and writing those. So I think we will have to give you a little more information when we have TIME. Governor, you touched on this, but what changed or occurred or did not occur to make you ramp up the earlier basically advice as opposed to and order with consequences? We know that we are not capable of testing everyone who needs to be tested because we do not have enough tests from the federal government. Despite that, we have seen exponential growth in the number of presumptively positives. We know the trajectory that we are on and I have talked to ENTITY and experts across the country and it became very clear that our healthcare system is quickly going to get overwhelmed and without the support of the ORG and all of the other essential pieces of protection that we need and the resources and the bandwidth for our hospitals. We have to be aggressive in curtailing the community spread. And it is by people and keep away from each other. What we know is that there still are gatherings happening that there still are people that are out and about conducting their lives as though we are not living in the midst of a global epidemic. We do not have beaches that are open right now, but we all saw the footage and I cannot for the life of me figure out why anyone would want to congregate in this era. But the fact of the matter is, we still have people that are doing it and that is why we have got to be really clear about the seriousness of this and put the full weight of an executive order behind it. These are all different pieces of it, but I will tell you the current trajectory we are on, looks a lot like GPE.

And that- If someone needs to go out and get food that they can do that and the food supply chain is robust and prepared to meet the needs of people across the state. We have also ensured that if you need to do banking or gas up your car, you can do some of those fundamental things that are necessary for life. But for any businesses that do not heed this order and they are not essential services, I would anticipate that there will be fines associated with not doing that and they will be shut. We have a moment to stem the crisis that we see unfolding before us and it is going to take all of us to take those actions seriously. With regard to questions about ORG, they are helping with humanitarian efforts, not on any sort of a law enforcement front because we have got to ensure that food gets where it needs to be, that we are setting up temporary hospitals, temporary hospital beds, medical abilities to meet the need. And so they are helping in states across the nation. And it is in that capacity. At this point in time, what we are asking is that people recognize this is an order that they must comply for their own health, for the safety of others and for the longterm health of our economy. We have confidence that when NORP understand how serious this is, if you really have been paying attention or if you are now suddenly starting to pay attention, you know that we all have to do our part and for some of us it'll look simply Doing your part will just look like staying at home. For others and we will be staying at home and going online and making a donation to the food bank. For others perhaps they can call ORG and see if there is something they can do, checking in on elderly friends and neighbors over the phone or FaceTime. I am not suggesting it will be easy, but if we all do our part and that means business owners too, do not play fast and loose with what is essential and what is not. If you are not an essential business, you need to close and you need to protect your employees. We are confident that the vast majority of people are going to do the right thing. We are imploring those who are maybe still uneducated in how serious this is, that perhaps now they will understand because this is an order. And this is going to be something that everyone's got to be a part of following. Restaurants, the carry out, dine out option is still something that is available to people. This is an essential service, which is the feeding of the people of our states. Grocery stores, convenience stores, the pharmacy, the restaurant where you can get your takeout, those will all still continue to serve the public. But we ask the public to, where you can make use of a delivery service, do that, where you do not have to physically be the one to go out and get it. And there are others who are doing that, make use of it if it is available to you. Governor, what is there for people to use to decide whether or not they are covered by this order? I think that as you read the order, and I know you have not had a chance to scrutinize all the language in the order, but I think it is pretty clear about what services are considered essential and whether or not you fall into those parameters are not. I do think that the business community has had an opportunity to give some input over the course of our research and development of this order. And I think that we have made it pretty clear in the terms of the order. This question is for both of you. You have mentioned in your statement, ORG, about thinking of the healthcare workers that are trying to battle this and there seems to be some inconsistency with the guidelines for those healthcare workers between state recommendations and the ORG recommendations as to whether they exposed to a potential case, maybe have been asked by the state to keep working but not to quarantine. My question is, is this the safest move for those workers, but also for patients and families tied to them? I will have to ask ORG to weigh in on that one. We have used, for all of our guidance in the state, we have to look first to the ORG guidelines and we consult with them when we implement our own guidelines. We have to make very difficult choices and make sure that, especially healthcare workers who are symptomatic, are not at work period and that they get the appropriate test if it is warranted and if they test positive that they stay at home. We are actually in alignment with ORG guidelines and we just had to get a little more granular because our clinicians were asking for that guidance. Are they subject to this as well and how do you account for the ones who are trying to make essential equipment, PPE stuff? If you are making essential equipment, you are covered in this order in terms of an essential activity that will continue on. Yes, they are covered by this order. If they are retrofitting to meet critical needs of our nation right now and then the health of our people, then that is an essential service that absolutely would be contemplated and encouraged and permitted under this order.  I mean, PERSON, the fines, we will have to give you some more information on exactly what that looks like. I can tell you that the Director of ORG is the primary when it comes to assessing and writing those. So I think we will have to give you a little more information when we have TIME. Governor, you touched on this, but what changed or occurred or did not occur to make you ramp up the earlier basically advice as opposed to and order with consequences? We know that we are not capable of testing everyone who needs to be tested because we do not have enough tests from the federal government. Despite that, we have seen exponential growth in the number of presumptively positives. We know the trajectory that we are on and I have talked to ENTITY and experts across the country and it became very clear that our healthcare system is quickly going to get overwhelmed and without the support of the ORG and all of the other essential pieces of protection that we need and the resources and the bandwidth for our hospitals. We have to be aggressive in curtailing the community spread. And it is by people and keep away from each other. What we know is that there still are gatherings happening that there still are people that are out and about conducting their lives as though we are not living in the midst of a global epidemic. We do not have beaches that are open right now, but we all saw the footage and I cannot for the life of me figure out why anyone would want to congregate in this era. But the fact of the matter is, we still have people that are doing it and that is why we have got to be really clear about the seriousness of this and put the full weight of an executive order behind it. These are all different pieces of it, but I will tell you the current trajectory we are on, looks a lot like GPE. And if you have seen any of the coverage about what is happening in GPE, what it means for their economy, but most importantly, what it means for the lives of the NORP people, you know that we have got to do everything in our power to keep that from happening here in GPE. And I shared with you CARDINAL anecdote about younger people being as susceptible as older people. There is been this misperception that if you are young you are not susceptible to COVID 19. The fact of the matter is, in GPE, we are seeing severe consequences in our younger people, in ways that they have not seen in other parts of the world. And I have talked to CARDINAL physician who has observed and perhaps there is too little science to know precisely if this is what is going on, but vaping is a lot more popular in GPE than it is elsewhere. And that compromises your respiratory system and makes you more susceptible to respiratory illness. The respiratory illness and so this is a crisis that we are feeling in ways that other parts of the world has not even experienced. Regarding elections, this order goes into DATE, but we are wondering if DATE elections may be impacted by this, if you think they should be postponed? So we are working with the secretary of ORG as well as the legislative leaders to assess if there are ways that we can improve the ability for people to cast their votes at home. I would anticipate that it will take on additional energy DATE. We may have something to share with you later. Are you looking at dorms, things like that to deal with this? And a question on ventilators, I think over DATE, you said that there were CARDINAL across the state. I am wondering how those are being used and what kind of shortage we are facing at the moment? We have teams that are actively looking at just this question of where are we going to need this hospital capacity. Not just in some of the areas where we are seeing the most cases, but we have to come together as a state, understand where our hospital beds are, and where we may have more need. As far as the ventilators, we do need to get a stronger handle on more real time what the situation is on the ground in these intensive care units. But I can tell you at least from anecdotal conversations across the state, we are getting very, very sick people and our intensive care units are getting filled up. Do you have any figures as to how many people are hospitalized with this now? Is that a number that you are tracking?at some point. We are actively trying to track that. Here in the state of GPE, we have a decentralized public health system, so a lot the local health departments actually are able to track that in more real time than we can at the state. But we are actively working to strengthen and centralize data sharing from the hospitals to local health departments and to the state of GPE health department. I do not have the specific number right now. There are CARDINAL of people who are CARDINAL of people who are in intensive care units as we speak. I do not want to misspeak and give you a wrong number, but I know that there are several individuals, CARDINAL who are hospitalized at this point Over DATE, a federal task force was giving briefings and letting you guys know where they stand on things and what their responsibilities are versus state. So I am wondering what your response is to some of those comments that were made over DATE about the responsibilities that state's have to find those resources such as the ventilators and PPE versus the federal government's responsibility. Well, we can litigate what contributed to us all being behind the CARDINAL ball in GPE right now. After we get past the initial crisis that we are confronting, I will just say this, our national stockpile allotment covered CARDINAL shift at a hospital. So where you would ordinarily in a crisis like this, expect a national strategy that covers all of the states and all NORP and makes available the necessary equipment to treat people who are sick, we got enough for CARDINAL shift. It is a source of frustration that I have been clear about and that my frankly colleagues from across the country have as well. We should be able to rely on a national strategy and planning. This is not something that was not known at the federal government level DATE. But re-litigating that and spending energy on it right now does not solve the problem and that is what I am going to stay focused on and that is why my team and the state emergency operation center is working so hard with GPE businesses, with businesses outside of GPE to procure the masks and the face shields and the gowns and all of the different pieces of equipment that are necessary so that we can treat people. That is why the healthcare situation is so dire and that is why taking an aggressive action like stay at home so crucial to our ability to meet the needs of our people and so we are going to continue doing that as people who are listening, who are paying attention, have been reaching in. We are grateful for that. We have been able to do a lot because people have offered to help and where there is additional opportunities like that we are going to avail ourselves of it because at this point in time, I think the governor from GPE said it, it is governor versus governor trying to get as much as they can for our states. If the federal government had done some planning on the front end, we would be in a lot better shape. But here we are and we have all got a job to do for the people that we serve. I will just conclude with this, tough times do not last but tough people do. GPE and this country has been in crises before and we have called on our country men and country women to step up to the challenge to meet the need. And GPE played a huge part in winning World War Two as the arsenal of democracy. Right now we are calling on everyone to do your part. We need to get through this crisis together and we need everyone to do their part. So we are asking, stay home, stay safe, save lives. That is the most important thing that we can all do right now.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptsmichigangovgretchenwhitmercovid19briefingtranscriptapril2ordersk12schoolscloseforrestofyear", "title": "Michigan Gov.

{"id": 10, "text": "Is that an accurate way of saying your name? ENTITY, will GPE be invited to participate in ORG at ORG summit? And how much, if it gets it, this invitation, how much time will be needed for GPE to enter ORG? DATE as it is for GPE, or DATE as it was for GPE? ENTITY, first of all, it is -the decision will be made by ORG members at GPE. So when I come to your country, I will be saying that I believe that GPE benefits from not only the process to join ORG but eventually, hopefully, joining ORG. But that decision will not be made until we are all there in GPE. Secondly, it just depends on the country as to how long events will-the reforms take in order to get offered membership into ORG. And I believe it is in our collective interest that we offer a clear path forward. But it is very important for the people in your country to understand that the decision will not be made until after I leave GPE and make it to GPE. Are they still talking about the rainbow speech ? Were you there for that? I was giving a speech in the town square where PERSON had given his final speech. You remember that? I remember the rainbow most of all. GPE is a country between ORG member GPE and possible future ORG member GPE. poverty, corruption, and NORP troops on its territory without its consent. GPE is currently involved in resolving a breakaway region, GPE. But my question is, what do you think GPE can do to help GPE to become a democratic, independent state and not a failed state under NORP influence, a point of instability at the ORG border? First is to continue to make our intentions clear, and that is that we want to work to make sure GPE, which is now an independent nation, has got sovereign borders and is treated like an independent nation. Secondly, we constantly advocate for good, clean, open government. Thirdly, we are a member of ORG which is the process by which, hopefully, the GPE issue would be solved. So our strategy is to work with the relevant parties and to promote, as you said, a independent, open, transparent, good-government GPE. how do you see GPE future in the ORG architecture in southeastern Europe, regarding its capability to host joint military bases, and primarily ORG forces, and the further development of its armed forces and its readiness to take part in ORG missions and contribute to the common security of the alliance? And how do you see the role of GPE in promoting peace and stability in southeastern Europe, especially regarding the present situation relating to the establishment of independent GPE? Secondly, GPE has served as a very good example, following a very dramatic moment, and that is the breakup of GPE. And your Government has made difficult decisions and made those decisions, first and foremost, on behalf of the people. But it turns out, many of the reform decisions, therefore, make it likely that GPE will be invited into ORG. The question is, would people have predicted DATE that we'd be having this kind of discussion about GPE? And yet GPE is a independent, sovereign nation, hopefully, soon to be invited to join ORG, which is a clear example of what is possible if people make the right decisions on behalf of their people. Part of being a part of ORG means commitment to a modern military. And NORP troops, which have performed bravely in recent active theaters during this war against extremism, will benefit from being in ORG and benefit from serving side by side with other members of ORG. ORG membership would be a very positive thing for the people of GPE. And I am really looking forward to going to your country. I hope I am coming with good news, but the decision will be made in this case before I go to GPE. And they say it is one of the most beautiful coastlines in the entire world. Hope you are going to see that. Am I going to get to see the coastline? I do think GPE ought to be in ORG, yes. In a different field of operations, in GPE, there is been a recent upsurge again in violence, which appears to have emanated in the area of GPE, which GPE used to control. Do you believe recent events there serve as a warning to those in your country and beyond who have counseled you to withdraw rapidly? My first reaction to watching ORG respond forcefully-and to make it abundantly clear that-I think the exact-I cannot remember the exact words of the Prime Minister, but criminal elements, I know, were a part of his declaration-would be dealt with. I thought that was a very positive moment in the development of a sovereign nation that is willing to take on elements that are-you know, that believe they are beyond the law. And secondly, we are helping, but it is important to know that the NORP are in the lead. This is a positive moment in the development of a nation that can govern itself and defend itself and sustain itself. We will provide oversight and, on occasion, support when asked. And CARDINAL of the things I will be saying in the runup to the PERSON-Crocker testimony is that we have made substantial gains, but it is still a fragile situation. Therefore, the decision about our troop levels will be based upon not politics or not who can scream the loudest, but based upon whether or not we can maintain the successes we have had. And I understand there is people here who want us to leave regardless of the situation, but that is not going to happen so long as I am the Commander in Chief. The NORP commitment was-first of all, you were there from DATE, and you were there during the very heavy fighting. And the NORP commitment was to move to the airbase based upon success. And I am very grateful for the NORP friendship and alliance and the contributions. What do you think, ENTITY? So you flew all the way over here just for this interview? Oh, so guess what happened to me. I went down to GPE-that is in GPE-and I went to an event for-to honor some of our soldiers' families. And a local doctor-I think it was a doctor-came and said, Would you mind meeting a group of people from GPE? And there we were in GPE, GPE, with, I think, maybe CARDINAL health care specialists from GPE that were in my home GPE. And it was sure good to meet them. And how important is GPE's recognition of GPE in the GPE point of view? Do you expect this step from the NORP authorities in the nearest future? That is going to be up to the NORP authorities to make the decisions that they deem are necessary. We hope they will recognize GPE's independence, just like we have. It is supervised independence, of course, but we strongly supported that idea from the beginning and supported the ORG plan that would help lead to a supervised independence and, at the same time, guarantee the minority rights within GPE. And we would hope GPE would do the same thing. GPE is a GPE ally in GPE and GPE, but the NORP are not met as allies on the GPE territory. You are heading towards the visa issue, are not you? What GPE should do to enter in waiver visa program? And what do you recommend us, bilateral negotiations with GPE or negotiations through ORG? You better turn that thing up, because I am going to give you a whopper of an answer. Give me the news, I hope. Now, first of all, it is hard for me to justify to the citizens of GPE that they can serve alongside our troops in major theaters in the war against extremists and not be able to have-be treated like other members of the ORG, as far as visa waiver, and I know that. And it is difficult for citizens to understand that. But we are still dealing with a-you know, it is-we are adjusting law based upon previous practice. And the law needed to change, reflecting DATE, and it did change. ORG did change the capacity for-to have a new look at visa waiver. And my advice is for ORG to negotiate bilaterally with GPE in order to solve this problem. There are other countries in your neighborhood that are making good progress toward being granted visa waiver. And I would strongly urge your leaders to take a look at what they have done and then interface with our officials. And I will , of course, be talking of this with the President and the Prime Minister when I am there. ENTITY, NORP ORG membership bid and steadfast support of your administration for that ambition was a centerpiece of the bilateral relations between GPE and GPE last DATE. And will it now, if GPE became a ORG member-and relations will be elevated to the higher level of allies-can we expect to see more importance will be attached to the economic cooperation, GPE investment in GPE in the future? Yes, our relationships tend not to be-they tend to be multidimensional and not just based upon CARDINAL aspect or another. And I believe strongly in free trade and the movement of investment. And GPE occupies a crucial part-a crucial space in an important part of the world. And of course, we want to enhance trade. A lot of NORP need to learn more about GPE, although there are CARDINAL NORP here. Of course, those opportunities will be advantaged if the Government makes rational decisions on, for example, good investment laws. And therefore, the laws need to be transparent, the rule of law consistent, the Government obviously clean, so that the main risk for an invested currency is not government risk, it is the risk of the enterprise itself. And therefore, to answer your question, yes, of course, we want to have all kinds of different aspects of our relationship flourish with GPE. But in terms of investing, it is going to be up to the Government to make decisions to make sure the investment climate is good. You mentioned in your preamble that it is important for ORG to honor its obligations to GPE. In DATE, PERSON, your new friend- -has promised another CARDINAL troops for GPE. Is there any sense that on that battlefield and indeed, beyond, GPE is now emerging as your greatest ally? I have always said that the relationship with GPE is a special relationship. And that relationship was never as special as it was during times of conflict, whether it be the relationship in the past between, like, PERSON and PERSON, or whether it be the current relationship, more modern relationship between PERSON and myself. And so your question, our greatest ally, it is going to be hard for any nation to trump GPE as our-GPE as our greatest ally. Having said that, no question, the relationship is changing for the better, and President PERSON gets a lot of credit for that. I like him personally. He is a highly energetic, decisive person, who is not interested in creating divisions between-in the transatlantic alliance, but is interested in making sure that not only are bilateral relations are good, but the transatlantic alliance meets the threats. And his statement about commitment to-NORP troops to GPE is a very important preamble to the ORG conference. When you combine our commitment, the NORP commitment, the NORP commitment, and the NORP commitment of troops that will be in harm's way, it is a strong statement that ORG understands the threats, understands the challenges, and is willing to rise to them. I thought we said CARDINAL questions apiece. In your opinion, what are the prospects for democracy in GPE, in PERSON I have not met President PERSON yet. I may have met him once, but I have not had a talk to him, President to President, obviously. I am looking forward to meeting him. So I am going to go to GPE. I have been invited to GPE. President PERSON has invited me to GPE. You are the first to hear it, so you can hustle out of here and put it on the wires. This is no longer off the record. TIME, President PERSON has invited me to go to GPE. And it is to discuss the strategic agreement, the crucial part of which is missile defense. PERSON and PERSON had a good visit with the President and counterparts on this very issue-and hopefully, that we can advance our dialogue, so at some point in time, we can reach an agreement on these important matters, proliferation matters. I know we have got agreement on GPE, and that is that GPE should not have the capacity to enrich, and that I supported the NORP efforts to convince the NORP that they did not need to learn how to enrich, because he-PERSON-was willing to provide enriched uranium for a civilian nuclear power plant. So there is an area where we will continue to have discussions. And I called President-elect PERSON and reminded him-and congratulated him for getting elected and reminded him that-of some of the comments he made about rule law and transparency-and cannot remember exactly everything he said, but it sounded very progressive. And I said, we are listening very carefully to your words, and I appreciated your speech and looking forward to working with you to help accomplish those objectives. But I have yet to work with him, obviously, President to President. So check back in with me after I have had a couple of meetings with him. When are you going to GPE? We have not worked the details yet. In other words, there is an invitation out there, and this is really-the way to look at this is a follow-up to PERSON and PERSON's meeting, which is good. GPE and other nations would hope that GPE would have good relations with GPE. And it is important that we have good relations with GPE; we can find common interests. On the other hand, there are areas where we have been able to be in a position where I have expressed my disagreements with President PERSON on different matters related to their democracy. And my strategy all along is to keep relations such that he will actually listen to what I have to say. So when you hear people say, PERSON has got good relations with PERSON, there is a reason why. Because if you are -in order to have somebody listen to you, they got to at least have an open mind. And it is hard to have an open mind if the only thing you are doing is try to blast away on a regular basis about your disagreements publicly. I have chosen not to do that. Therefore, I am optimistic we can reach accord on very important matters. I think a lot of people in Europe would have a deep sigh of relief if we are able to reach an accord on missile defense. CARDINAL of the things that, hopefully, is clear to the NORP side is that this system is not aimed at GPE. After all, it does not take many missiles to overwhelm the kind of system we are talking about. And GPE has got plenty of missiles if they want to overwhelm. This is really aimed at a potential missile launch, for example, out of the Middle East. And therefore, I think it makes sense for us to be able to be in a position, if people so choose to share information and fully understand the operational activities of a system, so as to build confidence. I am looking forward to it. Do you think President PERSON continues to pull the strings? It is what we do for a living.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists6", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-journalists-6", "publication_date": "26-03-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

It is supervised independence, of course, but we strongly supported that idea from the beginning and supported the ORG plan that would help lead to a supervised independence and, at the same time, guarantee the minority rights within GPE. And we would hope GPE would do the same thing. GPE is a GPE ally in GPE and GPE, but the NORP are not met as allies on the GPE territory. You are heading towards the visa issue, are not you? What GPE should do to enter in waiver visa program? And what do you recommend us, bilateral negotiations with GPE or negotiations through ORG? You better turn that thing up, because I am going to give you a whopper of an answer. Give me the news, I hope. Now, first of all, it is hard for me to justify to the citizens of GPE that they can serve alongside our troops in major theaters in the war against extremists and not be able to have-be treated like other members of the ORG, as far as visa waiver, and I know that. And it is difficult for citizens to understand that. But we are still dealing with a-you know, it is-we are adjusting law based upon previous practice. And the law needed to change, reflecting DATE, and it did change. ORG did change the capacity for-to have a new look at visa waiver. And my advice is for ORG to negotiate bilaterally with GPE in order to solve this problem. There are other countries in your neighborhood that are making good progress toward being granted visa waiver. And I would strongly urge your leaders to take a look at what they have done and then interface with our officials. And I will , of course, be talking of this with the President and the Prime Minister when I am there. ENTITY, NORP ORG membership bid and steadfast support of your administration for that ambition was a centerpiece of the bilateral relations between GPE and GPE last DATE. And will it now, if GPE became a ORG member-and relations will be elevated to the higher level of allies-can we expect to see more importance will be attached to the economic cooperation, GPE investment in GPE in the future? Yes, our relationships tend not to be-they tend to be multidimensional and not just based upon CARDINAL aspect or another. And I believe strongly in free trade and the movement of investment. And GPE occupies a crucial part-a crucial space in an important part of the world. And of course, we want to enhance trade. A lot of NORP need to learn more about GPE, although there are CARDINAL NORP here. Of course, those opportunities will be advantaged if the Government makes rational decisions on, for example, good investment laws. And therefore, the laws need to be transparent, the rule of law consistent, the Government obviously clean, so that the main risk for an invested currency is not government risk, it is the risk of the enterprise itself. And therefore, to answer your question, yes, of course, we want to have all kinds of different aspects of our relationship flourish with GPE. But in terms of investing, it is going to be up to the Government to make decisions to make sure the investment climate is good. You mentioned in your preamble that it is important for ORG to honor its obligations to GPE. In DATE, PERSON, your new friend- -has promised another CARDINAL troops for GPE. Is there any sense that on that battlefield and indeed, beyond, GPE is now emerging as your greatest ally? I have always said that the relationship with GPE is a special relationship. And that relationship was never as special as it was during times of conflict, whether it be the relationship in the past between, like, PERSON and PERSON, or whether it be the current relationship, more modern relationship between PERSON and myself. And so your question, our greatest ally, it is going to be hard for any nation to trump GPE as our-GPE as our greatest ally. Having said that, no question, the relationship is changing for the better, and President PERSON gets a lot of credit for that. I like him personally. He is a highly energetic, decisive person, who is not interested in creating divisions between-in the transatlantic alliance, but is interested in making sure that not only are bilateral relations are good, but the transatlantic alliance meets the threats. And his statement about commitment to-NORP troops to GPE is a very important preamble to the ORG conference. When you combine our commitment, the NORP commitment, the NORP commitment, and the NORP commitment of troops that will be in harm's way, it is a strong statement that ORG understands the threats, understands the challenges, and is willing to rise to them. I thought we said CARDINAL questions apiece. In your opinion, what are the prospects for democracy in GPE, in PERSON I have not met President PERSON yet. I may have met him once, but I have not had a talk to him, President to President, obviously. I am looking forward to meeting him. So I am going to go to GPE. I have been invited to GPE. President PERSON has invited me to GPE. You are the first to hear it, so you can hustle out of here and put it on the wires. This is no longer off the record. TIME, President PERSON has invited me to go to GPE. And it is to discuss the strategic agreement, the crucial part of which is missile defense. PERSON and PERSON had a good visit with the President and counterparts on this very issue-and hopefully, that we can advance our dialogue, so at some point in time, we can reach an agreement on these important matters, proliferation matters. I know we have got agreement on GPE, and that is that GPE should not have the capacity to enrich, and that I supported the NORP efforts to convince the NORP that they did not need to learn how to enrich, because he-PERSON-was willing to provide enriched uranium for a civilian nuclear power plant. So there is an area where we will continue to have discussions. And I called President-elect PERSON and reminded him-and congratulated him for getting elected and reminded him that-of some of the comments he made about rule law and transparency-and cannot remember exactly everything he said, but it sounded very progressive. And I said, we are listening very carefully to your words, and I appreciated your speech and looking forward to working with you to help accomplish those objectives. But I have yet to work with him, obviously, President to President. So check back in with me after I have had a couple of meetings with him. When are you going to GPE? We have not worked the details yet. In other words, there is an invitation out there, and this is really-the way to look at this is a follow-up to PERSON and PERSON's meeting, which is good. GPE and other nations would hope that GPE would have good relations with GPE. And it is important that we have good relations with GPE; we can find common interests. On the other hand, there are areas where we have been able to be in a position where I have expressed my disagreements with President PERSON on different matters related to their democracy. And my strategy all along is to keep relations such that he will actually listen to what I have to say. So when you hear people say, PERSON has got good relations with PERSON, there is a reason why. Because if you are -in order to have somebody listen to you, they got to at least have an open mind. And it is hard to have an open mind if the only thing you are doing is try to blast away on a regular basis about your disagreements publicly. I have chosen not to do that. Therefore, I am optimistic we can reach accord on very important matters. I think a lot of people in Europe would have a deep sigh of relief if we are able to reach an accord on missile defense. CARDINAL of the things that, hopefully, is clear to the NORP side is that this system is not aimed at GPE. After all, it does not take many missiles to overwhelm the kind of system we are talking about. And GPE has got plenty of missiles if they want to overwhelm. This is really aimed at a potential missile launch, for example, out of the Middle East. And therefore, I think it makes sense for us to be able to be in a position, if people so choose to share information and fully understand the operational activities of a system, so as to build confidence. I am looking forward to it. Do you think President PERSON continues to pull the strings? It is what we do for a living.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists6", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-journalists-6", "publication_date": "26-03-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 10, "text": "Is that an accurate way of saying your name? ENTITY, will GPE be invited to participate in ORG at ORG summit? And how much, if it gets it, this invitation, how much time will be needed for GPE to enter ORG? DATE as it is for GPE, or DATE as it was for GPE? ENTITY, first of all, it is -the decision will be made by ORG members at GPE. So when I come to your country, I will be saying that I believe that GPE benefits from not only the process to join ORG but eventually, hopefully, joining ORG. But that decision will not be made until we are all there in GPE. Secondly, it just depends on the country as to how long events will-the reforms take in order to get offered membership into ORG. And I believe it is in our collective interest that we offer a clear path forward. But it is very important for the people in your country to understand that the decision will not be made until after I leave GPE and make it to GPE. Are they still talking about the rainbow speech ? Were you there for that? I was giving a speech in the town square where PERSON had given his final speech. You remember that? I remember the rainbow most of all. GPE is a country between ORG member GPE and possible future ORG member GPE. poverty, corruption, and NORP troops on its territory without its consent. GPE is currently involved in resolving a breakaway region, GPE. But my question is, what do you think GPE can do to help GPE to become a democratic, independent state and not a failed state under NORP influence, a point of instability at the ORG border? First is to continue to make our intentions clear, and that is that we want to work to make sure GPE, which is now an independent nation, has got sovereign borders and is treated like an independent nation. Secondly, we constantly advocate for good, clean, open government. Thirdly, we are a member of ORG which is the process by which, hopefully, the GPE issue would be solved. So our strategy is to work with the relevant parties and to promote, as you said, a independent, open, transparent, good-government GPE. how do you see GPE future in the ORG architecture in southeastern Europe, regarding its capability to host joint military bases, and primarily ORG forces, and the further development of its armed forces and its readiness to take part in ORG missions and contribute to the common security of the alliance? And how do you see the role of GPE in promoting peace and stability in southeastern Europe, especially regarding the present situation relating to the establishment of independent GPE? Secondly, GPE has served as a very good example, following a very dramatic moment, and that is the breakup of GPE. And your Government has made difficult decisions and made those decisions, first and foremost, on behalf of the people. But it turns out, many of the reform decisions, therefore, make it likely that GPE will be invited into ORG. The question is, would people have predicted DATE that we'd be having this kind of discussion about GPE? And yet GPE is a independent, sovereign nation, hopefully, soon to be invited to join ORG, which is a clear example of what is possible if people make the right decisions on behalf of their people. Part of being a part of ORG means commitment to a modern military. And NORP troops, which have performed bravely in recent active theaters during this war against extremism, will benefit from being in ORG and benefit from serving side by side with other members of ORG. ORG membership would be a very positive thing for the people of GPE. And I am really looking forward to going to your country. I hope I am coming with good news, but the decision will be made in this case before I go to GPE. And they say it is one of the most beautiful coastlines in the entire world. Hope you are going to see that. Am I going to get to see the coastline? I do think GPE ought to be in ORG, yes. In a different field of operations, in GPE, there is been a recent upsurge again in violence, which appears to have emanated in the area of GPE, which GPE used to control. Do you believe recent events there serve as a warning to those in your country and beyond who have counseled you to withdraw rapidly? My first reaction to watching ORG respond forcefully-and to make it abundantly clear that-I think the exact-I cannot remember the exact words of the Prime Minister, but criminal elements, I know, were a part of his declaration-would be dealt with. I thought that was a very positive moment in the development of a sovereign nation that is willing to take on elements that are-you know, that believe they are beyond the law. And secondly, we are helping, but it is important to know that the NORP are in the lead. This is a positive moment in the development of a nation that can govern itself and defend itself and sustain itself. We will provide oversight and, on occasion, support when asked. And CARDINAL of the things I will be saying in the runup to the PERSON-Crocker testimony is that we have made substantial gains, but it is still a fragile situation. Therefore, the decision about our troop levels will be based upon not politics or not who can scream the loudest, but based upon whether or not we can maintain the successes we have had. And I understand there is people here who want us to leave regardless of the situation, but that is not going to happen so long as I am the Commander in Chief. The NORP commitment was-first of all, you were there from DATE, and you were there during the very heavy fighting. And the NORP commitment was to move to the airbase based upon success. And I am very grateful for the NORP friendship and alliance and the contributions. What do you think, ENTITY? So you flew all the way over here just for this interview? Oh, so guess what happened to me. I went down to GPE-that is in GPE-and I went to an event for-to honor some of our soldiers' families. And a local doctor-I think it was a doctor-came and said, Would you mind meeting a group of people from GPE? And there we were in GPE, GPE, with, I think, maybe CARDINAL health care specialists from GPE that were in my home GPE. And it was sure good to meet them. And how important is GPE's recognition of GPE in the GPE point of view? Do you expect this step from the NORP authorities in the nearest future? That is going to be up to the NORP authorities to make the decisions that they deem are necessary. We hope they will recognize GPE's independence, just like we have. It is supervised independence, of course, but we strongly supported that idea from the beginning and supported the ORG plan that would help lead to a supervised independence and, at the same time, guarantee the minority rights within GPE.

{"id": 11, "text": "First, I am really looking forward to the trip. It is a chance for me to see old friends, make new friends, and talk about an agenda that is based upon freedom and the obligation, for those of us who benefit from our free societies, to help less fortunate people. Obviously, the ORG is going to be the center point of the visit; it will be where the most focus is. But I take my bilateral visits very seriously. We are starting in GPE. I am looking forward to seeing the President and the Prime Minister. Besides my bilateral meetings with the leadership, I am looking forward to my democracy speech. PERSON has asked me to come and speak to a democracy forum. I feel very strongly that GPE must take the lead in promoting democracy around the world-even in places where it may not look like it could-that it is very hospitable because I believe, ultimately, it is hospitable. And so it is going to be an important speech, and I am working on it. And then, of course, I go to GPE for ORG I have been in that beautiful part of your country before. I am looking forward to the seaside resort. Of course, I am anxious to see the Chancellor. She and I have got a very strong relationship. I do not know if you know this or not, but we do visit via secure video on a fairly regular basis. I have had some-you know, a lot of meaningful conversations with her, other than by phone. And DATE I will be talking about the need for all of us to work together to deal with HIV/AIDS and malaria and education. And, of course, global climate change will be an issue as well. And then we will go on to GPE. I am looking forward to going back-for my third time; twice in GPE, third time in GPE. Of course, part of the discussions with both countries will be on missile defense. I will be glad to answer any questions you have on that. It is just an important issue for us to discuss, and it is an important for me to allay people's fears. My friend PERSON is making this to be a case where somehow this is going to jeopardize relations in Europe, and it is going to make the world a more dangerous place-quite the opposite. The reason one advocates and works for a missile defense system is to protect free peoples from the launch of a missile from a hostile regime. We do not agree with GPE all the time, but nevertheless, I view them as a friendly nation, not a hostile nation. And I will work with PERSON not only at ORG but when he comes to visit up east here. But I know that is going to be part of our conversation. By the way, in the case of GPE, GPE, GPE, and, to a certain extent, GPE, and definitely GPE, there is a lot of obviously, you know, NORP who are very interested in this trip. NORP are-there is a lot of them, and they really love their country of origin, their grandfathers' country of origin. And this is an important trip symbolically, as well, to see their NORP President in GPE-or in GPE, a lot of NORP are very proud of their heritage as well. So the trip obviously is the chance to visit on important issues, whether it be GPE or GPE, where these countries are supportive, as well as their common interests in bilateral issues. I am looking forward to CARDINAL things in GPE, obviously seeing His Holy Father. Sometimes I am not poetic enough to describe what it is like to be in the presence of the Holy Father. And I have not been in the presence of this particular Holy Father. Obviously, CARDINAL visits with the last great man, and I am looking forward to this. I am looking forward to hearing him. I will be in a listening mode. And then Prime Minister PERSON, with whom I have had a long relationship. I knew him when he was the head of the ORG. I can remember, fondly remember riding my mountain bike as hard as I could as he was jogging along the beaches in GPE, needling him on the way by-a sign of close friendship. We have got a good relationship. He is having to make difficult decisions in GPE, and I hope my visit will help boost his courage in doing the right thing in GPE. And then, of course, GPE-I am looking forward to that as well. I am looking forward to seeing the leadership there. GPE has made some very difficult decisions, but necessary decisions. It is going to be-I love going to countries that may not expect to see the GPE President. It is pretty predictable that the President would go to GPE or GPE, probably GPE and GPE, but not necessarily GPE and GPE. And it is going to be a great honor for me to be in your country. I am looking forward to it. I am excited about the trip. I gave a speech DATE. I do not know if you suffered through it or not, but it is -anyway, I was proud to give it, and I meant what I said. And we have got a darn good record, and I am going to be taking that record, on behalf of the NORP people, to ORG and hoping to encourage others to match it. You can call me ORG. Now, given his angry response to missile defense, do you regret choosing GPE and GPE as possible sites for the missile defense? The reason this country has been chosen is because it will make the missile defense system more effective as we provide defenses for most of our ORG allies. Did he disappoint you? He is a-he is concerned about the missile defense system. He thinks it is aimed at him. It is aimed at rogue regimes that would use a missile to achieve political objective or to create unrest. And therefore, I sent Secretary PERSON to see the leadership, the NORP leadership, to explain our intentions. We have invited the NORP to participate, totally transparent-- We are totally transparent in our designs. We want them to see our technologies. PERSON was very instrumental in us reaching out to the NORP; she was deeply concerned about the ramifications of this decision. Secondly, it is-I repeat, we have nothing to hide. PERSON said, you know, this kind of rhetoric is the kind of rhetoric that relives the cold war. We are now into DATE, where we need to deal with the true threats, which are threats of radical extremists who will kill to advance an ideology and the threats of proliferation. And there is a lot of work we can do together to deal with these threats. And that is what I will continue talking to President PERSON about. Yes, it has. What needs to be done to avoid this relationship to degenerate further into a deep and lasting crisis? And in general, on that note, you set up the conversation. For the GPE cannot speak for the GPE-Russian relationship; that is recently where there is been some tension, as you noted, for the GPE relationship. It is a complex relationship where we have got some areas of agreement and some areas of disagreement. We believe strongly in democracy. PERSON will tell me that GPE is a democracy and that he is advancing democracy. We have got some questions about that, of course. We believe that actions taken in GPE, for example-in relation to the actions taken in GPE were-it sent a confusing signal to us. We obviously have got a difficult issue with GPE. We believe we ought to advance the PERSON agreement through ORG. But disagreement on issues does not mean that the relations are not cordial. As a matter of fact, I have found that it is easier to disagree on issues when you have a cordial relationship. It means you can discuss your differences without hostility, which makes it easier that you can find common ground. And we have common ground with GPE on matters like GPE. We have worked closely with GPE in ORG to send a clear signal to the NORP that their attempts at a nuclear weapon will be met with resistance, unified resistance. The issue of proliferation is one where there is good cooperation between GPE and GPE. It is in the world's interest that GPE and GPE and other nations work together to stop proliferators from being able to get a hold of materials that could end up harming innocent people. We have worked with GPE on GPE. As you know, we spoke with CARDINAL voice to the leadership in GPE, that GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE strongly oppose their desire to have a weapons program. And hopefully, we can make progress. In other words, one should not be surprised that there are differences. And the fundamental question in world diplomacy is, how do you deal with the differences? Do you deal with them that ends up, hopefully, creating more opportunities for cooperation, or do you deal with them in such a way as it creates-it widens gulfs and creates more antagonisms? And my relationship with GPE is firm. I tell people what I believe based upon certain principles. But it is going to be in such a way that treats people with respect. I have noticed that PERSON has also had to deal with PERSON and has done so in a very respectful but firm way. And I admire the way she is handled her diplomacy. She has proven herself to be a very strong leader. And for that, I am grateful, and I hope the NORP people are as well. ENTITY, your administration, you just said, offers a lot to GPE to gain acceptance, GPE's acceptance to idea building--missile shield. And at the same time, so far, it does not seem that you offer much to GPE, which is supposed to host the interceptor site. How would you convince people in GPE, who are frankly not that much afraid of uranium threat, but they are listening to the threats from GPE very carefully? First of all, GPE and the GPE are in ORG, and an attack on one is an attack on all. We cannot offer any better security agreement than that, and we mean it. If you are an ally of GPE and ORG and you feel threatened by an outside force, we will help you. I do not believe that there would be-I would certainly hope that GPE will not be threatened again by an outside force. I can understand why people in GPE could be nervous about that. After all, it is been a terrible part of your history. But as an ally in ORG, I cannot make a stronger statement than to say we stand with you, and in this case, this ally actually means it, and so do ORG allies. You know, I am sure there is probably some skepticism from some older folks or those who study history, where GPE had been given assurances and those assurances did not come through. Well, in this case, they will. I do not view GPE as being under any military threat. Obviously, there are differences you have with GPE over meat, and I am very aware of that. It is an ORG matter; it is a matter that PERSON is working hard, as the head of the ORG at this point in time, to address that problem. The best way to compensate GPE for our friendship is to have good, strong bilateral relations. As you know, we have worked hard on different agreements that would help create jobs. It is really the best thing that a relationship can do, is yield tangible benefits for people besides peace and security. And job creation and decent-paying jobs benefit society as a whole. And we will keep it that way. I am sure I will be discussing that with the President. What are the values that you believe you share with this Pope? What common ground you may have with ORG on issues like GPE or GPE or GPE? The common values are respect for human life, human-and dignity. I think His Holy Father will be pleased to know that much of our foreign policy is based on the admonition, to whom much is given, much is required. I look forward to sharing with him our sincere desire to help alleviate poverty and hunger and disease. I will remind him-in FAC DATE, I talked about spending MONEY on our battle against HIV/AIDS, particularly on the continent of Africa. Our initiative is, thus far, a MONEY initiative over DATE, that is helped provide antiretroviral drugs for CARDINAL people in a DATE period, up from CARDINAL. Many of those folks who are helping to carry out that initiative are people from NORP charities or NORP congregations here in GPE. And I will tell him how proud I am of our NORP citizens who have volunteered, in many cases, to help relieve suffering around the world. I will also talk to him about our malaria initiative where we believe we will have gotten help to folks, particularly on the continent of Africa, in the form of nets and insecticides and medicines, to CARDINAL people. I will remind him that this commitment is real and sincere. I believe he believes-look, I do not want to put words in his mouth-I hope he believes in the universality of freedom because I certainly do. In other words, freedom is not just a Western ideal; it is just not the ideal that some people-it is universal in application. I will remind him of my firm belief that freedom is not only universal, but history has proven democracies tend not to war with each other and that the best way to yield the peace-something I long for-is to help people become free. I have read CARDINAL of his works, and I am looking forward to hearing this good, decent, honorable man share some thoughts with me. Just in terms of other issues, I will- if he cares to talk about GPE, I'd love to talk about GPE. We expect there to be elections and free press, free prisoners. You mentioned GPE; I will confirm our strong support for ORG. I am impressed by his courage. And I will explain to him that CARDINAL of the reasons why we felt like it was important to go through with the PERSON trial for the ORG was to enhance ORG. And it is to make it clear that there is been foreign interference in that country, and we expect that foreign interference to stop. I will tell him that there, too, we have got good relations, and I intend to keep them that way. Part of having good relations with a country is being in a position to talk about religious freedoms. I would remind him that I have been to church in GPE and actually found it to be a spiritual experience. But I will assure him that I will continue to make the case for ORG inside of GPE. CARDINAL of the things I do not know if he knows I know, but there has been an attempt to get a good interface between ORG and ORG so that eventually the prescribed leadership, NORP leadership, would be able to have an active role in GPE. So far, ORG has resisted this, but I have been in-received several entreaties from our NORP cardinals here on behalf of His Holy Father to reach out to the NORP. And if he cares, I will be glad to summarize those contacts with him. ENTITY, concerning the shield, the antimissile shield, I know GPE is one of the newest members of ORG. But as I know, the shield will not cover the southeastern part of ORG, including GPE. And there are NORP military facilities in this country, which makes some people nervous there. Are you planning to change the situation? The missile defense that we are talking about is primarily for the longer term missile. And you are right; that will not cover all of ORG. It will cover most of ORG. GPE will be covered by ORG missile defenses for intermediate-range missiles, and I will be glad to make that case. It is important for our ORG-when I am in GPE, it is important for our ORG allies not to feel like defenses apply to some but not everybody. And as you know, we are in discussions about access bases, which also, I would hope, would provide a sense of security. The first goal, of course, is to work with everybody in your neighborhood to try to convince them to be peaceful in the first place so that the defenses are not needed. And as you know, I am deeply concerned about GPE having a nuclear weapon that could fly toward Europe or, for that matter, toward any other allies. And we do not want to ever have ourselves in a position where the world could become blackmailed. And, therefore, CARDINAL way to deal with this issue is through a missile defense system. However, such a weapon, in this particular scenario, would not affect GPE; it would be a much smaller one for which we have different technologies, ORG technologies, available. Yes, you can call me ENTITY. You already told me that once. ENTITY, for better or worse, you undoubtedly changed modern history of this vote. I mean, are you happy with your decisions? Are you comfortable with your decisions? Are you listening to criticism around the world? Yes, PERSON, I hear what people say, and I am very comfortable with my decisions, absolutely. Our country came under attack, and I vowed to the NORP people I would do all in my power to protect it. And it is still under threat. And the best way to protect GPE is to stay on the offense and bring people to justice before they hurt us. we work with allies and friends, and we share intelligence. We help cut off money; we disrupt, jointly-- I also knew that we had to deal with threats before they came to hurt us, whether it be in GPE and GPE; I made the right decisions. And I believe it is in all our interests that these democracies survive. In some cases, GPE and GPE, in some cases, only GPE; either case, they are very important. If democracies cannot help other democracies, then I worry about stability and peace in the long run. Matter of fact, I was amazed by-he asked, do I feel abandoned? I feel that we are in this long-term struggle with a lot of strong allies-a lot. There is a lot of people in GPE that committed resources and manpower and effort. A lot of people in GPE, all the ORG countries have got manpower there, plus a lot of other countries. And, you know, you have got to work at them. I constantly remind people there is a threat. My roommate in college was PERSON. He was from GPE, though. ENTITY, in the run-up to the ORG meeting, our energy-our climate change turnout will be a divisive issue, at least to the NORP press. Does it help to bridge the gap between the GPE position and the NORP position, which includes firm mandatory caps on greenhouse gases? Or have you basically preempted ORG? No, look, first of all, your opening question was, the NORP press is looking for conflict. Is that what you said? I do not want to misquote you. I think, look, if people want to try to figure out a way to be divisive, they will try to create divisions. I do not view it that way. I view this as an effort by concerned nations to reach common accord to actually solve the problem. We will take the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases and come up with an international goal. And I suggested, here is CARDINAL way to deal with the PERSON world. First thing that the Chancellor wanted to know is, did I agree there ought to be a PERSON framework. That is the threshold question, because if it is no, then we can end the conversation; if it is yes, then what are your suggestions? And I believe PERSON will be pleased with that because she is-this was something she was working toward. How we arrive at that goal is-I set out a process where greenhouse gas emitters, including developing nations, ought to be at the table. As you know full well, that one could have a very strict regime on greenhouse gases, but if nothing were done with countries like GPE or GPE, all would be for naught. So I thought it made sense to include a variety of nations that are actually producing greenhouse gases, including GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE and the ORG and others. Thirdly, I said that each nation needs to come up with an interim goal and develop the methodology to achieve that goal. Now, I said this in FAC, next to the Chancellor and PERSON, that each country has got to develop a plan that suits its own economy and suits its own political environment. If you want the GPE to be an active participant, that is the best way to do it as well. A lot of people do not particularly want our environmental policy written by somebody else. They think we ought to be writing our own environmental policy, in this case, to achieve international goals. I am looking forward to it. CARDINAL, energy independent; CARDINAL, economic vitality and growth. And as an active trading partner with GPE, you would want us to be economically strong. And finally, a strong steward of the environment, and technology is going to lead us there. And I look forward to explaining some of the technological breakthroughs that we have achieved and will achieve. You probably do not know this, but we are up to QUANTITY of corn ethanol now being used in our cars. Over DATE, PERCENT of every automobile in GPE will be flex-fuel. In other words, you can either use ethanol or gasoline; your choice. But we are spending MONEY-or MONEY, MONEY, on coming up with the ability to break down different forms of feedstocks to produce ethanol. That is called cellulosic ethanol, like switchgrasses or wood chips. Would not it be remarkable when we have a breakthrough to develop fuel to run our automobiles from wood chips? You got a lot of wood in GPE. I'd be glad to share that technology with you. We will have a mandatory fuel standard that will reduce our gasoline consumption by PERCENT over DATE. No President has ever said that. I happen to believe that there is going to be some significant battery technology breakthroughs as well, and I look forward to sharing that with our partners. Matter of fact, the NORP are spending a lot of money on battery technologies, and it is very conceivable one day we will be having hybrid plug-in battery-driven vehicles with a regular-sized automobile. You can do it with a golf cart now, but on a lot of our freeways, it would be dangerous--yours too. The fundamental question facing GPE is, how fast can we develop CARDINAL-emission coal-fired electricity plants? And we are spending a lot of money there, and we look forward to sharing technologies with our allies and friends and people who need help. And so we have got a very strong agenda that I am looking forward to sharing in ORG. And one of the things I am going to do is encourage others to step up to the research and development arena. They ought to be spending as much as we are. And then we ought to be willing to share that technology with developing countries. And finally, if you are really interested in solving greenhouse gases and making sure your economy grows, you ought to be for civilian nuclear power, And we are spending-we are advancing an interesting initiative with GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE on coming up with new technologies on fast-burner reactors in order to be able to deal with the waste issue. Anyway, there is a lot to talk about, and so I am looking forward to it. just like feeding the hungry is important; just like solving HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa is important; just like dealing with malaria is important; just like poor children, particularly women, girls, getting an education is important. These are all important initiatives, and I cannot wait to discuss them there. Last time you were in Eastern Europe, DATE in GPE and GPE, you promised changes in visa regime for your close allies. I promised I would work on it. ENTITY, make sure you quote me correctly. Yes, let me talk about it. It affects GPE, it affects GPE, and it affects GPE. I fully understand the frustrations of countries and people of countries who have supported friendship with GPE. And they look at neighbors in the ORG or ORG and say, wait TIME; we are treated differently. I understand that. This is an issue that your leaders have spoken very candidly with me. And I told them I did not -I thought it was unfair that the NORP citizen be given a type of visa and not the NORP citizen. And we are working closely with ORG to change long-standing law. First of all, we set up a way forward, a roadmap to visa changes. And I said I would work with our ORG to come up with a fair law that treated people fairly. We have yet to pass the law, but we are working with ORG. There is, as you may or may not know, a healthy immigration debate taking place in GPE. I am a big proponent of what we call comprehensive immigration reform, as I am a proponent of visa reform, visa waiver reform. I cannot give you a firm prediction as to exactly when this will emerge from ORG, but we are working hard to see if we cannot get it done. ENTITY, you said that you hope that your arrival will boost Mr. PERSON's energy on GPE. No, let me rephrase that. Can I restate that? I do not want to boost his energy. I do want to sit down and talk to him about how important the NORP commitment is to GPE and its future, is really what I meant to say. And that was what my question was about. What would you like GPE to do in GPE and, more in general, in the war on terror? How do you see GPE as a global partner on this issue? And, also, if you can spend a few words on the protesters that will receive you in GPE. I am going to meet some protesters in GPE again? They declared DATE. First of all, when you go to free societies, you tend to see protesters. Freedom of speech, that is what we are talking about. I presume there is going to be a few in GPE, just like there were-listen, when world leaders get together, or a leader shows up that people pay attention to, people get on TV by protesting. They have got different causes, and they want to express themselves. And I welcome going to a society where people are free to speak. It is a sign of a robust society. We had a few, one time, in GPE, if you remember. And the other question was about GPE, GPE's role in GPE. First of all, commitment to GPE, itself, helps. We want to help you; we know you are struggling. And it encourages people. The idea of saying we are a robust, free society, and we want to stand with you as you try to develop your own society in your own image is important to the psychology of the country. police training, judicial training. And in the war on terror, the idea of sharing intelligence when we find it, it is in both our interests. If we know somebody is plotting and planning in GPE, we will share that information, and vice versa. And that is really what matters, is the ability to talk to each other in such a way that if we have information that is beneficial for one or the other, we are comfortable enough of sharing that information so we can protect ourselves. Make no mistake about it, the enemy wants to strike again. These are ideologues who have got ambitions, and it is very important that we all take them seriously. the commitment to work together, the commitment to watch their finances, the commitment to understand what they are thinking and what they are doing. And they will kill you like that, in order to achieve their objectives; make no mistake about it. And the temptation is to say, oh, no, it is just a couple of guys that are not that dangerous. They are dangerous, and I will remind our friends. GPE has been a strong partner in a lot of areas, and I appreciate it. Back to GPE-you know that sometimes you spoke about the energy and energy security. Sometimes energy is used as a political tool, especially if there is a sense of-in Eastern Europe that GPE is using its oil and gas as a political tool. Do you have any leverage on GPE and the GPE in this field of energy security? And very crucial events happened during both your terms, and crucial decisions were taken here in this building. What world and what future for this great country do you envision in DATE? I do have, I do not know, DATE? First thing you have got to know about me is, I am going to sprint to the finish. I have got a lot to do, and I am going to work as hard as I can to get it done. You have heard me talk about a lot of issues. We have got an engagement in GPE and GPE, on HIV/AIDS and feeding the hungry and dealing with proliferation, and working on the environment. I believe people ought to have more money in their pocket; that is how you grow your economies. We are talking about health care, a big education reform, and immigration reform. There is a lot to do, and I do not have that much time to think beyond my Presidency. I am occupied with the moment. That is the way-I will put a lot of energy into the final 18 months and give it my all. That is all you can do in life is give it your best. That is what I am going to do. I owe that to the NORP people. My concern for GPE is that we never become an isolationist nation or a protectionist nation. We have had those tendencies in the past. I am not suggesting that is where we are, but I am worried that that might happen at some point in time. Or, It is too difficult to fight the terrorists. Or, It is too difficult to help advance democracy; let us just kind of retreat. I think it would be a huge mistake for GPE. I would hope that DATE GPE still works with other nations to advance liberty. I remind people about my NORP friend Prime Minister PERSON, now Prime Minister PERSON, PERSON, a good guy. Is not it interesting that the GPE President sits at the table with the NORP Prime Minister to talk about peace, and my father fought them, and they were the sworn enemy? And now we are working together on peace. Liberty has got an amazing way of transforming enemies into friends-same in GPE, in many ways. I would hope GPE would never lose sight of that capacity. You have got your worries about supplies of energy, and so do I- where we get our energy from. If you are interested in reducing dependence on crude oil, then what you do is develop different ways to power your automobiles. And so we are using corn to power our automobiles. That way we do not have to use gasoline and therefore use crude oil as a feedstock. My goal is to make us nearly totally independent from foreign sources of oil. And that ought to be the goal of a nation that worries from sole-source supplier, that you ought to figure out different ways to do it. How do you do it? Well, you can do it through nuclear technology, for example; as opposed to using natural gas to power your electricity, use nuclear technology. Hopefully, we can come with clean coal technologies so that you can burn coal. We need to do it in GPE. We have got DATE of coal supply. Coal is a particular problem when it comes to pollution; we know that. We spent MONEY on your ORG plant, clean coal technologies. We believe that we will be able to develop a coal-fired plant that has CARDINAL emissions. And when that technology comes to fruition, if you can get yourself some coal, you have got your ability to diversify away from sole-source supplier of energy. And that is what technology is going to yield. I truly believe over DATE, you are going to see some amazing technological breakthroughs. And I believe and hope that those technological breakthroughs will make a lot of the discussions we are having here at DATE moot, relative to energy security and environmental quality. I believe some of the discussions I have had with you about battery technologies will be real. We are spending MONEY on hydrogen technologies. We believe that cars will be powered by hydrogen, which will obviously relieve pressure on crude oil dependence. The emissions of hydrogen-driven automobiles is going to be driblets of water, which will be good for the environment. And you know, I would hope that mankind does not lose faith in the capacity of technology to transform the way we live in positive ways. Here in GPE, what is interesting is to watch some of the investment flows of private capital. We are a system based upon private capital. And so I talked about, in my speech DATE, about public capital investment, public tax dollars going into research and development, MONEY over DATE that I have been President. But there is enormous sums of money going into the private markets as well, because people see economic opportunity can be derived by new energy technologies. And it is that synergy to be derived from public participation and public policy, the declaration of a mandatory fuel standard coupled with private sector investments that could yield breakthroughs. I like the idea that the NORP are pushing hard for battery technologies. I want our people pushing hard for battery technologies. It yields better product for consumers. It makes us all work more efficiently and wiser in the end. And I am excited to be a part of it. I have got DATE to be a part of it here in this capacity, and it is going to be DATE.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists7", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-journalists-7", "publication_date": "31-05-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 11, "text": "First, I am really looking forward to the trip. It is a chance for me to see old friends, make new friends, and talk about an agenda that is based upon freedom and the obligation, for those of us who benefit from our free societies, to help less fortunate people. Obviously, the ORG is going to be the center point of the visit; it will be where the most focus is. But I take my bilateral visits very seriously. We are starting in GPE. I am looking forward to seeing the President and the Prime Minister. Besides my bilateral meetings with the leadership, I am looking forward to my democracy speech. PERSON has asked me to come and speak to a democracy forum. I feel very strongly that GPE must take the lead in promoting democracy around the world-even in places where it may not look like it could-that it is very hospitable because I believe, ultimately, it is hospitable. And so it is going to be an important speech, and I am working on it. And then, of course, I go to GPE for ORG I have been in that beautiful part of your country before. I am looking forward to the seaside resort. Of course, I am anxious to see the Chancellor. She and I have got a very strong relationship. I do not know if you know this or not, but we do visit via secure video on a fairly regular basis. I have had some-you know, a lot of meaningful conversations with her, other than by phone. And DATE I will be talking about the need for all of us to work together to deal with HIV/AIDS and malaria and education. And, of course, global climate change will be an issue as well. And then we will go on to GPE. I am looking forward to going back-for my third time; twice in GPE, third time in GPE. Of course, part of the discussions with both countries will be on missile defense. I will be glad to answer any questions you have on that. It is just an important issue for us to discuss, and it is an important for me to allay people's fears. My friend PERSON is making this to be a case where somehow this is going to jeopardize relations in Europe, and it is going to make the world a more dangerous place-quite the opposite. The reason one advocates and works for a missile defense system is to protect free peoples from the launch of a missile from a hostile regime. We do not agree with GPE all the time, but nevertheless, I view them as a friendly nation, not a hostile nation. And I will work with PERSON not only at ORG but when he comes to visit up east here. But I know that is going to be part of our conversation. By the way, in the case of GPE, GPE, GPE, and, to a certain extent, GPE, and definitely GPE, there is a lot of obviously, you know, NORP who are very interested in this trip. NORP are-there is a lot of them, and they really love their country of origin, their grandfathers' country of origin. And this is an important trip symbolically, as well, to see their NORP President in GPE-or in GPE, a lot of NORP are very proud of their heritage as well. So the trip obviously is the chance to visit on important issues, whether it be GPE or GPE, where these countries are supportive, as well as their common interests in bilateral issues. I am looking forward to CARDINAL things in GPE, obviously seeing His Holy Father. Sometimes I am not poetic enough to describe what it is like to be in the presence of the Holy Father. And I have not been in the presence of this particular Holy Father. Obviously, CARDINAL visits with the last great man, and I am looking forward to this. I am looking forward to hearing him. I will be in a listening mode. And then Prime Minister PERSON, with whom I have had a long relationship. I knew him when he was the head of the ORG. I can remember, fondly remember riding my mountain bike as hard as I could as he was jogging along the beaches in GPE, needling him on the way by-a sign of close friendship. We have got a good relationship. He is having to make difficult decisions in GPE, and I hope my visit will help boost his courage in doing the right thing in GPE. And then, of course, GPE-I am looking forward to that as well. I am looking forward to seeing the leadership there. GPE has made some very difficult decisions, but necessary decisions. It is going to be-I love going to countries that may not expect to see the GPE President. It is pretty predictable that the President would go to GPE or GPE, probably GPE and GPE, but not necessarily GPE and GPE. And it is going to be a great honor for me to be in your country. I am looking forward to it. I am excited about the trip. I gave a speech DATE. I do not know if you suffered through it or not, but it is -anyway, I was proud to give it, and I meant what I said. And we have got a darn good record, and I am going to be taking that record, on behalf of the NORP people, to ORG and hoping to encourage others to match it. You can call me ORG. Now, given his angry response to missile defense, do you regret choosing GPE and GPE as possible sites for the missile defense? The reason this country has been chosen is because it will make the missile defense system more effective as we provide defenses for most of our ORG allies. Did he disappoint you? He is a-he is concerned about the missile defense system. He thinks it is aimed at him. It is aimed at rogue regimes that would use a missile to achieve political objective or to create unrest. And therefore, I sent Secretary PERSON to see the leadership, the NORP leadership, to explain our intentions. We have invited the NORP to participate, totally transparent-- We are totally transparent in our designs. We want them to see our technologies. PERSON was very instrumental in us reaching out to the NORP; she was deeply concerned about the ramifications of this decision. Secondly, it is-I repeat, we have nothing to hide. PERSON said, you know, this kind of rhetoric is the kind of rhetoric that relives the cold war. We are now into DATE, where we need to deal with the true threats, which are threats of radical extremists who will kill to advance an ideology and the threats of proliferation. And there is a lot of work we can do together to deal with these threats. And that is what I will continue talking to President PERSON about. Yes, it has. What needs to be done to avoid this relationship to degenerate further into a deep and lasting crisis? And in general, on that note, you set up the conversation. For the GPE cannot speak for the GPE-Russian relationship; that is recently where there is been some tension, as you noted, for the GPE relationship. It is a complex relationship where we have got some areas of agreement and some areas of disagreement. We believe strongly in democracy. PERSON will tell me that GPE is a democracy and that he is advancing democracy. We have got some questions about that, of course. We believe that actions taken in GPE, for example-in relation to the actions taken in GPE were-it sent a confusing signal to us. We obviously have got a difficult issue with GPE. We believe we ought to advance the PERSON agreement through ORG. But disagreement on issues does not mean that the relations are not cordial. As a matter of fact, I have found that it is easier to disagree on issues when you have a cordial relationship. It means you can discuss your differences without hostility, which makes it easier that you can find common ground. And we have common ground with GPE on matters like GPE. We have worked closely with GPE in ORG to send a clear signal to the NORP that their attempts at a nuclear weapon will be met with resistance, unified resistance. The issue of proliferation is one where there is good cooperation between GPE and GPE. It is in the world's interest that GPE and GPE and other nations work together to stop proliferators from being able to get a hold of materials that could end up harming innocent people. We have worked with GPE on GPE. As you know, we spoke with CARDINAL voice to the leadership in GPE, that GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE strongly oppose their desire to have a weapons program. And hopefully, we can make progress. In other words, one should not be surprised that there are differences. And the fundamental question in world diplomacy is, how do you deal with the differences? Do you deal with them that ends up, hopefully, creating more opportunities for cooperation, or do you deal with them in such a way as it creates-it widens gulfs and creates more antagonisms? And my relationship with GPE is firm. I tell people what I believe based upon certain principles. But it is going to be in such a way that treats people with respect. I have noticed that PERSON has also had to deal with PERSON and has done so in a very respectful but firm way. And I admire the way she is handled her diplomacy. She has proven herself to be a very strong leader. And for that, I am grateful, and I hope the NORP people are as well. ENTITY, your administration, you just said, offers a lot to GPE to gain acceptance, GPE's acceptance to idea building--missile shield. And at the same time, so far, it does not seem that you offer much to GPE, which is supposed to host the interceptor site. How would you convince people in GPE, who are frankly not that much afraid of uranium threat, but they are listening to the threats from GPE very carefully? First of all, GPE and the GPE are in ORG, and an attack on one is an attack on all. We cannot offer any better security agreement than that, and we mean it. If you are an ally of GPE and ORG and you feel threatened by an outside force, we will help you. I do not believe that there would be-I would certainly hope that GPE will not be threatened again by an outside force. I can understand why people in GPE could be nervous about that. After all, it is been a terrible part of your history. But as an ally in ORG, I cannot make a stronger statement than to say we stand with you, and in this case, this ally actually means it, and so do ORG allies. You know, I am sure there is probably some skepticism from some older folks or those who study history, where GPE had been given assurances and those assurances did not come through. Well, in this case, they will. I do not view GPE as being under any military threat. Obviously, there are differences you have with GPE over meat, and I am very aware of that. It is an ORG matter; it is a matter that PERSON is working hard, as the head of the ORG at this point in time, to address that problem. The best way to compensate GPE for our friendship is to have good, strong bilateral relations. As you know, we have worked hard on different agreements that would help create jobs. It is really the best thing that a relationship can do, is yield tangible benefits for people besides peace and security. And job creation and decent-paying jobs benefit society as a whole. And we will keep it that way. I am sure I will be discussing that with the President. What are the values that you believe you share with this Pope? What common ground you may have with ORG on issues like GPE or GPE or GPE? The common values are respect for human life, human-and dignity. I think His Holy Father will be pleased to know that much of our foreign policy is based on the admonition, to whom much is given, much is required. I look forward to sharing with him our sincere desire to help alleviate poverty and hunger and disease. I will remind him-in FAC DATE, I talked about spending MONEY on our battle against HIV/AIDS, particularly on the continent of Africa. Our initiative is, thus far, a MONEY initiative over DATE, that is helped provide antiretroviral drugs for CARDINAL people in a DATE period, up from CARDINAL. Many of those folks who are helping to carry out that initiative are people from NORP charities or NORP congregations here in GPE. And I will tell him how proud I am of our NORP citizens who have volunteered, in many cases, to help relieve suffering around the world. I will also talk to him about our malaria initiative where we believe we will have gotten help to folks, particularly on the continent of Africa, in the form of nets and insecticides and medicines, to CARDINAL people. I will remind him that this commitment is real and sincere. I believe he believes-look, I do not want to put words in his mouth-I hope he believes in the universality of freedom because I certainly do. In other words, freedom is not just a Western ideal; it is just not the ideal that some people-it is universal in application. I will remind him of my firm belief that freedom is not only universal, but history has proven democracies tend not to war with each other and that the best way to yield the peace-something I long for-is to help people become free. I have read CARDINAL of his works, and I am looking forward to hearing this good, decent, honorable man share some thoughts with me. Just in terms of other issues, I will- if he cares to talk about GPE, I'd love to talk about GPE. We expect there to be elections and free press, free prisoners. You mentioned GPE; I will confirm our strong support for ORG. I am impressed by his courage. And I will explain to him that CARDINAL of the reasons why we felt like it was important to go through with the PERSON trial for the ORG was to enhance ORG. And it is to make it clear that there is been foreign interference in that country, and we expect that foreign interference to stop. I will tell him that there, too, we have got good relations, and I intend to keep them that way. Part of having good relations with a country is being in a position to talk about religious freedoms. I would remind him that I have been to church in GPE and actually found it to be a spiritual experience. But I will assure him that I will continue to make the case for ORG inside of GPE. CARDINAL of the things I do not know if he knows I know, but there has been an attempt to get a good interface between ORG and ORG so that eventually the prescribed leadership, NORP leadership, would be able to have an active role in GPE. So far, ORG has resisted this, but I have been in-received several entreaties from our NORP cardinals here on behalf of His Holy Father to reach out to the NORP. And if he cares, I will be glad to summarize those contacts with him. ENTITY, concerning the shield, the antimissile shield, I know GPE is one of the newest members of ORG. But as I know, the shield will not cover the southeastern part of ORG, including GPE. And there are NORP military facilities in this country, which makes some people nervous there. Are you planning to change the situation? The missile defense that we are talking about is primarily for the longer term missile. And you are right; that will not cover all of ORG. It will cover most of ORG. GPE will be covered by ORG missile defenses for intermediate-range missiles, and I will be glad to make that case. It is important for our ORG-when I am in GPE, it is important for our ORG allies not to feel like defenses apply to some but not everybody. And as you know, we are in discussions about access bases, which also, I would hope, would provide a sense of security. The first goal, of course, is to work with everybody in your neighborhood to try to convince them to be peaceful in the first place so that the defenses are not needed. And as you know, I am deeply concerned about GPE having a nuclear weapon that could fly toward Europe or, for that matter, toward any other allies. And we do not want to ever have ourselves in a position where the world could become blackmailed. And, therefore, CARDINAL way to deal with this issue is through a missile defense system. However, such a weapon, in this particular scenario, would not affect GPE; it would be a much smaller one for which we have different technologies, ORG technologies, available. Yes, you can call me ENTITY. You already told me that once. ENTITY, for better or worse, you undoubtedly changed modern history of this vote. I mean, are you happy with your decisions? Are you comfortable with your decisions? Are you listening to criticism around the world? Yes, PERSON, I hear what people say, and I am very comfortable with my decisions, absolutely. Our country came under attack, and I vowed to the NORP people I would do all in my power to protect it. And it is still under threat. And the best way to protect GPE is to stay on the offense and bring people to justice before they hurt us. we work with allies and friends, and we share intelligence. We help cut off money; we disrupt, jointly-- I also knew that we had to deal with threats before they came to hurt us, whether it be in GPE and GPE; I made the right decisions. And I believe it is in all our interests that these democracies survive. In some cases, GPE and GPE, in some cases, only GPE; either case, they are very important. If democracies cannot help other democracies, then I worry about stability and peace in the long run. Matter of fact, I was amazed by-he asked, do I feel abandoned? I feel that we are in this long-term struggle with a lot of strong allies-a lot. There is a lot of people in GPE that committed resources and manpower and effort. A lot of people in GPE, all the ORG countries have got manpower there, plus a lot of other countries. And, you know, you have got to work at them. I constantly remind people there is a threat. My roommate in college was PERSON. He was from GPE, though. ENTITY, in the run-up to the ORG meeting, our energy-our climate change turnout will be a divisive issue, at least to the NORP press. Does it help to bridge the gap between the GPE position and the NORP position, which includes firm mandatory caps on greenhouse gases? Or have you basically preempted ORG? No, look, first of all, your opening question was, the NORP press is looking for conflict. Is that what you said? I do not want to misquote you. I think, look, if people want to try to figure out a way to be divisive, they will try to create divisions. I do not view it that way. I view this as an effort by concerned nations to reach common accord to actually solve the problem. We will take the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases and come up with an international goal. And I suggested, here is CARDINAL way to deal with the PERSON world. First thing that the Chancellor wanted to know is, did I agree there ought to be a PERSON framework. That is the threshold question, because if it is no, then we can end the conversation; if it is yes, then what are your suggestions? And I believe PERSON will be pleased with that because she is-this was something she was working toward. How we arrive at that goal is-I set out a process where greenhouse gas emitters, including developing nations, ought to be at the table. As you know full well, that one could have a very strict regime on greenhouse gases, but if nothing were done with countries like GPE or GPE, all would be for naught. So I thought it made sense to include a variety of nations that are actually producing greenhouse gases, including GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE and the ORG and others. Thirdly, I said that each nation needs to come up with an interim goal and develop the methodology to achieve that goal. Now, I said this in FAC, next to the Chancellor and PERSON, that each country has got to develop a plan that suits its own economy and suits its own political environment. If you want the GPE to be an active participant, that is the best way to do it as well. A lot of people do not particularly want our environmental policy written by somebody else. They think we ought to be writing our own environmental policy, in this case, to achieve international goals. I am looking forward to it. CARDINAL, energy independent; CARDINAL, economic vitality and growth. And as an active trading partner with GPE, you would want us to be economically strong. And finally, a strong steward of the environment, and technology is going to lead us there. And I look forward to explaining some of the technological breakthroughs that we have achieved and will achieve. You probably do not know this, but we are up to QUANTITY of corn ethanol now being used in our cars. Over DATE, PERCENT of every automobile in GPE will be flex-fuel. In other words, you can either use ethanol or gasoline; your choice. But we are spending MONEY-or MONEY, MONEY, on coming up with the ability to break down different forms of feedstocks to produce ethanol. That is called cellulosic ethanol, like switchgrasses or wood chips. Would not it be remarkable when we have a breakthrough to develop fuel to run our automobiles from wood chips? You got a lot of wood in GPE. I'd be glad to share that technology with you. We will have a mandatory fuel standard that will reduce our gasoline consumption by PERCENT over DATE. No President has ever said that. I happen to believe that there is going to be some significant battery technology breakthroughs as well, and I look forward to sharing that with our partners. Matter of fact, the NORP are spending a lot of money on battery technologies, and it is very conceivable one day we will be having hybrid plug-in battery-driven vehicles with a regular-sized automobile. You can do it with a golf cart now, but on a lot of our freeways, it would be dangerous--yours too. The fundamental question facing GPE is, how fast can we develop CARDINAL-emission coal-fired electricity plants? And we are spending a lot of money there, and we look forward to sharing technologies with our allies and friends and people who need help. And so we have got a very strong agenda that I am looking forward to sharing in ORG. And one of the things I am going to do is encourage others to step up to the research and development arena. They ought to be spending as much as we are. And then we ought to be willing to share that technology with developing countries. And finally, if you are really interested in solving greenhouse gases and making sure your economy grows, you ought to be for civilian nuclear power, And we are spending-we are advancing an interesting initiative with GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE on coming up with new technologies on fast-burner reactors in order to be able to deal with the waste issue. Anyway, there is a lot to talk about, and so I am looking forward to it. just like feeding the hungry is important; just like solving HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa is important; just like dealing with malaria is important; just like poor children, particularly women, girls, getting an education is important. These are all important initiatives, and I cannot wait to discuss them there. Last time you were in Eastern Europe, DATE in GPE and GPE, you promised changes in visa regime for your close allies. I promised I would work on it. ENTITY, make sure you quote me correctly. Yes, let me talk about it. It affects GPE, it affects GPE, and it affects GPE. I fully understand the frustrations of countries and people of countries who have supported friendship with GPE. And they look at neighbors in the ORG or ORG and say, wait TIME; we are treated differently. I understand that. This is an issue that your leaders have spoken very candidly with me. And I told them I did not -I thought it was unfair that the NORP citizen be given a type of visa and not the NORP citizen. And we are working closely with ORG to change long-standing law. First of all, we set up a way forward, a roadmap to visa changes. And I said I would work with our ORG to come up with a fair law that treated people fairly. We have yet to pass the law, but we are working with ORG. There is, as you may or may not know, a healthy immigration debate taking place in GPE. I am a big proponent of what we call comprehensive immigration reform, as I am a proponent of visa reform, visa waiver reform. I cannot give you a firm prediction as to exactly when this will emerge from ORG, but we are working hard to see if we cannot get it done. ENTITY, you said that you hope that your arrival will boost Mr. PERSON's energy on GPE. No, let me rephrase that. Can I restate that? I do not want to boost his energy. I do want to sit down and talk to him about how important the NORP commitment is to GPE and its future, is really what I meant to say. And that was what my question was about. What would you like GPE to do in GPE and, more in general, in the war on terror? How do you see GPE as a global partner on this issue? And, also, if you can spend a few words on the protesters that will receive you in GPE. I am going to meet some protesters in GPE again? They declared DATE. First of all, when you go to free societies, you tend to see protesters. Freedom of speech, that is what we are talking about. I presume there is going to be a few in GPE, just like there were-listen, when world leaders get together, or a leader shows up that people pay attention to, people get on TV by protesting. They have got different causes, and they want to express themselves. And I welcome going to a society where people are free to speak. It is a sign of a robust society. We had a few, one time, in GPE, if you remember. And the other question was about GPE, GPE's role in GPE. First of all, commitment to GPE, itself, helps. We want to help you; we know you are struggling. And it encourages people. The idea of saying we are a robust, free society, and we want to stand with you as you try to develop your own society in your own image is important to the psychology of the country. police training, judicial training. And in the war on terror, the idea of sharing intelligence when we find it, it is in both our interests. If we know somebody is plotting and planning in GPE, we will share that information, and vice versa. And that is really what matters, is the ability to talk to each other in such a way that if we have information that is beneficial for one or the other, we are comfortable enough of sharing that information so we can protect ourselves. Make no mistake about it, the enemy wants to strike again. These are ideologues who have got ambitions, and it is very important that we all take them seriously. the commitment to work together, the commitment to watch their finances, the commitment to understand what they are thinking and what they are doing. And they will kill you like that, in order to achieve their objectives; make no mistake about it. And the temptation is to say, oh, no, it is just a couple of guys that are not that dangerous. They are dangerous, and I will remind our friends. GPE has been a strong partner in a lot of areas, and I appreciate it. Back to GPE-you know that sometimes you spoke about the energy and energy security. Sometimes energy is used as a political tool, especially if there is a sense of-in Eastern Europe that GPE is using its oil and gas as a political tool. Do you have any leverage on GPE and the GPE in this field of energy security? And very crucial events happened during both your terms, and crucial decisions were taken here in this building. What world and what future for this great country do you envision in DATE? I do have, I do not know, DATE? First thing you have got to know about me is, I am going to sprint to the finish. I have got a lot to do, and I am going to work as hard as I can to get it done. You have heard me talk about a lot of issues. We have got an engagement in GPE and GPE, on HIV/AIDS and feeding the hungry and dealing with proliferation, and working on the environment. I believe people ought to have more money in their pocket; that is how you grow your economies. We are talking about health care, a big education reform, and immigration reform. There is a lot to do, and I do not have that much time to think beyond my Presidency. I am occupied with the moment. That is the way-I will put a lot of energy into the final 18 months and give it my all. That is all you can do in life is give it your best. That is what I am going to do. I owe that to the NORP people. My concern for GPE is that we never become an isolationist nation or a protectionist nation. We have had those tendencies in the past. I am not suggesting that is where we are, but I am worried that that might happen at some point in time. Or, It is too difficult to fight the terrorists. Or, It is too difficult to help advance democracy; let us just kind of retreat. I think it would be a huge mistake for GPE. I would hope that DATE GPE still works with other nations to advance liberty. I remind people about my NORP friend Prime Minister PERSON, now Prime Minister PERSON, PERSON, a good guy. Is not it interesting that the GPE President sits at the table with the NORP Prime Minister to talk about peace, and my father fought them, and they were the sworn enemy? And now we are working together on peace. Liberty has got an amazing way of transforming enemies into friends-same in GPE, in many ways. I would hope GPE would never lose sight of that capacity. You have got your worries about supplies of energy, and so do I- where we get our energy from. If you are interested in reducing dependence on crude oil, then what you do is develop different ways to power your automobiles. And so we are using corn to power our automobiles. That way we do not have to use gasoline and therefore use crude oil as a feedstock. My goal is to make us nearly totally independent from foreign sources of oil. And that ought to be the goal of a nation that worries from sole-source supplier, that you ought to figure out different ways to do it. How do you do it? Well, you can do it through nuclear technology, for example; as opposed to using natural gas to power your electricity, use nuclear technology. Hopefully, we can come with clean coal technologies so that you can burn coal. We need to do it in GPE. We have got DATE of coal supply. Coal is a particular problem when it comes to pollution; we know that. We spent MONEY on your ORG plant, clean coal technologies. We believe that we will be able to develop a coal-fired plant that has CARDINAL emissions. And when that technology comes to fruition, if you can get yourself some coal, you have got your ability to diversify away from sole-source supplier of energy. And that is what technology is going to yield. I truly believe over DATE, you are going to see some amazing technological breakthroughs. And I believe and hope that those technological breakthroughs will make a lot of the discussions we are having here at DATE moot, relative to energy security and environmental quality. I believe some of the discussions I have had with you about battery technologies will be real. We are spending MONEY on hydrogen technologies. We believe that cars will be powered by hydrogen, which will obviously relieve pressure on crude oil dependence. The emissions of hydrogen-driven automobiles is going to be driblets of water, which will be good for the environment. And you know, I would hope that mankind does not lose faith in the capacity of technology to transform the way we live in positive ways. Here in GPE, what is interesting is to watch some of the investment flows of private capital. We are a system based upon private capital. And so I talked about, in my speech DATE, about public capital investment, public tax dollars going into research and development, MONEY over DATE that I have been President. But there is enormous sums of money going into the private markets as well, because people see economic opportunity can be derived by new energy technologies. And it is that synergy to be derived from public participation and public policy, the declaration of a mandatory fuel standard coupled with private sector investments that could yield breakthroughs. I like the idea that the NORP are pushing hard for battery technologies. I want our people pushing hard for battery technologies. It yields better product for consumers. It makes us all work more efficiently and wiser in the end. And I am excited to be a part of it. I have got DATE to be a part of it here in this capacity, and it is going to be DATE.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists7", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-journalists-7", "publication_date": "31-05-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 11, "text": "First, I am really looking forward to the trip. It is a chance for me to see old friends, make new friends, and talk about an agenda that is based upon freedom and the obligation, for those of us who benefit from our free societies, to help less fortunate people. Obviously, the ORG is going to be the center point of the visit; it will be where the most focus is. But I take my bilateral visits very seriously. We are starting in GPE. I am looking forward to seeing the President and the Prime Minister. Besides my bilateral meetings with the leadership, I am looking forward to my democracy speech. PERSON has asked me to come and speak to a democracy forum. I feel very strongly that GPE must take the lead in promoting democracy around the world-even in places where it may not look like it could-that it is very hospitable because I believe, ultimately, it is hospitable. And so it is going to be an important speech, and I am working on it. And then, of course, I go to GPE for ORG I have been in that beautiful part of your country before. I am looking forward to the seaside resort. Of course, I am anxious to see the Chancellor. She and I have got a very strong relationship. I do not know if you know this or not, but we do visit via secure video on a fairly regular basis. I have had some-you know, a lot of meaningful conversations with her, other than by phone. And DATE I will be talking about the need for all of us to work together to deal with HIV/AIDS and malaria and education. And, of course, global climate change will be an issue as well. And then we will go on to GPE. I am looking forward to going back-for my third time; twice in GPE, third time in GPE. Of course, part of the discussions with both countries will be on missile defense. I will be glad to answer any questions you have on that. It is just an important issue for us to discuss, and it is an important for me to allay people's fears. My friend PERSON is making this to be a case where somehow this is going to jeopardize relations in Europe, and it is going to make the world a more dangerous place-quite the opposite. The reason one advocates and works for a missile defense system is to protect free peoples from the launch of a missile from a hostile regime. We do not agree with GPE all the time, but nevertheless, I view them as a friendly nation, not a hostile nation. And I will work with PERSON not only at ORG but when he comes to visit up east here. But I know that is going to be part of our conversation. By the way, in the case of GPE, GPE, GPE, and, to a certain extent, GPE, and definitely GPE, there is a lot of obviously, you know, NORP who are very interested in this trip. NORP are-there is a lot of them, and they really love their country of origin, their grandfathers' country of origin. And this is an important trip symbolically, as well, to see their NORP President in GPE-or in GPE, a lot of NORP are very proud of their heritage as well. So the trip obviously is the chance to visit on important issues, whether it be GPE or GPE, where these countries are supportive, as well as their common interests in bilateral issues. I am looking forward to CARDINAL things in GPE, obviously seeing His Holy Father. Sometimes I am not poetic enough to describe what it is like to be in the presence of the Holy Father. And I have not been in the presence of this particular Holy Father. Obviously, CARDINAL visits with the last great man, and I am looking forward to this. I am looking forward to hearing him. I will be in a listening mode. And then Prime Minister PERSON, with whom I have had a long relationship. I knew him when he was the head of the ORG. I can remember, fondly remember riding my mountain bike as hard as I could as he was jogging along the beaches in GPE, needling him on the way by-a sign of close friendship. We have got a good relationship. He is having to make difficult decisions in GPE, and I hope my visit will help boost his courage in doing the right thing in GPE. And then, of course, GPE-I am looking forward to that as well. I am looking forward to seeing the leadership there. GPE has made some very difficult decisions, but necessary decisions. It is going to be-I love going to countries that may not expect to see the GPE President. It is pretty predictable that the President would go to GPE or GPE, probably GPE and GPE, but not necessarily GPE and GPE. And it is going to be a great honor for me to be in your country. I am looking forward to it. I am excited about the trip. I gave a speech DATE. I do not know if you suffered through it or not, but it is -anyway, I was proud to give it, and I meant what I said. And we have got a darn good record, and I am going to be taking that record, on behalf of the NORP people, to ORG and hoping to encourage others to match it. You can call me ORG. Now, given his angry response to missile defense, do you regret choosing GPE and GPE as possible sites for the missile defense? The reason this country has been chosen is because it will make the missile defense system more effective as we provide defenses for most of our ORG allies. Did he disappoint you? He is a-he is concerned about the missile defense system. He thinks it is aimed at him. It is aimed at rogue regimes that would use a missile to achieve political objective or to create unrest. And therefore, I sent Secretary PERSON to see the leadership, the NORP leadership, to explain our intentions. We have invited the NORP to participate, totally transparent-- We are totally transparent in our designs. We want them to see our technologies. PERSON was very instrumental in us reaching out to the NORP; she was deeply concerned about the ramifications of this decision. Secondly, it is-I repeat, we have nothing to hide. PERSON said, you know, this kind of rhetoric is the kind of rhetoric that relives the cold war. We are now into DATE, where we need to deal with the true threats, which are threats of radical extremists who will kill to advance an ideology and the threats of proliferation. And there is a lot of work we can do together to deal with these threats. And that is what I will continue talking to President PERSON about. Yes, it has. What needs to be done to avoid this relationship to degenerate further into a deep and lasting crisis? And in general, on that note, you set up the conversation. For the GPE cannot speak for the GPE-Russian relationship; that is recently where there is been some tension, as you noted, for the GPE relationship. It is a complex relationship where we have got some areas of agreement and some areas of disagreement. We believe strongly in democracy. PERSON will tell me that GPE is a democracy and that he is advancing democracy. We have got some questions about that, of course. We believe that actions taken in GPE, for example-in relation to the actions taken in GPE were-it sent a confusing signal to us. We obviously have got a difficult issue with GPE. We believe we ought to advance the PERSON agreement through ORG. But disagreement on issues does not mean that the relations are not cordial. As a matter of fact, I have found that it is easier to disagree on issues when you have a cordial relationship. It means you can discuss your differences without hostility, which makes it easier that you can find common ground. And we have common ground with GPE on matters like GPE. We have worked closely with GPE in ORG to send a clear signal to the NORP that their attempts at a nuclear weapon will be met with resistance, unified resistance. The issue of proliferation is one where there is good cooperation between GPE and GPE. It is in the world's interest that GPE and GPE and other nations work together to stop proliferators from being able to get a hold of materials that could end up harming innocent people. We have worked with GPE on GPE. As you know, we spoke with CARDINAL voice to the leadership in GPE, that GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE strongly oppose their desire to have a weapons program. And hopefully, we can make progress. In other words, one should not be surprised that there are differences. And the fundamental question in world diplomacy is, how do you deal with the differences? Do you deal with them that ends up, hopefully, creating more opportunities for cooperation, or do you deal with them in such a way as it creates-it widens gulfs and creates more antagonisms? And my relationship with GPE is firm. I tell people what I believe based upon certain principles. But it is going to be in such a way that treats people with respect. I have noticed that PERSON has also had to deal with PERSON and has done so in a very respectful but firm way. And I admire the way she is handled her diplomacy. She has proven herself to be a very strong leader. And for that, I am grateful, and I hope the NORP people are as well. ENTITY, your administration, you just said, offers a lot to GPE to gain acceptance, GPE's acceptance to idea building--missile shield. And at the same time, so far, it does not seem that you offer much to GPE, which is supposed to host the interceptor site. How would you convince people in GPE, who are frankly not that much afraid of uranium threat, but they are listening to the threats from GPE very carefully? First of all, GPE and the GPE are in ORG, and an attack on one is an attack on all. We cannot offer any better security agreement than that, and we mean it. If you are an ally of GPE and ORG and you feel threatened by an outside force, we will help you. I do not believe that there would be-I would certainly hope that GPE will not be threatened again by an outside force. I can understand why people in GPE could be nervous about that. After all, it is been a terrible part of your history. But as an ally in ORG, I cannot make a stronger statement than to say we stand with you, and in this case, this ally actually means it, and so do ORG allies. You know, I am sure there is probably some skepticism from some older folks or those who study history, where GPE had been given assurances and those assurances did not come through. Well, in this case, they will. I do not view GPE as being under any military threat. Obviously, there are differences you have with GPE over meat, and I am very aware of that. It is an ORG matter; it is a matter that PERSON is working hard, as the head of the ORG at this point in time, to address that problem. The best way to compensate GPE for our friendship is to have good, strong bilateral relations. As you know, we have worked hard on different agreements that would help create jobs. It is really the best thing that a relationship can do, is yield tangible benefits for people besides peace and security. And job creation and decent-paying jobs benefit society as a whole. And we will keep it that way. I am sure I will be discussing that with the President. What are the values that you believe you share with this Pope? What common ground you may have with ORG on issues like GPE or GPE or GPE? The common values are respect for human life, human-and dignity. I think His Holy Father will be pleased to know that much of our foreign policy is based on the admonition, to whom much is given, much is required. I look forward to sharing with him our sincere desire to help alleviate poverty and hunger and disease. I will remind him-in FAC DATE, I talked about spending MONEY on our battle against HIV/AIDS, particularly on the continent of Africa. Our initiative is, thus far, a MONEY initiative over DATE, that is helped provide antiretroviral drugs for CARDINAL people in a DATE period, up from CARDINAL. Many of those folks who are helping to carry out that initiative are people from NORP charities or NORP congregations here in GPE. And I will tell him how proud I am of our NORP citizens who have volunteered, in many cases, to help relieve suffering around the world. I will also talk to him about our malaria initiative where we believe we will have gotten help to folks, particularly on the continent of Africa, in the form of nets and insecticides and medicines, to CARDINAL people. I will remind him that this commitment is real and sincere. I believe he believes-look, I do not want to put words in his mouth-I hope he believes in the universality of freedom because I certainly do. In other words, freedom is not just a Western ideal; it is just not the ideal that some people-it is universal in application. I will remind him of my firm belief that freedom is not only universal, but history has proven democracies tend not to war with each other and that the best way to yield the peace-something I long for-is to help people become free. I have read CARDINAL of his works, and I am looking forward to hearing this good, decent, honorable man share some thoughts with me. Just in terms of other issues, I will- if he cares to talk about GPE, I'd love to talk about GPE. We expect there to be elections and free press, free prisoners. You mentioned GPE; I will confirm our strong support for ORG. I am impressed by his courage. And I will explain to him that CARDINAL of the reasons why we felt like it was important to go through with the PERSON trial for the ORG was to enhance ORG. And it is to make it clear that there is been foreign interference in that country, and we expect that foreign interference to stop. I will tell him that there, too, we have got good relations, and I intend to keep them that way. Part of having good relations with a country is being in a position to talk about religious freedoms. I would remind him that I have been to church in GPE and actually found it to be a spiritual experience. But I will assure him that I will continue to make the case for ORG inside of GPE. CARDINAL of the things I do not know if he knows I know, but there has been an attempt to get a good interface between ORG and ORG so that eventually the prescribed leadership, NORP leadership, would be able to have an active role in GPE. So far, ORG has resisted this, but I have been in-received several entreaties from our NORP cardinals here on behalf of His Holy Father to reach out to the NORP. And if he cares, I will be glad to summarize those contacts with him. ENTITY, concerning the shield, the antimissile shield, I know GPE is one of the newest members of ORG. But as I know, the shield will not cover the southeastern part of ORG, including GPE. And there are NORP military facilities in this country, which makes some people nervous there. Are you planning to change the situation? The missile defense that we are talking about is primarily for the longer term missile. And you are right; that will not cover all of ORG. It will cover most of ORG. GPE will be covered by ORG missile defenses for intermediate-range missiles, and I will be glad to make that case. It is important for our ORG-when I am in GPE, it is important for our ORG allies not to feel like defenses apply to some but not everybody. And as you know, we are in discussions about access bases, which also, I would hope, would provide a sense of security. The first goal, of course, is to work with everybody in your neighborhood to try to convince them to be peaceful in the first place so that the defenses are not needed. And as you know, I am deeply concerned about GPE having a nuclear weapon that could fly toward Europe or, for that matter, toward any other allies. And we do not want to ever have ourselves in a position where the world could become blackmailed. And, therefore, CARDINAL way to deal with this issue is through a missile defense system. However, such a weapon, in this particular scenario, would not affect GPE; it would be a much smaller one for which we have different technologies, ORG technologies, available. Yes, you can call me ENTITY. You already told me that once. ENTITY, for better or worse, you undoubtedly changed modern history of this vote. I mean, are you happy with your decisions? Are you comfortable with your decisions? Are you listening to criticism around the world? Yes, PERSON, I hear what people say, and I am very comfortable with my decisions, absolutely. Our country came under attack, and I vowed to the NORP people I would do all in my power to protect it. And it is still under threat. And the best way to protect GPE is to stay on the offense and bring people to justice before they hurt us. we work with allies and friends, and we share intelligence. We help cut off money; we disrupt, jointly-- I also knew that we had to deal with threats before they came to hurt us, whether it be in GPE and GPE; I made the right decisions. And I believe it is in all our interests that these democracies survive. In some cases, GPE and GPE, in some cases, only GPE; either case, they are very important. If democracies cannot help other democracies, then I worry about stability and peace in the long run. Matter of fact, I was amazed by-he asked, do I feel abandoned? I feel that we are in this long-term struggle with a lot of strong allies-a lot. There is a lot of people in GPE that committed resources and manpower and effort. A lot of people in GPE, all the ORG countries have got manpower there, plus a lot of other countries. And, you know, you have got to work at them. I constantly remind people there is a threat. My roommate in college was PERSON. He was from GPE, though. ENTITY, in the run-up to the ORG meeting, our energy-our climate change turnout will be a divisive issue, at least to the NORP press. Does it help to bridge the gap between the GPE position and the NORP position, which includes firm mandatory caps on greenhouse gases? Or have you basically preempted ORG? No, look, first of all, your opening question was, the NORP press is looking for conflict. Is that what you said? I do not want to misquote you. I think, look, if people want to try to figure out a way to be divisive, they will try to create divisions. I do not view it that way. I view this as an effort by concerned nations to reach common accord to actually solve the problem. We will take the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases and come up with an international goal. And I suggested, here is CARDINAL way to deal with the PERSON world. First thing that the Chancellor wanted to know is, did I agree there ought to be a PERSON framework. That is the threshold question, because if it is no, then we can end the conversation; if it is yes, then what are your suggestions? And I believe PERSON will be pleased with that because she is-this was something she was working toward. How we arrive at that goal is-I set out a process where greenhouse gas emitters, including developing nations, ought to be at the table. As you know full well, that one could have a very strict regime on greenhouse gases, but if nothing were done with countries like GPE or GPE, all would be for naught. So I thought it made sense to include a variety of nations that are actually producing greenhouse gases, including GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE and the ORG and others. Thirdly, I said that each nation needs to come up with an interim goal and develop the methodology to achieve that goal. Now, I said this in FAC, next to the Chancellor and PERSON, that each country has got to develop a plan that suits its own economy and suits its own political environment. If you want the GPE to be an active participant, that is the best way to do it as well. A lot of people do not particularly want our environmental policy written by somebody else. They think we ought to be writing our own environmental policy, in this case, to achieve international goals. I am looking forward to it. CARDINAL, energy independent; CARDINAL, economic vitality and growth. And as an active trading partner with GPE, you would want us to be economically strong. And finally, a strong steward of the environment, and technology is going to lead us there. And I look forward to explaining some of the technological breakthroughs that we have achieved and will achieve. You probably do not know this, but we are up to QUANTITY of corn ethanol now being used in our cars. Over DATE, PERCENT of every automobile in GPE will be flex-fuel. In other words, you can either use ethanol or gasoline; your choice. But we are spending MONEY-or MONEY, MONEY, on coming up with the ability to break down different forms of feedstocks to produce ethanol. That is called cellulosic ethanol, like switchgrasses or wood chips. Would not it be remarkable when we have a breakthrough to develop fuel to run our automobiles from wood chips? You got a lot of wood in GPE. I'd be glad to share that technology with you. We will have a mandatory fuel standard that will reduce our gasoline consumption by PERCENT over DATE. No President has ever said that. I happen to believe that there is going to be some significant battery technology breakthroughs as well, and I look forward to sharing that with our partners. Matter of fact, the NORP are spending a lot of money on battery technologies, and it is very conceivable one day we will be having hybrid plug-in battery-driven vehicles with a regular-sized automobile. You can do it with a golf cart now, but on a lot of our freeways, it would be dangerous--yours too. The fundamental question facing GPE is, how fast can we develop CARDINAL-emission coal-fired electricity plants? And we are spending a lot of money there, and we look forward to sharing technologies with our allies and friends and people who need help. And so we have got a very strong agenda that I am looking forward to sharing in ORG. And one of the things I am going to do is encourage others to step up to the research and development arena. They ought to be spending as much as we are. And then we ought to be willing to share that technology with developing countries. And finally, if you are really interested in solving greenhouse gases and making sure your economy grows, you ought to be for civilian nuclear power, And we are spending-we are advancing an interesting initiative with GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE on coming up with new technologies on fast-burner reactors in order to be able to deal with the waste issue. Anyway, there is a lot to talk about, and so I am looking forward to it. just like feeding the hungry is important; just like solving HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa is important; just like dealing with malaria is important; just like poor children, particularly women, girls, getting an education is important. These are all important initiatives, and I cannot wait to discuss them there. Last time you were in Eastern Europe, DATE in GPE and GPE, you promised changes in visa regime for your close allies. I promised I would work on it. ENTITY, make sure you quote me correctly. Yes, let me talk about it. It affects GPE, it affects GPE, and it affects GPE. I fully understand the frustrations of countries and people of countries who have supported friendship with GPE. And they look at neighbors in the ORG or ORG and say, wait TIME; we are treated differently. I understand that. This is an issue that your leaders have spoken very candidly with me. And I told them I did not -I thought it was unfair that the NORP citizen be given a type of visa and not the NORP citizen. And we are working closely with ORG to change long-standing law. First of all, we set up a way forward, a roadmap to visa changes. And I said I would work with our ORG to come up with a fair law that treated people fairly. We have yet to pass the law, but we are working with ORG. There is, as you may or may not know, a healthy immigration debate taking place in GPE. I am a big proponent of what we call comprehensive immigration reform, as I am a proponent of visa reform, visa waiver reform. I cannot give you a firm prediction as to exactly when this will emerge from ORG, but we are working hard to see if we cannot get it done. ENTITY, you said that you hope that your arrival will boost Mr. PERSON's energy on GPE. No, let me rephrase that. Can I restate that? I do not want to boost his energy. I do want to sit down and talk to him about how important the NORP commitment is to GPE and its future, is really what I meant to say. And that was what my question was about. What would you like GPE to do in GPE and, more in general, in the war on terror? How do you see GPE as a global partner on this issue? And, also, if you can spend a few words on the protesters that will receive you in GPE. I am going to meet some protesters in GPE again? They declared DATE. First of all, when you go to free societies, you tend to see protesters. Freedom of speech, that is what we are talking about. I presume there is going to be a few in GPE, just like there were-listen, when world leaders get together, or a leader shows up that people pay attention to, people get on TV by protesting. They have got different causes, and they want to express themselves. And I welcome going to a society where people are free to speak. It is a sign of a robust society. We had a few, one time, in GPE, if you remember. And the other question was about GPE, GPE's role in GPE. First of all, commitment to GPE, itself, helps. We want to help you; we know you are struggling. And it encourages people. The idea of saying we are a robust, free society, and we want to stand with you as you try to develop your own society in your own image is important to the psychology of the country. police training, judicial training. And in the war on terror, the idea of sharing intelligence when we find it, it is in both our interests. If we know somebody is plotting and planning in GPE, we will share that information, and vice versa. And that is really what matters, is the ability to talk to each other in such a way that if we have information that is beneficial for one or the other, we are comfortable enough of sharing that information so we can protect ourselves. Make no mistake about it, the enemy wants to strike again. These are ideologues who have got ambitions, and it is very important that we all take them seriously. the commitment to work together, the commitment to watch their finances, the commitment to understand what they are thinking and what they are doing. And they will kill you like that, in order to achieve their objectives; make no mistake about it. And the temptation is to say, oh, no, it is just a couple of guys that are not that dangerous. They are dangerous, and I will remind our friends. GPE has been a strong partner in a lot of areas, and I appreciate it. Back to GPE-you know that sometimes you spoke about the energy and energy security. Sometimes energy is used as a political tool, especially if there is a sense of-in Eastern Europe that GPE is using its oil and gas as a political tool. Do you have any leverage on GPE and the GPE in this field of energy security? And very crucial events happened during both your terms, and crucial decisions were taken here in this building. What world and what future for this great country do you envision in DATE? I do have, I do not know, DATE? First thing you have got to know about me is, I am going to sprint to the finish. I have got a lot to do, and I am going to work as hard as I can to get it done. You have heard me talk about a lot of issues. We have got an engagement in GPE and GPE, on HIV/AIDS and feeding the hungry and dealing with proliferation, and working on the environment. I believe people ought to have more money in their pocket; that is how you grow your economies. We are talking about health care, a big education reform, and immigration reform. There is a lot to do, and I do not have that much time to think beyond my Presidency. I am occupied with the moment. That is the way-I will put a lot of energy into the final 18 months and give it my all. That is all you can do in life is give it your best. That is what I am going to do. I owe that to the NORP people. My concern for GPE is that we never become an isolationist nation or a protectionist nation. We have had those tendencies in the past. I am not suggesting that is where we are, but I am worried that that might happen at some point in time. Or, It is too difficult to fight the terrorists. Or, It is too difficult to help advance democracy; let us just kind of retreat. I think it would be a huge mistake for GPE. I would hope that DATE GPE still works with other nations to advance liberty. I remind people about my NORP friend Prime Minister PERSON, now Prime Minister PERSON, PERSON, a good guy. Is not it interesting that the GPE President sits at the table with the NORP Prime Minister to talk about peace, and my father fought them, and they were the sworn enemy? And now we are working together on peace. Liberty has got an amazing way of transforming enemies into friends-same in GPE, in many ways. I would hope GPE would never lose sight of that capacity. You have got your worries about supplies of energy, and so do I- where we get our energy from. If you are interested in reducing dependence on crude oil, then what you do is develop different ways to power your automobiles. And so we are using corn to power our automobiles. That way we do not have to use gasoline and therefore use crude oil as a feedstock. My goal is to make us nearly totally independent from foreign sources of oil. And that ought to be the goal of a nation that worries from sole-source supplier, that you ought to figure out different ways to do it. How do you do it? Well, you can do it through nuclear technology, for example; as opposed to using natural gas to power your electricity, use nuclear technology. Hopefully, we can come with clean coal technologies so that you can burn coal. We need to do it in GPE. We have got DATE of coal supply. Coal is a particular problem when it comes to pollution; we know that. We spent MONEY on your ORG plant, clean coal technologies. We believe that we will be able to develop a coal-fired plant that has CARDINAL emissions. And when that technology comes to fruition, if you can get yourself some coal, you have got your ability to diversify away from sole-source supplier of energy. And that is what technology is going to yield. I truly believe over DATE, you are going to see some amazing technological breakthroughs. And I believe and hope that those technological breakthroughs will make a lot of the discussions we are having here at DATE moot, relative to energy security and environmental quality. I believe some of the discussions I have had with you about battery technologies will be real. We are spending MONEY on hydrogen technologies. We believe that cars will be powered by hydrogen, which will obviously relieve pressure on crude oil dependence. The emissions of hydrogen-driven automobiles is going to be driblets of water, which will be good for the environment. And you know, I would hope that mankind does not lose faith in the capacity of technology to transform the way we live in positive ways. Here in GPE, what is interesting is to watch some of the investment flows of private capital. We are a system based upon private capital. And so I talked about, in my speech DATE, about public capital investment, public tax dollars going into research and development, MONEY over DATE that I have been President. But there is enormous sums of money going into the private markets as well, because people see economic opportunity can be derived by new energy technologies. And it is that synergy to be derived from public participation and public policy, the declaration of a mandatory fuel standard coupled with private sector investments that could yield breakthroughs. I like the idea that the NORP are pushing hard for battery technologies. I want our people pushing hard for battery technologies. It yields better product for consumers. It makes us all work more efficiently and wiser in the end. And I am excited to be a part of it. I have got DATE to be a part of it here in this capacity, and it is going to be DATE.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists7", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-journalists-7", "publication_date": "31-05-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 11, "text": "First, I am really looking forward to the trip. It is a chance for me to see old friends, make new friends, and talk about an agenda that is based upon freedom and the obligation, for those of us who benefit from our free societies, to help less fortunate people. Obviously, the ORG is going to be the center point of the visit; it will be where the most focus is. But I take my bilateral visits very seriously. We are starting in GPE. I am looking forward to seeing the President and the Prime Minister. Besides my bilateral meetings with the leadership, I am looking forward to my democracy speech. PERSON has asked me to come and speak to a democracy forum. I feel very strongly that GPE must take the lead in promoting democracy around the world-even in places where it may not look like it could-that it is very hospitable because I believe, ultimately, it is hospitable. And so it is going to be an important speech, and I am working on it. And then, of course, I go to GPE for ORG I have been in that beautiful part of your country before. I am looking forward to the seaside resort. Of course, I am anxious to see the Chancellor. She and I have got a very strong relationship. I do not know if you know this or not, but we do visit via secure video on a fairly regular basis. I have had some-you know, a lot of meaningful conversations with her, other than by phone. And DATE I will be talking about the need for all of us to work together to deal with HIV/AIDS and malaria and education. And, of course, global climate change will be an issue as well. And then we will go on to GPE. I am looking forward to going back-for my third time; twice in GPE, third time in GPE. Of course, part of the discussions with both countries will be on missile defense. I will be glad to answer any questions you have on that. It is just an important issue for us to discuss, and it is an important for me to allay people's fears. My friend PERSON is making this to be a case where somehow this is going to jeopardize relations in Europe, and it is going to make the world a more dangerous place-quite the opposite. The reason one advocates and works for a missile defense system is to protect free peoples from the launch of a missile from a hostile regime. We do not agree with GPE all the time, but nevertheless, I view them as a friendly nation, not a hostile nation. And I will work with PERSON not only at ORG but when he comes to visit up east here. But I know that is going to be part of our conversation. By the way, in the case of GPE, GPE, GPE, and, to a certain extent, GPE, and definitely GPE, there is a lot of obviously, you know, NORP who are very interested in this trip. NORP are-there is a lot of them, and they really love their country of origin, their grandfathers' country of origin. And this is an important trip symbolically, as well, to see their NORP President in GPE-or in GPE, a lot of NORP are very proud of their heritage as well. So the trip obviously is the chance to visit on important issues, whether it be GPE or GPE, where these countries are supportive, as well as their common interests in bilateral issues. I am looking forward to CARDINAL things in GPE, obviously seeing His Holy Father. Sometimes I am not poetic enough to describe what it is like to be in the presence of the Holy Father. And I have not been in the presence of this particular Holy Father. Obviously, CARDINAL visits with the last great man, and I am looking forward to this. I am looking forward to hearing him. I will be in a listening mode. And then Prime Minister PERSON, with whom I have had a long relationship. I knew him when he was the head of the ORG. I can remember, fondly remember riding my mountain bike as hard as I could as he was jogging along the beaches in GPE, needling him on the way by-a sign of close friendship. We have got a good relationship. He is having to make difficult decisions in GPE, and I hope my visit will help boost his courage in doing the right thing in GPE. And then, of course, GPE-I am looking forward to that as well. I am looking forward to seeing the leadership there. GPE has made some very difficult decisions, but necessary decisions. It is going to be-I love going to countries that may not expect to see the GPE President. It is pretty predictable that the President would go to GPE or GPE, probably GPE and GPE, but not necessarily GPE and GPE. And it is going to be a great honor for me to be in your country. I am looking forward to it. I am excited about the trip. I gave a speech DATE. I do not know if you suffered through it or not, but it is -anyway, I was proud to give it, and I meant what I said. And we have got a darn good record, and I am going to be taking that record, on behalf of the NORP people, to ORG and hoping to encourage others to match it. You can call me ORG. Now, given his angry response to missile defense, do you regret choosing GPE and GPE as possible sites for the missile defense? The reason this country has been chosen is because it will make the missile defense system more effective as we provide defenses for most of our ORG allies. Did he disappoint you? He is a-he is concerned about the missile defense system. He thinks it is aimed at him. It is aimed at rogue regimes that would use a missile to achieve political objective or to create unrest. And therefore, I sent Secretary PERSON to see the leadership, the NORP leadership, to explain our intentions. We have invited the NORP to participate, totally transparent-- We are totally transparent in our designs. We want them to see our technologies. PERSON was very instrumental in us reaching out to the NORP; she was deeply concerned about the ramifications of this decision. Secondly, it is-I repeat, we have nothing to hide. PERSON said, you know, this kind of rhetoric is the kind of rhetoric that relives the cold war. We are now into DATE, where we need to deal with the true threats, which are threats of radical extremists who will kill to advance an ideology and the threats of proliferation. And there is a lot of work we can do together to deal with these threats. And that is what I will continue talking to President PERSON about. Yes, it has. What needs to be done to avoid this relationship to degenerate further into a deep and lasting crisis? And in general, on that note, you set up the conversation. For the GPE cannot speak for the GPE-Russian relationship; that is recently where there is been some tension, as you noted, for the GPE relationship. It is a complex relationship where we have got some areas of agreement and some areas of disagreement. We believe strongly in democracy. PERSON will tell me that GPE is a democracy and that he is advancing democracy. We have got some questions about that, of course. We believe that actions taken in GPE, for example-in relation to the actions taken in GPE were-it sent a confusing signal to us. We obviously have got a difficult issue with GPE. We believe we ought to advance the PERSON agreement through ORG. But disagreement on issues does not mean that the relations are not cordial. As a matter of fact, I have found that it is easier to disagree on issues when you have a cordial relationship. It means you can discuss your differences without hostility, which makes it easier that you can find common ground. And we have common ground with GPE on matters like GPE. We have worked closely with GPE in ORG to send a clear signal to the NORP that their attempts at a nuclear weapon will be met with resistance, unified resistance. The issue of proliferation is one where there is good cooperation between GPE and GPE. It is in the world's interest that GPE and GPE and other nations work together to stop proliferators from being able to get a hold of materials that could end up harming innocent people. We have worked with GPE on GPE. As you know, we spoke with CARDINAL voice to the leadership in GPE, that GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE strongly oppose their desire to have a weapons program. And hopefully, we can make progress. In other words, one should not be surprised that there are differences. And the fundamental question in world diplomacy is, how do you deal with the differences? Do you deal with them that ends up, hopefully, creating more opportunities for cooperation, or do you deal with them in such a way as it creates-it widens gulfs and creates more antagonisms? And my relationship with GPE is firm. I tell people what I believe based upon certain principles. But it is going to be in such a way that treats people with respect. I have noticed that PERSON has also had to deal with PERSON and has done so in a very respectful but firm way. And I admire the way she is handled her diplomacy. She has proven herself to be a very strong leader. And for that, I am grateful, and I hope the NORP people are as well. ENTITY, your administration, you just said, offers a lot to GPE to gain acceptance, GPE's acceptance to idea building--missile shield. And at the same time, so far, it does not seem that you offer much to GPE, which is supposed to host the interceptor site. How would you convince people in GPE, who are frankly not that much afraid of uranium threat, but they are listening to the threats from GPE very carefully? First of all, GPE and the GPE are in ORG, and an attack on one is an attack on all. We cannot offer any better security agreement than that, and we mean it. If you are an ally of GPE and ORG and you feel threatened by an outside force, we will help you. I do not believe that there would be-I would certainly hope that GPE will not be threatened again by an outside force. I can understand why people in GPE could be nervous about that. After all, it is been a terrible part of your history. But as an ally in ORG, I cannot make a stronger statement than to say we stand with you, and in this case, this ally actually means it, and so do ORG allies. You know, I am sure there is probably some skepticism from some older folks or those who study history, where GPE had been given assurances and those assurances did not come through. Well, in this case, they will. I do not view GPE as being under any military threat. Obviously, there are differences you have with GPE over meat, and I am very aware of that. It is an ORG matter; it is a matter that PERSON is working hard, as the head of the ORG at this point in time, to address that problem. The best way to compensate GPE for our friendship is to have good, strong bilateral relations. As you know, we have worked hard on different agreements that would help create jobs. It is really the best thing that a relationship can do, is yield tangible benefits for people besides peace and security. And job creation and decent-paying jobs benefit society as a whole. And we will keep it that way. I am sure I will be discussing that with the President. What are the values that you believe you share with this Pope? What common ground you may have with ORG on issues like GPE or GPE or GPE? The common values are respect for human life, human-and dignity. I think His Holy Father will be pleased to know that much of our foreign policy is based on the admonition, to whom much is given, much is required. I look forward to sharing with him our sincere desire to help alleviate poverty and hunger and disease. I will remind him-in FAC DATE, I talked about spending MONEY on our battle against HIV/AIDS, particularly on the continent of Africa. Our initiative is, thus far, a MONEY initiative over DATE, that is helped provide antiretroviral drugs for CARDINAL people in a DATE period, up from CARDINAL. Many of those folks who are helping to carry out that initiative are people from NORP charities or NORP congregations here in GPE. And I will tell him how proud I am of our NORP citizens who have volunteered, in many cases, to help relieve suffering around the world. I will also talk to him about our malaria initiative where we believe we will have gotten help to folks, particularly on the continent of Africa, in the form of nets and insecticides and medicines, to CARDINAL people. I will remind him that this commitment is real and sincere. I believe he believes-look, I do not want to put words in his mouth-I hope he believes in the universality of freedom because I certainly do. In other words, freedom is not just a Western ideal; it is just not the ideal that some people-it is universal in application. I will remind him of my firm belief that freedom is not only universal, but history has proven democracies tend not to war with each other and that the best way to yield the peace-something I long for-is to help people become free. I have read CARDINAL of his works, and I am looking forward to hearing this good, decent, honorable man share some thoughts with me. Just in terms of other issues, I will- if he cares to talk about GPE, I'd love to talk about GPE. We expect there to be elections and free press, free prisoners. You mentioned GPE; I will confirm our strong support for ORG. I am impressed by his courage. And I will explain to him that CARDINAL of the reasons why we felt like it was important to go through with the PERSON trial for the ORG was to enhance ORG. And it is to make it clear that there is been foreign interference in that country, and we expect that foreign interference to stop. I will tell him that there, too, we have got good relations, and I intend to keep them that way. Part of having good relations with a country is being in a position to talk about religious freedoms. I would remind him that I have been to church in GPE and actually found it to be a spiritual experience. But I will assure him that I will continue to make the case for ORG inside of GPE. CARDINAL of the things I do not know if he knows I know, but there has been an attempt to get a good interface between ORG and ORG so that eventually the prescribed leadership, NORP leadership, would be able to have an active role in GPE. So far, ORG has resisted this, but I have been in-received several entreaties from our NORP cardinals here on behalf of His Holy Father to reach out to the NORP. And if he cares, I will be glad to summarize those contacts with him. ENTITY, concerning the shield, the antimissile shield, I know GPE is one of the newest members of ORG. But as I know, the shield will not cover the southeastern part of ORG, including GPE. And there are NORP military facilities in this country, which makes some people nervous there. Are you planning to change the situation? The missile defense that we are talking about is primarily for the longer term missile. And you are right; that will not cover all of ORG. It will cover most of ORG. GPE will be covered by ORG missile defenses for intermediate-range missiles, and I will be glad to make that case. It is important for our ORG-when I am in GPE, it is important for our ORG allies not to feel like defenses apply to some but not everybody. And as you know, we are in discussions about access bases, which also, I would hope, would provide a sense of security. The first goal, of course, is to work with everybody in your neighborhood to try to convince them to be peaceful in the first place so that the defenses are not needed. And as you know, I am deeply concerned about GPE having a nuclear weapon that could fly toward Europe or, for that matter, toward any other allies. And we do not want to ever have ourselves in a position where the world could become blackmailed. And, therefore, CARDINAL way to deal with this issue is through a missile defense system. However, such a weapon, in this particular scenario, would not affect GPE; it would be a much smaller one for which we have different technologies, ORG technologies, available. Yes, you can call me ENTITY. You already told me that once. ENTITY, for better or worse, you undoubtedly changed modern history of this vote. I mean, are you happy with your decisions? Are you comfortable with your decisions? Are you listening to criticism around the world? Yes, PERSON, I hear what people say, and I am very comfortable with my decisions, absolutely. Our country came under attack, and I vowed to the NORP people I would do all in my power to protect it. And it is still under threat. And the best way to protect GPE is to stay on the offense and bring people to justice before they hurt us. we work with allies and friends, and we share intelligence. We help cut off money; we disrupt, jointly-- I also knew that we had to deal with threats before they came to hurt us, whether it be in GPE and GPE; I made the right decisions. And I believe it is in all our interests that these democracies survive. In some cases, GPE and GPE, in some cases, only GPE; either case, they are very important. If democracies cannot help other democracies, then I worry about stability and peace in the long run. Matter of fact, I was amazed by-he asked, do I feel abandoned? I feel that we are in this long-term struggle with a lot of strong allies-a lot. There is a lot of people in GPE that committed resources and manpower and effort. A lot of people in GPE, all the ORG countries have got manpower there, plus a lot of other countries. And, you know, you have got to work at them. I constantly remind people there is a threat. My roommate in college was PERSON. He was from GPE, though. ENTITY, in the run-up to the ORG meeting, our energy-our climate change turnout will be a divisive issue, at least to the NORP press. Does it help to bridge the gap between the GPE position and the NORP position, which includes firm mandatory caps on greenhouse gases? Or have you basically preempted ORG? No, look, first of all, your opening question was, the NORP press is looking for conflict. Is that what you said? I do not want to misquote you. I think, look, if people want to try to figure out a way to be divisive, they will try to create divisions. I do not view it that way. I view this as an effort by concerned nations to reach common accord to actually solve the problem. We will take the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases and come up with an international goal. And I suggested, here is CARDINAL way to deal with the PERSON world. First thing that the Chancellor wanted to know is, did I agree there ought to be a PERSON framework. That is the threshold question, because if it is no, then we can end the conversation; if it is yes, then what are your suggestions? And I believe PERSON will be pleased with that because she is-this was something she was working toward. How we arrive at that goal is-I set out a process where greenhouse gas emitters, including developing nations, ought to be at the table. As you know full well, that one could have a very strict regime on greenhouse gases, but if nothing were done with countries like GPE or GPE, all would be for naught. So I thought it made sense to include a variety of nations that are actually producing greenhouse gases, including GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE and the ORG and others. Thirdly, I said that each nation needs to come up with an interim goal and develop the methodology to achieve that goal. Now, I said this in FAC, next to the Chancellor and PERSON, that each country has got to develop a plan that suits its own economy and suits its own political environment. If you want the GPE to be an active participant, that is the best way to do it as well. A lot of people do not particularly want our environmental policy written by somebody else. They think we ought to be writing our own environmental policy, in this case, to achieve international goals. I am looking forward to it. CARDINAL, energy independent; CARDINAL, economic vitality and growth. And as an active trading partner with GPE, you would want us to be economically strong. And finally, a strong steward of the environment, and technology is going to lead us there. And I look forward to explaining some of the technological breakthroughs that we have achieved and will achieve. You probably do not know this, but we are up to QUANTITY of corn ethanol now being used in our cars. Over DATE, PERCENT of every automobile in GPE will be flex-fuel. In other words, you can either use ethanol or gasoline; your choice. But we are spending MONEY-or MONEY, MONEY, on coming up with the ability to break down different forms of feedstocks to produce ethanol. That is called cellulosic ethanol, like switchgrasses or wood chips. Would not it be remarkable when we have a breakthrough to develop fuel to run our automobiles from wood chips? You got a lot of wood in GPE. I'd be glad to share that technology with you. We will have a mandatory fuel standard that will reduce our gasoline consumption by PERCENT over DATE. No President has ever said that. I happen to believe that there is going to be some significant battery technology breakthroughs as well, and I look forward to sharing that with our partners. Matter of fact, the NORP are spending a lot of money on battery technologies, and it is very conceivable one day we will be having hybrid plug-in battery-driven vehicles with a regular-sized automobile. You can do it with a golf cart now, but on a lot of our freeways, it would be dangerous--yours too. The fundamental question facing GPE is, how fast can we develop CARDINAL-emission coal-fired electricity plants? And we are spending a lot of money there, and we look forward to sharing technologies with our allies and friends and people who need help. And so we have got a very strong agenda that I am looking forward to sharing in ORG. And one of the things I am going to do is encourage others to step up to the research and development arena. They ought to be spending as much as we are. And then we ought to be willing to share that technology with developing countries. And finally, if you are really interested in solving greenhouse gases and making sure your economy grows, you ought to be for civilian nuclear power, And we are spending-we are advancing an interesting initiative with GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE on coming up with new technologies on fast-burner reactors in order to be able to deal with the waste issue. Anyway, there is a lot to talk about, and so I am looking forward to it. just like feeding the hungry is important; just like solving HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa is important; just like dealing with malaria is important; just like poor children, particularly women, girls, getting an education is important. These are all important initiatives, and I cannot wait to discuss them there. Last time you were in Eastern Europe, DATE in GPE and GPE, you promised changes in visa regime for your close allies. I promised I would work on it. ENTITY, make sure you quote me correctly. Yes, let me talk about it. It affects GPE, it affects GPE, and it affects GPE. I fully understand the frustrations of countries and people of countries who have supported friendship with GPE. And they look at neighbors in the ORG or ORG and say, wait TIME; we are treated differently. I understand that. This is an issue that your leaders have spoken very candidly with me. And I told them I did not -I thought it was unfair that the NORP citizen be given a type of visa and not the NORP citizen. And we are working closely with ORG to change long-standing law. First of all, we set up a way forward, a roadmap to visa changes. And I said I would work with our ORG to come up with a fair law that treated people fairly. We have yet to pass the law, but we are working with ORG. There is, as you may or may not know, a healthy immigration debate taking place in GPE. I am a big proponent of what we call comprehensive immigration reform, as I am a proponent of visa reform, visa waiver reform. I cannot give you a firm prediction as to exactly when this will emerge from ORG, but we are working hard to see if we cannot get it done. ENTITY, you said that you hope that your arrival will boost Mr. PERSON's energy on GPE. No, let me rephrase that. Can I restate that? I do not want to boost his energy. I do want to sit down and talk to him about how important the NORP commitment is to GPE and its future, is really what I meant to say. And that was what my question was about. What would you like GPE to do in GPE and, more in general, in the war on terror? How do you see GPE as a global partner on this issue? And, also, if you can spend a few words on the protesters that will receive you in GPE. I am going to meet some protesters in GPE again? They declared DATE. First of all, when you go to free societies, you tend to see protesters. Freedom of speech, that is what we are talking about. I presume there is going to be a few in GPE, just like there were-listen, when world leaders get together, or a leader shows up that people pay attention to, people get on TV by protesting. They have got different causes, and they want to express themselves. And I welcome going to a society where people are free to speak. It is a sign of a robust society. We had a few, one time, in GPE, if you remember. And the other question was about GPE, GPE's role in GPE. First of all, commitment to GPE, itself, helps. We want to help you; we know you are struggling. And it encourages people. The idea of saying we are a robust, free society, and we want to stand with you as you try to develop your own society in your own image is important to the psychology of the country. police training, judicial training. And in the war on terror, the idea of sharing intelligence when we find it, it is in both our interests. If we know somebody is plotting and planning in GPE, we will share that information, and vice versa. And that is really what matters, is the ability to talk to each other in such a way that if we have information that is beneficial for one or the other, we are comfortable enough of sharing that information so we can protect ourselves. Make no mistake about it, the enemy wants to strike again. These are ideologues who have got ambitions, and it is very important that we all take them seriously. the commitment to work together, the commitment to watch their finances, the commitment to understand what they are thinking and what they are doing. And they will kill you like that, in order to achieve their objectives; make no mistake about it. And the temptation is to say, oh, no, it is just a couple of guys that are not that dangerous. They are dangerous, and I will remind our friends. GPE has been a strong partner in a lot of areas, and I appreciate it. Back to GPE-you know that sometimes you spoke about the energy and energy security. Sometimes energy is used as a political tool, especially if there is a sense of-in Eastern Europe that GPE is using its oil and gas as a political tool. Do you have any leverage on GPE and the GPE in this field of energy security? And very crucial events happened during both your terms, and crucial decisions were taken here in this building. What world and what future for this great country do you envision in DATE? I do have, I do not know, DATE? First thing you have got to know about me is, I am going to sprint to the finish. I have got a lot to do, and I am going to work as hard as I can to get it done. You have heard me talk about a lot of issues. We have got an engagement in GPE and GPE, on HIV/AIDS and feeding the hungry and dealing with proliferation, and working on the environment. I believe people ought to have more money in their pocket; that is how you grow your economies. We are talking about health care, a big education reform, and immigration reform. There is a lot to do, and I do not have that much time to think beyond my Presidency. I am occupied with the moment. That is the way-I will put a lot of energy into the final 18 months and give it my all. That is all you can do in life is give it your best. That is what I am going to do. I owe that to the NORP people. My concern for GPE is that we never become an isolationist nation or a protectionist nation. We have had those tendencies in the past. I am not suggesting that is where we are, but I am worried that that might happen at some point in time. Or, It is too difficult to fight the terrorists. Or, It is too difficult to help advance democracy; let us just kind of retreat. I think it would be a huge mistake for GPE. I would hope that DATE GPE still works with other nations to advance liberty. I remind people about my NORP friend Prime Minister PERSON, now Prime Minister PERSON, PERSON, a good guy. Is not it interesting that the GPE President sits at the table with the NORP Prime Minister to talk about peace, and my father fought them, and they were the sworn enemy? And now we are working together on peace. Liberty has got an amazing way of transforming enemies into friends-same in GPE, in many ways. I would hope GPE would never lose sight of that capacity. You have got your worries about supplies of energy, and so do I- where we get our energy from. If you are interested in reducing dependence on crude oil, then what you do is develop different ways to power your automobiles. And so we are using corn to power our automobiles. That way we do not have to use gasoline and therefore use crude oil as a feedstock. My goal is to make us nearly totally independent from foreign sources of oil. And that ought to be the goal of a nation that worries from sole-source supplier, that you ought to figure out different ways to do it. How do you do it? Well, you can do it through nuclear technology, for example; as opposed to using natural gas to power your electricity, use nuclear technology. Hopefully, we can come with clean coal technologies so that you can burn coal. We need to do it in GPE. We have got DATE of coal supply. Coal is a particular problem when it comes to pollution; we know that. We spent MONEY on your ORG plant, clean coal technologies. We believe that we will be able to develop a coal-fired plant that has CARDINAL emissions. And when that technology comes to fruition, if you can get yourself some coal, you have got your ability to diversify away from sole-source supplier of energy. And that is what technology is going to yield. I truly believe over DATE, you are going to see some amazing technological breakthroughs. And I believe and hope that those technological breakthroughs will make a lot of the discussions we are having here at DATE moot, relative to energy security and environmental quality. I believe some of the discussions I have had with you about battery technologies will be real. We are spending MONEY on hydrogen technologies. We believe that cars will be powered by hydrogen, which will obviously relieve pressure on crude oil dependence. The emissions of hydrogen-driven automobiles is going to be driblets of water, which will be good for the environment. And you know, I would hope that mankind does not lose faith in the capacity of technology to transform the way we live in positive ways. Here in GPE, what is interesting is to watch some of the investment flows of private capital. We are a system based upon private capital. And so I talked about, in my speech DATE, about public capital investment, public tax dollars going into research and development, MONEY over DATE that I have been President. But there is enormous sums of money going into the private markets as well, because people see economic opportunity can be derived by new energy technologies. And it is that synergy to be derived from public participation and public policy, the declaration of a mandatory fuel standard coupled with private sector investments that could yield breakthroughs. I like the idea that the NORP are pushing hard for battery technologies. I want our people pushing hard for battery technologies. It yields better product for consumers. It makes us all work more efficiently and wiser in the end. And I am excited to be a part of it. I have got DATE to be a part of it here in this capacity, and it is going to be DATE.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists7", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-journalists-7", "publication_date": "31-05-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 11, "text": "First, I am really looking forward to the trip. It is a chance for me to see old friends, make new friends, and talk about an agenda that is based upon freedom and the obligation, for those of us who benefit from our free societies, to help less fortunate people. Obviously, the ORG is going to be the center point of the visit; it will be where the most focus is. But I take my bilateral visits very seriously. We are starting in GPE. I am looking forward to seeing the President and the Prime Minister. Besides my bilateral meetings with the leadership, I am looking forward to my democracy speech. PERSON has asked me to come and speak to a democracy forum. I feel very strongly that GPE must take the lead in promoting democracy around the world-even in places where it may not look like it could-that it is very hospitable because I believe, ultimately, it is hospitable. And so it is going to be an important speech, and I am working on it. And then, of course, I go to GPE for ORG I have been in that beautiful part of your country before. I am looking forward to the seaside resort. Of course, I am anxious to see the Chancellor. She and I have got a very strong relationship. I do not know if you know this or not, but we do visit via secure video on a fairly regular basis. I have had some-you know, a lot of meaningful conversations with her, other than by phone. And DATE I will be talking about the need for all of us to work together to deal with HIV/AIDS and malaria and education. And, of course, global climate change will be an issue as well. And then we will go on to GPE. I am looking forward to going back-for my third time; twice in GPE, third time in GPE. Of course, part of the discussions with both countries will be on missile defense. I will be glad to answer any questions you have on that. It is just an important issue for us to discuss, and it is an important for me to allay people's fears. My friend PERSON is making this to be a case where somehow this is going to jeopardize relations in Europe, and it is going to make the world a more dangerous place-quite the opposite. The reason one advocates and works for a missile defense system is to protect free peoples from the launch of a missile from a hostile regime. We do not agree with GPE all the time, but nevertheless, I view them as a friendly nation, not a hostile nation. And I will work with PERSON not only at ORG but when he comes to visit up east here. But I know that is going to be part of our conversation. By the way, in the case of GPE, GPE, GPE, and, to a certain extent, GPE, and definitely GPE, there is a lot of obviously, you know, NORP who are very interested in this trip. NORP are-there is a lot of them, and they really love their country of origin, their grandfathers' country of origin. And this is an important trip symbolically, as well, to see their NORP President in GPE-or in GPE, a lot of NORP are very proud of their heritage as well. So the trip obviously is the chance to visit on important issues, whether it be GPE or GPE, where these countries are supportive, as well as their common interests in bilateral issues. I am looking forward to CARDINAL things in GPE, obviously seeing His Holy Father. Sometimes I am not poetic enough to describe what it is like to be in the presence of the Holy Father. And I have not been in the presence of this particular Holy Father. Obviously, CARDINAL visits with the last great man, and I am looking forward to this. I am looking forward to hearing him. I will be in a listening mode. And then Prime Minister PERSON, with whom I have had a long relationship. I knew him when he was the head of the ORG. I can remember, fondly remember riding my mountain bike as hard as I could as he was jogging along the beaches in GPE, needling him on the way by-a sign of close friendship. We have got a good relationship. He is having to make difficult decisions in GPE, and I hope my visit will help boost his courage in doing the right thing in GPE. And then, of course, GPE-I am looking forward to that as well. I am looking forward to seeing the leadership there. GPE has made some very difficult decisions, but necessary decisions. It is going to be-I love going to countries that may not expect to see the GPE President. It is pretty predictable that the President would go to GPE or GPE, probably GPE and GPE, but not necessarily GPE and GPE. And it is going to be a great honor for me to be in your country. I am looking forward to it. I am excited about the trip. I gave a speech DATE. I do not know if you suffered through it or not, but it is -anyway, I was proud to give it, and I meant what I said. And we have got a darn good record, and I am going to be taking that record, on behalf of the NORP people, to ORG and hoping to encourage others to match it. You can call me ORG. Now, given his angry response to missile defense, do you regret choosing GPE and GPE as possible sites for the missile defense? The reason this country has been chosen is because it will make the missile defense system more effective as we provide defenses for most of our ORG allies. Did he disappoint you? He is a-he is concerned about the missile defense system. He thinks it is aimed at him. It is aimed at rogue regimes that would use a missile to achieve political objective or to create unrest. And therefore, I sent Secretary PERSON to see the leadership, the NORP leadership, to explain our intentions. We have invited the NORP to participate, totally transparent-- We are totally transparent in our designs. We want them to see our technologies. PERSON was very instrumental in us reaching out to the NORP; she was deeply concerned about the ramifications of this decision. Secondly, it is-I repeat, we have nothing to hide. PERSON said, you know, this kind of rhetoric is the kind of rhetoric that relives the cold war. We are now into DATE, where we need to deal with the true threats, which are threats of radical extremists who will kill to advance an ideology and the threats of proliferation. And there is a lot of work we can do together to deal with these threats. And that is what I will continue talking to President PERSON about. Yes, it has. What needs to be done to avoid this relationship to degenerate further into a deep and lasting crisis? And in general, on that note, you set up the conversation. For the GPE cannot speak for the GPE-Russian relationship; that is recently where there is been some tension, as you noted, for the GPE relationship. It is a complex relationship where we have got some areas of agreement and some areas of disagreement. We believe strongly in democracy. PERSON will tell me that GPE is a democracy and that he is advancing democracy. We have got some questions about that, of course. We believe that actions taken in GPE, for example-in relation to the actions taken in GPE were-it sent a confusing signal to us. We obviously have got a difficult issue with GPE. We believe we ought to advance the PERSON agreement through ORG. But disagreement on issues does not mean that the relations are not cordial. As a matter of fact, I have found that it is easier to disagree on issues when you have a cordial relationship. It means you can discuss your differences without hostility, which makes it easier that you can find common ground. And we have common ground with GPE on matters like GPE. We have worked closely with GPE in ORG to send a clear signal to the NORP that their attempts at a nuclear weapon will be met with resistance, unified resistance. The issue of proliferation is one where there is good cooperation between GPE and GPE. It is in the world's interest that GPE and GPE and other nations work together to stop proliferators from being able to get a hold of materials that could end up harming innocent people. We have worked with GPE on GPE. As you know, we spoke with CARDINAL voice to the leadership in GPE, that GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE strongly oppose their desire to have a weapons program. And hopefully, we can make progress. In other words, one should not be surprised that there are differences. And the fundamental question in world diplomacy is, how do you deal with the differences? Do you deal with them that ends up, hopefully, creating more opportunities for cooperation, or do you deal with them in such a way as it creates-it widens gulfs and creates more antagonisms? And my relationship with GPE is firm. I tell people what I believe based upon certain principles. But it is going to be in such a way that treats people with respect. I have noticed that PERSON has also had to deal with PERSON and has done so in a very respectful but firm way. And I admire the way she is handled her diplomacy. She has proven herself to be a very strong leader. And for that, I am grateful, and I hope the NORP people are as well. ENTITY, your administration, you just said, offers a lot to GPE to gain acceptance, GPE's acceptance to idea building--missile shield. And at the same time, so far, it does not seem that you offer much to GPE, which is supposed to host the interceptor site. How would you convince people in GPE, who are frankly not that much afraid of uranium threat, but they are listening to the threats from GPE very carefully? First of all, GPE and the GPE are in ORG, and an attack on one is an attack on all. We cannot offer any better security agreement than that, and we mean it. If you are an ally of GPE and ORG and you feel threatened by an outside force, we will help you. I do not believe that there would be-I would certainly hope that GPE will not be threatened again by an outside force. I can understand why people in GPE could be nervous about that. After all, it is been a terrible part of your history. But as an ally in ORG, I cannot make a stronger statement than to say we stand with you, and in this case, this ally actually means it, and so do ORG allies. You know, I am sure there is probably some skepticism from some older folks or those who study history, where GPE had been given assurances and those assurances did not come through. Well, in this case, they will. I do not view GPE as being under any military threat. Obviously, there are differences you have with GPE over meat, and I am very aware of that. It is an ORG matter; it is a matter that PERSON is working hard, as the head of the ORG at this point in time, to address that problem. The best way to compensate GPE for our friendship is to have good, strong bilateral relations. As you know, we have worked hard on different agreements that would help create jobs. It is really the best thing that a relationship can do, is yield tangible benefits for people besides peace and security. And job creation and decent-paying jobs benefit society as a whole. And we will keep it that way. I am sure I will be discussing that with the President. What are the values that you believe you share with this Pope? What common ground you may have with ORG on issues like GPE or GPE or GPE? The common values are respect for human life, human-and dignity. I think His Holy Father will be pleased to know that much of our foreign policy is based on the admonition, to whom much is given, much is required. I look forward to sharing with him our sincere desire to help alleviate poverty and hunger and disease. I will remind him-in FAC DATE, I talked about spending MONEY on our battle against HIV/AIDS, particularly on the continent of Africa. Our initiative is, thus far, a MONEY initiative over DATE, that is helped provide antiretroviral drugs for CARDINAL people in a DATE period, up from CARDINAL. Many of those folks who are helping to carry out that initiative are people from NORP charities or NORP congregations here in GPE. And I will tell him how proud I am of our NORP citizens who have volunteered, in many cases, to help relieve suffering around the world. I will also talk to him about our malaria initiative where we believe we will have gotten help to folks, particularly on the continent of Africa, in the form of nets and insecticides and medicines, to CARDINAL people. I will remind him that this commitment is real and sincere. I believe he believes-look, I do not want to put words in his mouth-I hope he believes in the universality of freedom because I certainly do. In other words, freedom is not just a Western ideal; it is just not the ideal that some people-it is universal in application. I will remind him of my firm belief that freedom is not only universal, but history has proven democracies tend not to war with each other and that the best way to yield the peace-something I long for-is to help people become free. I have read CARDINAL of his works, and I am looking forward to hearing this good, decent, honorable man share some thoughts with me. Just in terms of other issues, I will- if he cares to talk about GPE, I'd love to talk about GPE. We expect there to be elections and free press, free prisoners. You mentioned GPE; I will confirm our strong support for ORG. I am impressed by his courage. And I will explain to him that CARDINAL of the reasons why we felt like it was important to go through with the PERSON trial for the ORG was to enhance ORG. And it is to make it clear that there is been foreign interference in that country, and we expect that foreign interference to stop. I will tell him that there, too, we have got good relations, and I intend to keep them that way. Part of having good relations with a country is being in a position to talk about religious freedoms. I would remind him that I have been to church in GPE and actually found it to be a spiritual experience. But I will assure him that I will continue to make the case for ORG inside of GPE. CARDINAL of the things I do not know if he knows I know, but there has been an attempt to get a good interface between ORG and ORG so that eventually the prescribed leadership, NORP leadership, would be able to have an active role in GPE. So far, ORG has resisted this, but I have been in-received several entreaties from our NORP cardinals here on behalf of His Holy Father to reach out to the NORP. And if he cares, I will be glad to summarize those contacts with him. ENTITY, concerning the shield, the antimissile shield, I know GPE is one of the newest members of ORG. But as I know, the shield will not cover the southeastern part of ORG, including GPE. And there are NORP military facilities in this country, which makes some people nervous there. Are you planning to change the situation? The missile defense that we are talking about is primarily for the longer term missile. And you are right; that will not cover all of ORG. It will cover most of ORG. GPE will be covered by ORG missile defenses for intermediate-range missiles, and I will be glad to make that case. It is important for our ORG-when I am in GPE, it is important for our ORG allies not to feel like defenses apply to some but not everybody. And as you know, we are in discussions about access bases, which also, I would hope, would provide a sense of security. The first goal, of course, is to work with everybody in your neighborhood to try to convince them to be peaceful in the first place so that the defenses are not needed. And as you know, I am deeply concerned about GPE having a nuclear weapon that could fly toward Europe or, for that matter, toward any other allies. And we do not want to ever have ourselves in a position where the world could become blackmailed. And, therefore, CARDINAL way to deal with this issue is through a missile defense system. However, such a weapon, in this particular scenario, would not affect GPE; it would be a much smaller one for which we have different technologies, ORG technologies, available. Yes, you can call me ENTITY. You already told me that once. ENTITY, for better or worse, you undoubtedly changed modern history of this vote. I mean, are you happy with your decisions? Are you comfortable with your decisions? Are you listening to criticism around the world? Yes, PERSON, I hear what people say, and I am very comfortable with my decisions, absolutely. Our country came under attack, and I vowed to the NORP people I would do all in my power to protect it. And it is still under threat. And the best way to protect GPE is to stay on the offense and bring people to justice before they hurt us. we work with allies and friends, and we share intelligence. We help cut off money; we disrupt, jointly-- I also knew that we had to deal with threats before they came to hurt us, whether it be in GPE and GPE; I made the right decisions. And I believe it is in all our interests that these democracies survive. In some cases, GPE and GPE, in some cases, only GPE; either case, they are very important. If democracies cannot help other democracies, then I worry about stability and peace in the long run. Matter of fact, I was amazed by-he asked, do I feel abandoned? I feel that we are in this long-term struggle with a lot of strong allies-a lot. There is a lot of people in GPE that committed resources and manpower and effort. A lot of people in GPE, all the ORG countries have got manpower there, plus a lot of other countries. And, you know, you have got to work at them. I constantly remind people there is a threat. My roommate in college was PERSON. He was from GPE, though. ENTITY, in the run-up to the ORG meeting, our energy-our climate change turnout will be a divisive issue, at least to the NORP press. Does it help to bridge the gap between the GPE position and the NORP position, which includes firm mandatory caps on greenhouse gases? Or have you basically preempted ORG? No, look, first of all, your opening question was, the NORP press is looking for conflict. Is that what you said? I do not want to misquote you. I think, look, if people want to try to figure out a way to be divisive, they will try to create divisions. I do not view it that way. I view this as an effort by concerned nations to reach common accord to actually solve the problem. We will take the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases and come up with an international goal. And I suggested, here is CARDINAL way to deal with the PERSON world. First thing that the Chancellor wanted to know is, did I agree there ought to be a PERSON framework. That is the threshold question, because if it is no, then we can end the conversation; if it is yes, then what are your suggestions? And I believe PERSON will be pleased with that because she is-this was something she was working toward. How we arrive at that goal is-I set out a process where greenhouse gas emitters, including developing nations, ought to be at the table. As you know full well, that one could have a very strict regime on greenhouse gases, but if nothing were done with countries like GPE or GPE, all would be for naught. So I thought it made sense to include a variety of nations that are actually producing greenhouse gases, including GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE and the ORG and others. Thirdly, I said that each nation needs to come up with an interim goal and develop the methodology to achieve that goal. Now, I said this in FAC, next to the Chancellor and PERSON, that each country has got to develop a plan that suits its own economy and suits its own political environment. If you want the GPE to be an active participant, that is the best way to do it as well. A lot of people do not particularly want our environmental policy written by somebody else. They think we ought to be writing our own environmental policy, in this case, to achieve international goals. I am looking forward to it. CARDINAL, energy independent; CARDINAL, economic vitality and growth. And as an active trading partner with GPE, you would want us to be economically strong. And finally, a strong steward of the environment, and technology is going to lead us there. And I look forward to explaining some of the technological breakthroughs that we have achieved and will achieve. You probably do not know this, but we are up to QUANTITY of corn ethanol now being used in our cars. Over DATE, PERCENT of every automobile in GPE will be flex-fuel. In other words, you can either use ethanol or gasoline; your choice. But we are spending MONEY-or MONEY, MONEY, on coming up with the ability to break down different forms of feedstocks to produce ethanol. That is called cellulosic ethanol, like switchgrasses or wood chips. Would not it be remarkable when we have a breakthrough to develop fuel to run our automobiles from wood chips? You got a lot of wood in GPE. I'd be glad to share that technology with you. We will have a mandatory fuel standard that will reduce our gasoline consumption by PERCENT over DATE. No President has ever said that. I happen to believe that there is going to be some significant battery technology breakthroughs as well, and I look forward to sharing that with our partners. Matter of fact, the NORP are spending a lot of money on battery technologies, and it is very conceivable one day we will be having hybrid plug-in battery-driven vehicles with a regular-sized automobile. You can do it with a golf cart now, but on a lot of our freeways, it would be dangerous--yours too. The fundamental question facing GPE is, how fast can we develop CARDINAL-emission coal-fired electricity plants? And we are spending a lot of money there, and we look forward to sharing technologies with our allies and friends and people who need help. And so we have got a very strong agenda that I am looking forward to sharing in ORG. And one of the things I am going to do is encourage others to step up to the research and development arena. They ought to be spending as much as we are. And then we ought to be willing to share that technology with developing countries. And finally, if you are really interested in solving greenhouse gases and making sure your economy grows, you ought to be for civilian nuclear power, And we are spending-we are advancing an interesting initiative with GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE on coming up with new technologies on fast-burner reactors in order to be able to deal with the waste issue. Anyway, there is a lot to talk about, and so I am looking forward to it. just like feeding the hungry is important; just like solving HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa is important; just like dealing with malaria is important; just like poor children, particularly women, girls, getting an education is important. These are all important initiatives, and I cannot wait to discuss them there. Last time you were in Eastern Europe, DATE in GPE and GPE, you promised changes in visa regime for your close allies. I promised I would work on it. ENTITY, make sure you quote me correctly. Yes, let me talk about it. It affects GPE, it affects GPE, and it affects GPE. I fully understand the frustrations of countries and people of countries who have supported friendship with GPE. And they look at neighbors in the ORG or ORG and say, wait TIME; we are treated differently. I understand that. This is an issue that your leaders have spoken very candidly with me. And I told them I did not -I thought it was unfair that the NORP citizen be given a type of visa and not the NORP citizen. And we are working closely with ORG to change long-standing law. First of all, we set up a way forward, a roadmap to visa changes. And I said I would work with our ORG to come up with a fair law that treated people fairly. We have yet to pass the law, but we are working with ORG. There is, as you may or may not know, a healthy immigration debate taking place in GPE. I am a big proponent of what we call comprehensive immigration reform, as I am a proponent of visa reform, visa waiver reform. I cannot give you a firm prediction as to exactly when this will emerge from ORG, but we are working hard to see if we cannot get it done. ENTITY, you said that you hope that your arrival will boost Mr. PERSON's energy on GPE. No, let me rephrase that. Can I restate that? I do not want to boost his energy. I do want to sit down and talk to him about how important the NORP commitment is to GPE and its future, is really what I meant to say. And that was what my question was about. What would you like GPE to do in GPE and, more in general, in the war on terror? How do you see GPE as a global partner on this issue? And, also, if you can spend a few words on the protesters that will receive you in GPE. I am going to meet some protesters in GPE again? They declared DATE. First of all, when you go to free societies, you tend to see protesters. Freedom of speech, that is what we are talking about. I presume there is going to be a few in GPE, just like there were-listen, when world leaders get together, or a leader shows up that people pay attention to, people get on TV by protesting. They have got different causes, and they want to express themselves. And I welcome going to a society where people are free to speak. It is a sign of a robust society. We had a few, one time, in GPE, if you remember. And the other question was about GPE, GPE's role in GPE. First of all, commitment to GPE, itself, helps. We want to help you; we know you are struggling. And it encourages people. The idea of saying we are a robust, free society, and we want to stand with you as you try to develop your own society in your own image is important to the psychology of the country. police training, judicial training. And in the war on terror, the idea of sharing intelligence when we find it, it is in both our interests. If we know somebody is plotting and planning in GPE, we will share that information, and vice versa. And that is really what matters, is the ability to talk to each other in such a way that if we have information that is beneficial for one or the other, we are comfortable enough of sharing that information so we can protect ourselves. Make no mistake about it, the enemy wants to strike again. These are ideologues who have got ambitions, and it is very important that we all take them seriously. the commitment to work together, the commitment to watch their finances, the commitment to understand what they are thinking and what they are doing. And they will kill you like that, in order to achieve their objectives; make no mistake about it. And the temptation is to say, oh, no, it is just a couple of guys that are not that dangerous. They are dangerous, and I will remind our friends. GPE has been a strong partner in a lot of areas, and I appreciate it. Back to GPE-you know that sometimes you spoke about the energy and energy security. Sometimes energy is used as a political tool, especially if there is a sense of-in Eastern Europe that GPE is using its oil and gas as a political tool. Do you have any leverage on GPE and the GPE in this field of energy security? And very crucial events happened during both your terms, and crucial decisions were taken here in this building. What world and what future for this great country do you envision in DATE? I do have, I do not know, DATE? First thing you have got to know about me is, I am going to sprint to the finish. I have got a lot to do, and I am going to work as hard as I can to get it done. You have heard me talk about a lot of issues. We have got an engagement in GPE and GPE, on HIV/AIDS and feeding the hungry and dealing with proliferation, and working on the environment. I believe people ought to have more money in their pocket; that is how you grow your economies. We are talking about health care, a big education reform, and immigration reform. There is a lot to do, and I do not have that much time to think beyond my Presidency. I am occupied with the moment. That is the way-I will put a lot of energy into the final 18 months and give it my all. That is all you can do in life is give it your best. That is what I am going to do. I owe that to the NORP people. My concern for GPE is that we never become an isolationist nation or a protectionist nation. We have had those tendencies in the past. I am not suggesting that is where we are, but I am worried that that might happen at some point in time. Or, It is too difficult to fight the terrorists. Or, It is too difficult to help advance democracy; let us just kind of retreat. I think it would be a huge mistake for GPE. I would hope that DATE GPE still works with other nations to advance liberty. I remind people about my NORP friend Prime Minister PERSON, now Prime Minister PERSON, PERSON, a good guy. Is not it interesting that the GPE President sits at the table with the NORP Prime Minister to talk about peace, and my father fought them, and they were the sworn enemy? And now we are working together on peace. Liberty has got an amazing way of transforming enemies into friends-same in GPE, in many ways. I would hope GPE would never lose sight of that capacity. You have got your worries about supplies of energy, and so do I- where we get our energy from. If you are interested in reducing dependence on crude oil, then what you do is develop different ways to power your automobiles. And so we are using corn to power our automobiles. That way we do not have to use gasoline and therefore use crude oil as a feedstock. My goal is to make us nearly totally independent from foreign sources of oil. And that ought to be the goal of a nation that worries from sole-source supplier, that you ought to figure out different ways to do it. How do you do it? Well, you can do it through nuclear technology, for example; as opposed to using natural gas to power your electricity, use nuclear technology. Hopefully, we can come with clean coal technologies so that you can burn coal. We need to do it in GPE. We have got DATE of coal supply. Coal is a particular problem when it comes to pollution; we know that. We spent MONEY on your ORG plant, clean coal technologies. We believe that we will be able to develop a coal-fired plant that has CARDINAL emissions. And when that technology comes to fruition, if you can get yourself some coal, you have got your ability to diversify away from sole-source supplier of energy. And that is what technology is going to yield. I truly believe over DATE, you are going to see some amazing technological breakthroughs. And I believe and hope that those technological breakthroughs will make a lot of the discussions we are having here at DATE moot, relative to energy security and environmental quality. I believe some of the discussions I have had with you about battery technologies will be real. We are spending MONEY on hydrogen technologies. We believe that cars will be powered by hydrogen, which will obviously relieve pressure on crude oil dependence. The emissions of hydrogen-driven automobiles is going to be driblets of water, which will be good for the environment. And you know, I would hope that mankind does not lose faith in the capacity of technology to transform the way we live in positive ways. Here in GPE, what is interesting is to watch some of the investment flows of private capital. We are a system based upon private capital. And so I talked about, in my speech DATE, about public capital investment, public tax dollars going into research and development, MONEY over DATE that I have been President. But there is enormous sums of money going into the private markets as well, because people see economic opportunity can be derived by new energy technologies. And it is that synergy to be derived from public participation and public policy, the declaration of a mandatory fuel standard coupled with private sector investments that could yield breakthroughs. I like the idea that the NORP are pushing hard for battery technologies. I want our people pushing hard for battery technologies. It yields better product for consumers. It makes us all work more efficiently and wiser in the end. And I am excited to be a part of it. I have got DATE to be a part of it here in this capacity, and it is going to be DATE.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists7", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-journalists-7", "publication_date": "31-05-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 11, "text": "First, I am really looking forward to the trip. It is a chance for me to see old friends, make new friends, and talk about an agenda that is based upon freedom and the obligation, for those of us who benefit from our free societies, to help less fortunate people. Obviously, the ORG is going to be the center point of the visit; it will be where the most focus is. But I take my bilateral visits very seriously. We are starting in GPE. I am looking forward to seeing the President and the Prime Minister. Besides my bilateral meetings with the leadership, I am looking forward to my democracy speech. PERSON has asked me to come and speak to a democracy forum. I feel very strongly that GPE must take the lead in promoting democracy around the world-even in places where it may not look like it could-that it is very hospitable because I believe, ultimately, it is hospitable. And so it is going to be an important speech, and I am working on it. And then, of course, I go to GPE for ORG I have been in that beautiful part of your country before. I am looking forward to the seaside resort. Of course, I am anxious to see the Chancellor. She and I have got a very strong relationship. I do not know if you know this or not, but we do visit via secure video on a fairly regular basis. I have had some-you know, a lot of meaningful conversations with her, other than by phone. And DATE I will be talking about the need for all of us to work together to deal with HIV/AIDS and malaria and education. And, of course, global climate change will be an issue as well. And then we will go on to GPE. I am looking forward to going back-for my third time; twice in GPE, third time in GPE. Of course, part of the discussions with both countries will be on missile defense. I will be glad to answer any questions you have on that. It is just an important issue for us to discuss, and it is an important for me to allay people's fears. My friend PERSON is making this to be a case where somehow this is going to jeopardize relations in Europe, and it is going to make the world a more dangerous place-quite the opposite. The reason one advocates and works for a missile defense system is to protect free peoples from the launch of a missile from a hostile regime. We do not agree with GPE all the time, but nevertheless, I view them as a friendly nation, not a hostile nation. And I will work with PERSON not only at ORG but when he comes to visit up east here. But I know that is going to be part of our conversation. By the way, in the case of GPE, GPE, GPE, and, to a certain extent, GPE, and definitely GPE, there is a lot of obviously, you know, NORP who are very interested in this trip. NORP are-there is a lot of them, and they really love their country of origin, their grandfathers' country of origin. And this is an important trip symbolically, as well, to see their NORP President in GPE-or in GPE, a lot of NORP are very proud of their heritage as well. So the trip obviously is the chance to visit on important issues, whether it be GPE or GPE, where these countries are supportive, as well as their common interests in bilateral issues. I am looking forward to CARDINAL things in GPE, obviously seeing His Holy Father. Sometimes I am not poetic enough to describe what it is like to be in the presence of the Holy Father. And I have not been in the presence of this particular Holy Father. Obviously, CARDINAL visits with the last great man, and I am looking forward to this. I am looking forward to hearing him. I will be in a listening mode. And then Prime Minister PERSON, with whom I have had a long relationship. I knew him when he was the head of the ORG. I can remember, fondly remember riding my mountain bike as hard as I could as he was jogging along the beaches in GPE, needling him on the way by-a sign of close friendship. We have got a good relationship. He is having to make difficult decisions in GPE, and I hope my visit will help boost his courage in doing the right thing in GPE. And then, of course, GPE-I am looking forward to that as well. I am looking forward to seeing the leadership there. GPE has made some very difficult decisions, but necessary decisions. It is going to be-I love going to countries that may not expect to see the GPE President. It is pretty predictable that the President would go to GPE or GPE, probably GPE and GPE, but not necessarily GPE and GPE. And it is going to be a great honor for me to be in your country. I am looking forward to it. I am excited about the trip. I gave a speech DATE. I do not know if you suffered through it or not, but it is -anyway, I was proud to give it, and I meant what I said. And we have got a darn good record, and I am going to be taking that record, on behalf of the NORP people, to ORG and hoping to encourage others to match it. You can call me ORG. Now, given his angry response to missile defense, do you regret choosing GPE and GPE as possible sites for the missile defense? The reason this country has been chosen is because it will make the missile defense system more effective as we provide defenses for most of our ORG allies. Did he disappoint you? He is a-he is concerned about the missile defense system. He thinks it is aimed at him. It is aimed at rogue regimes that would use a missile to achieve political objective or to create unrest. And therefore, I sent Secretary PERSON to see the leadership, the NORP leadership, to explain our intentions. We have invited the NORP to participate, totally transparent-- We are totally transparent in our designs. We want them to see our technologies. PERSON was very instrumental in us reaching out to the NORP; she was deeply concerned about the ramifications of this decision. Secondly, it is-I repeat, we have nothing to hide. PERSON said, you know, this kind of rhetoric is the kind of rhetoric that relives the cold war. We are now into DATE, where we need to deal with the true threats, which are threats of radical extremists who will kill to advance an ideology and the threats of proliferation. And there is a lot of work we can do together to deal with these threats. And that is what I will continue talking to President PERSON about. Yes, it has. What needs to be done to avoid this relationship to degenerate further into a deep and lasting crisis? And in general, on that note, you set up the conversation. For the GPE cannot speak for the GPE-Russian relationship; that is recently where there is been some tension, as you noted, for the GPE relationship. It is a complex relationship where we have got some areas of agreement and some areas of disagreement. We believe strongly in democracy. PERSON will tell me that GPE is a democracy and that he is advancing democracy. We have got some questions about that, of course. We believe that actions taken in GPE, for example-in relation to the actions taken in GPE were-it sent a confusing signal to us. We obviously have got a difficult issue with GPE. We believe we ought to advance the PERSON agreement through ORG. But disagreement on issues does not mean that the relations are not cordial. As a matter of fact, I have found that it is easier to disagree on issues when you have a cordial relationship. It means you can discuss your differences without hostility, which makes it easier that you can find common ground. And we have common ground with GPE on matters like GPE. We have worked closely with GPE in ORG to send a clear signal to the NORP that their attempts at a nuclear weapon will be met with resistance, unified resistance. The issue of proliferation is one where there is good cooperation between GPE and GPE. It is in the world's interest that GPE and GPE and other nations work together to stop proliferators from being able to get a hold of materials that could end up harming innocent people. We have worked with GPE on GPE. As you know, we spoke with CARDINAL voice to the leadership in GPE, that GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE strongly oppose their desire to have a weapons program. And hopefully, we can make progress. In other words, one should not be surprised that there are differences. And the fundamental question in world diplomacy is, how do you deal with the differences? Do you deal with them that ends up, hopefully, creating more opportunities for cooperation, or do you deal with them in such a way as it creates-it widens gulfs and creates more antagonisms? And my relationship with GPE is firm. I tell people what I believe based upon certain principles. But it is going to be in such a way that treats people with respect. I have noticed that PERSON has also had to deal with PERSON and has done so in a very respectful but firm way. And I admire the way she is handled her diplomacy. She has proven herself to be a very strong leader. And for that, I am grateful, and I hope the NORP people are as well. ENTITY, your administration, you just said, offers a lot to GPE to gain acceptance, GPE's acceptance to idea building--missile shield. And at the same time, so far, it does not seem that you offer much to GPE, which is supposed to host the interceptor site. How would you convince people in GPE, who are frankly not that much afraid of uranium threat, but they are listening to the threats from GPE very carefully? First of all, GPE and the GPE are in ORG, and an attack on one is an attack on all. We cannot offer any better security agreement than that, and we mean it. If you are an ally of GPE and ORG and you feel threatened by an outside force, we will help you. I do not believe that there would be-I would certainly hope that GPE will not be threatened again by an outside force. I can understand why people in GPE could be nervous about that. After all, it is been a terrible part of your history. But as an ally in ORG, I cannot make a stronger statement than to say we stand with you, and in this case, this ally actually means it, and so do ORG allies. You know, I am sure there is probably some skepticism from some older folks or those who study history, where GPE had been given assurances and those assurances did not come through. Well, in this case, they will. I do not view GPE as being under any military threat. Obviously, there are differences you have with GPE over meat, and I am very aware of that. It is an ORG matter; it is a matter that PERSON is working hard, as the head of the ORG at this point in time, to address that problem. The best way to compensate GPE for our friendship is to have good, strong bilateral relations. As you know, we have worked hard on different agreements that would help create jobs. It is really the best thing that a relationship can do, is yield tangible benefits for people besides peace and security. And job creation and decent-paying jobs benefit society as a whole. And we will keep it that way. I am sure I will be discussing that with the President. What are the values that you believe you share with this Pope? What common ground you may have with ORG on issues like GPE or GPE or GPE? The common values are respect for human life, human-and dignity. I think His Holy Father will be pleased to know that much of our foreign policy is based on the admonition, to whom much is given, much is required. I look forward to sharing with him our sincere desire to help alleviate poverty and hunger and disease. I will remind him-in FAC DATE, I talked about spending MONEY on our battle against HIV/AIDS, particularly on the continent of Africa. Our initiative is, thus far, a MONEY initiative over DATE, that is helped provide antiretroviral drugs for CARDINAL people in a DATE period, up from CARDINAL. Many of those folks who are helping to carry out that initiative are people from NORP charities or NORP congregations here in GPE. And I will tell him how proud I am of our NORP citizens who have volunteered, in many cases, to help relieve suffering around the world. I will also talk to him about our malaria initiative where we believe we will have gotten help to folks, particularly on the continent of Africa, in the form of nets and insecticides and medicines, to CARDINAL people. I will remind him that this commitment is real and sincere. I believe he believes-look, I do not want to put words in his mouth-I hope he believes in the universality of freedom because I certainly do. In other words, freedom is not just a Western ideal; it is just not the ideal that some people-it is universal in application. I will remind him of my firm belief that freedom is not only universal, but history has proven democracies tend not to war with each other and that the best way to yield the peace-something I long for-is to help people become free. I have read CARDINAL of his works, and I am looking forward to hearing this good, decent, honorable man share some thoughts with me. Just in terms of other issues, I will- if he cares to talk about GPE, I'd love to talk about GPE. We expect there to be elections and free press, free prisoners. You mentioned GPE; I will confirm our strong support for ORG. I am impressed by his courage. And I will explain to him that CARDINAL of the reasons why we felt like it was important to go through with the PERSON trial for the ORG was to enhance ORG. And it is to make it clear that there is been foreign interference in that country, and we expect that foreign interference to stop. I will tell him that there, too, we have got good relations, and I intend to keep them that way. Part of having good relations with a country is being in a position to talk about religious freedoms. I would remind him that I have been to church in GPE and actually found it to be a spiritual experience. But I will assure him that I will continue to make the case for ORG inside of GPE. CARDINAL of the things I do not know if he knows I know, but there has been an attempt to get a good interface between ORG and ORG so that eventually the prescribed leadership, NORP leadership, would be able to have an active role in GPE. So far, ORG has resisted this, but I have been in-received several entreaties from our NORP cardinals here on behalf of His Holy Father to reach out to the NORP. And if he cares, I will be glad to summarize those contacts with him. ENTITY, concerning the shield, the antimissile shield, I know GPE is one of the newest members of ORG. But as I know, the shield will not cover the southeastern part of ORG, including GPE. And there are NORP military facilities in this country, which makes some people nervous there. Are you planning to change the situation? The missile defense that we are talking about is primarily for the longer term missile. And you are right; that will not cover all of ORG. It will cover most of ORG. GPE will be covered by ORG missile defenses for intermediate-range missiles, and I will be glad to make that case. It is important for our ORG-when I am in GPE, it is important for our ORG allies not to feel like defenses apply to some but not everybody. And as you know, we are in discussions about access bases, which also, I would hope, would provide a sense of security. The first goal, of course, is to work with everybody in your neighborhood to try to convince them to be peaceful in the first place so that the defenses are not needed. And as you know, I am deeply concerned about GPE having a nuclear weapon that could fly toward Europe or, for that matter, toward any other allies. And we do not want to ever have ourselves in a position where the world could become blackmailed. And, therefore, CARDINAL way to deal with this issue is through a missile defense system. However, such a weapon, in this particular scenario, would not affect GPE; it would be a much smaller one for which we have different technologies, ORG technologies, available. Yes, you can call me ENTITY. You already told me that once. ENTITY, for better or worse, you undoubtedly changed modern history of this vote. I mean, are you happy with your decisions? Are you comfortable with your decisions? Are you listening to criticism around the world? Yes, PERSON, I hear what people say, and I am very comfortable with my decisions, absolutely. Our country came under attack, and I vowed to the NORP people I would do all in my power to protect it. And it is still under threat. And the best way to protect GPE is to stay on the offense and bring people to justice before they hurt us. we work with allies and friends, and we share intelligence. We help cut off money; we disrupt, jointly-- I also knew that we had to deal with threats before they came to hurt us, whether it be in GPE and GPE; I made the right decisions. And I believe it is in all our interests that these democracies survive. In some cases, GPE and GPE, in some cases, only GPE; either case, they are very important. If democracies cannot help other democracies, then I worry about stability and peace in the long run. Matter of fact, I was amazed by-he asked, do I feel abandoned? I feel that we are in this long-term struggle with a lot of strong allies-a lot. There is a lot of people in GPE that committed resources and manpower and effort. A lot of people in GPE, all the ORG countries have got manpower there, plus a lot of other countries. And, you know, you have got to work at them. I constantly remind people there is a threat. My roommate in college was PERSON. He was from GPE, though. ENTITY, in the run-up to the ORG meeting, our energy-our climate change turnout will be a divisive issue, at least to the NORP press. Does it help to bridge the gap between the GPE position and the NORP position, which includes firm mandatory caps on greenhouse gases? Or have you basically preempted ORG? No, look, first of all, your opening question was, the NORP press is looking for conflict. Is that what you said? I do not want to misquote you. I think, look, if people want to try to figure out a way to be divisive, they will try to create divisions. I do not view it that way. I view this as an effort by concerned nations to reach common accord to actually solve the problem. We will take the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases and come up with an international goal. And I suggested, here is CARDINAL way to deal with the PERSON world. First thing that the Chancellor wanted to know is, did I agree there ought to be a PERSON framework. That is the threshold question, because if it is no, then we can end the conversation; if it is yes, then what are your suggestions? And I believe PERSON will be pleased with that because she is-this was something she was working toward. How we arrive at that goal is-I set out a process where greenhouse gas emitters, including developing nations, ought to be at the table. As you know full well, that one could have a very strict regime on greenhouse gases, but if nothing were done with countries like GPE or GPE, all would be for naught. So I thought it made sense to include a variety of nations that are actually producing greenhouse gases, including GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE and the ORG and others. Thirdly, I said that each nation needs to come up with an interim goal and develop the methodology to achieve that goal. Now, I said this in FAC, next to the Chancellor and PERSON, that each country has got to develop a plan that suits its own economy and suits its own political environment. If you want the GPE to be an active participant, that is the best way to do it as well. A lot of people do not particularly want our environmental policy written by somebody else. They think we ought to be writing our own environmental policy, in this case, to achieve international goals. I am looking forward to it. CARDINAL, energy independent; CARDINAL, economic vitality and growth. And as an active trading partner with GPE, you would want us to be economically strong. And finally, a strong steward of the environment, and technology is going to lead us there. And I look forward to explaining some of the technological breakthroughs that we have achieved and will achieve. You probably do not know this, but we are up to QUANTITY of corn ethanol now being used in our cars. Over DATE, PERCENT of every automobile in GPE will be flex-fuel. In other words, you can either use ethanol or gasoline; your choice. But we are spending MONEY-or MONEY, MONEY, on coming up with the ability to break down different forms of feedstocks to produce ethanol. That is called cellulosic ethanol, like switchgrasses or wood chips. Would not it be remarkable when we have a breakthrough to develop fuel to run our automobiles from wood chips? You got a lot of wood in GPE. I'd be glad to share that technology with you. We will have a mandatory fuel standard that will reduce our gasoline consumption by PERCENT over DATE. No President has ever said that. I happen to believe that there is going to be some significant battery technology breakthroughs as well, and I look forward to sharing that with our partners. Matter of fact, the NORP are spending a lot of money on battery technologies, and it is very conceivable one day we will be having hybrid plug-in battery-driven vehicles with a regular-sized automobile. You can do it with a golf cart now, but on a lot of our freeways, it would be dangerous--yours too. The fundamental question facing GPE is, how fast can we develop CARDINAL-emission coal-fired electricity plants? And we are spending a lot of money there, and we look forward to sharing technologies with our allies and friends and people who need help. And so we have got a very strong agenda that I am looking forward to sharing in ORG. And one of the things I am going to do is encourage others to step up to the research and development arena. They ought to be spending as much as we are. And then we ought to be willing to share that technology with developing countries. And finally, if you are really interested in solving greenhouse gases and making sure your economy grows, you ought to be for civilian nuclear power, And we are spending-we are advancing an interesting initiative with GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE on coming up with new technologies on fast-burner reactors in order to be able to deal with the waste issue. Anyway, there is a lot to talk about, and so I am looking forward to it. just like feeding the hungry is important; just like solving HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa is important; just like dealing with malaria is important; just like poor children, particularly women, girls, getting an education is important. These are all important initiatives, and I cannot wait to discuss them there. Last time you were in Eastern Europe, DATE in GPE and GPE, you promised changes in visa regime for your close allies. I promised I would work on it. ENTITY, make sure you quote me correctly. Yes, let me talk about it. It affects GPE, it affects GPE, and it affects GPE. I fully understand the frustrations of countries and people of countries who have supported friendship with GPE. And they look at neighbors in the ORG or ORG and say, wait TIME; we are treated differently. I understand that. This is an issue that your leaders have spoken very candidly with me. And I told them I did not -I thought it was unfair that the NORP citizen be given a type of visa and not the NORP citizen. And we are working closely with ORG to change long-standing law. First of all, we set up a way forward, a roadmap to visa changes. And I said I would work with our ORG to come up with a fair law that treated people fairly. We have yet to pass the law, but we are working with ORG. There is, as you may or may not know, a healthy immigration debate taking place in GPE. I am a big proponent of what we call comprehensive immigration reform, as I am a proponent of visa reform, visa waiver reform. I cannot give you a firm prediction as to exactly when this will emerge from ORG, but we are working hard to see if we cannot get it done. ENTITY, you said that you hope that your arrival will boost Mr. PERSON's energy on GPE. No, let me rephrase that. Can I restate that? I do not want to boost his energy. I do want to sit down and talk to him about how important the NORP commitment is to GPE and its future, is really what I meant to say. And that was what my question was about. What would you like GPE to do in GPE and, more in general, in the war on terror? How do you see GPE as a global partner on this issue? And, also, if you can spend a few words on the protesters that will receive you in GPE. I am going to meet some protesters in GPE again? They declared DATE. First of all, when you go to free societies, you tend to see protesters. Freedom of speech, that is what we are talking about. I presume there is going to be a few in GPE, just like there were-listen, when world leaders get together, or a leader shows up that people pay attention to, people get on TV by protesting. They have got different causes, and they want to express themselves. And I welcome going to a society where people are free to speak. It is a sign of a robust society. We had a few, one time, in GPE, if you remember. And the other question was about GPE, GPE's role in GPE. First of all, commitment to GPE, itself, helps. We want to help you; we know you are struggling. And it encourages people. The idea of saying we are a robust, free society, and we want to stand with you as you try to develop your own society in your own image is important to the psychology of the country. police training, judicial training. And in the war on terror, the idea of sharing intelligence when we find it, it is in both our interests. If we know somebody is plotting and planning in GPE, we will share that information, and vice versa. And that is really what matters, is the ability to talk to each other in such a way that if we have information that is beneficial for one or the other, we are comfortable enough of sharing that information so we can protect ourselves. Make no mistake about it, the enemy wants to strike again. These are ideologues who have got ambitions, and it is very important that we all take them seriously. the commitment to work together, the commitment to watch their finances, the commitment to understand what they are thinking and what they are doing. And they will kill you like that, in order to achieve their objectives; make no mistake about it. And the temptation is to say, oh, no, it is just a couple of guys that are not that dangerous. They are dangerous, and I will remind our friends. GPE has been a strong partner in a lot of areas, and I appreciate it. Back to GPE-you know that sometimes you spoke about the energy and energy security. Sometimes energy is used as a political tool, especially if there is a sense of-in Eastern Europe that GPE is using its oil and gas as a political tool. Do you have any leverage on GPE and the GPE in this field of energy security? And very crucial events happened during both your terms, and crucial decisions were taken here in this building. What world and what future for this great country do you envision in DATE? I do have, I do not know, DATE? First thing you have got to know about me is, I am going to sprint to the finish. I have got a lot to do, and I am going to work as hard as I can to get it done. You have heard me talk about a lot of issues. We have got an engagement in GPE and GPE, on HIV/AIDS and feeding the hungry and dealing with proliferation, and working on the environment. I believe people ought to have more money in their pocket; that is how you grow your economies. We are talking about health care, a big education reform, and immigration reform. There is a lot to do, and I do not have that much time to think beyond my Presidency. I am occupied with the moment. That is the way-I will put a lot of energy into the final 18 months and give it my all. That is all you can do in life is give it your best. That is what I am going to do. I owe that to the NORP people. My concern for GPE is that we never become an isolationist nation or a protectionist nation. We have had those tendencies in the past. I am not suggesting that is where we are, but I am worried that that might happen at some point in time. Or, It is too difficult to fight the terrorists. Or, It is too difficult to help advance democracy; let us just kind of retreat. I think it would be a huge mistake for GPE. I would hope that DATE GPE still works with other nations to advance liberty. I remind people about my NORP friend Prime Minister PERSON, now Prime Minister PERSON, PERSON, a good guy. Is not it interesting that the GPE President sits at the table with the NORP Prime Minister to talk about peace, and my father fought them, and they were the sworn enemy? And now we are working together on peace. Liberty has got an amazing way of transforming enemies into friends-same in GPE, in many ways. I would hope GPE would never lose sight of that capacity. You have got your worries about supplies of energy, and so do I- where we get our energy from. If you are interested in reducing dependence on crude oil, then what you do is develop different ways to power your automobiles. And so we are using corn to power our automobiles. That way we do not have to use gasoline and therefore use crude oil as a feedstock. My goal is to make us nearly totally independent from foreign sources of oil. And that ought to be the goal of a nation that worries from sole-source supplier, that you ought to figure out different ways to do it. How do you do it? Well, you can do it through nuclear technology, for example; as opposed to using natural gas to power your electricity, use nuclear technology. Hopefully, we can come with clean coal technologies so that you can burn coal. We need to do it in GPE. We have got DATE of coal supply. Coal is a particular problem when it comes to pollution; we know that. We spent MONEY on your ORG plant, clean coal technologies. We believe that we will be able to develop a coal-fired plant that has CARDINAL emissions. And when that technology comes to fruition, if you can get yourself some coal, you have got your ability to diversify away from sole-source supplier of energy. And that is what technology is going to yield. I truly believe over DATE, you are going to see some amazing technological breakthroughs. And I believe and hope that those technological breakthroughs will make a lot of the discussions we are having here at DATE moot, relative to energy security and environmental quality. I believe some of the discussions I have had with you about battery technologies will be real. We are spending MONEY on hydrogen technologies. We believe that cars will be powered by hydrogen, which will obviously relieve pressure on crude oil dependence. The emissions of hydrogen-driven automobiles is going to be driblets of water, which will be good for the environment. And you know, I would hope that mankind does not lose faith in the capacity of technology to transform the way we live in positive ways. Here in GPE, what is interesting is to watch some of the investment flows of private capital. We are a system based upon private capital. And so I talked about, in my speech DATE, about public capital investment, public tax dollars going into research and development, MONEY over DATE that I have been President. But there is enormous sums of money going into the private markets as well, because people see economic opportunity can be derived by new energy technologies. And it is that synergy to be derived from public participation and public policy, the declaration of a mandatory fuel standard coupled with private sector investments that could yield breakthroughs. I like the idea that the NORP are pushing hard for battery technologies. I want our people pushing hard for battery technologies. It yields better product for consumers. It makes us all work more efficiently and wiser in the end. And I am excited to be a part of it. I have got DATE to be a part of it here in this capacity, and it is going to be DATE.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists7", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-journalists-7", "publication_date": "31-05-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 12, "text": "I am looking forward to my trip. This is the seventh ORG summit that I have been to. I find them to be important for GPE in the following ways. CARDINAL, it is an opportunity to stress the importance that we place upon basic values, basic value of liberty, basic value of open markets in order to enhance prosperity. It is a chance to remind people that we are linked together. It is an interesting setting, when you have people from different cultures, different languages come together for a common purpose. It is also a chance for me to remind our country how important it is to have constructive ties in Asia. Asia is a place where we have spilt a lot of blood in the past, and now it is a place of peace. Asia is a place where GPE was engaged militarily, and now we are engaged culturally and socially and economically in a way that is constructive for our peoples. It will be an opportunity for-remind me that it is possible for enemies to be allies and for enemies to be friends. It is a lesson for a lot of us to think about when we think about the Middle East, that forms of government matter and hopeful societies yield peace. I am looking forward to the discussions about trade. The first priority for trade for me at the meeting will be on GPE. I am a firm believer in free trade. I believe the GPE round is the best opportunity for us to accomplish a couple of objectives. CARDINAL is to fight off protectionism and trade freely, and secondly is to help eliminate poverty. This will be an opportunity for the leaders of the ORG summit to express their desire to see the GPE round succeed. We will take the lead in that, along with other nations. There is also an opportunity for us to start talking about a free trade agreement of the Pacific region. And I am looking forward to having that dialog, begin the dialog. It would just be kind of an interesting opportunity to have the dialog on this aspect of our strategic partnership there and to move forward. We have got a lot of-we have got some free trade agreements with people, and that will be at the table. Opportunity for me to continue to talk about the struggle between radicalism and reasonableness, between extremism and people that want to live in peace. I happen to believe-I am sure you have heard me say this-that we are in a major ideological struggle-a struggle we will win, by the way. But it is going to require resolve and dedication. And this will be an opportunity for me to remind our friends at the table that this is the call of our time and that we have an opportunity to write a hopeful chapter here in DATE and to thank people around the table for understanding this is the call of the time, because there is been a lot of constructive engagement and good work, all aimed at protecting ourselves from short-term attack-in the short term from attack and recognizing that changing conditions of life in the long term will enable us to live in peace. And finally, I am looking forward to reminding people that I take the climate change issue seriously; that we recognize that there needs to be international-an international accord to get people at the table who are the major emitters to set a goal. Step CARDINAL to solving a problem is to set the goal on what we ought to achieve. If you want somebody to be a part of the problem-a part of the solution, you need to let them be a part of defining what the goal ought to be. So many of the people at the ORG table are going to come to the major economy conference that-those of us who are emitters will be there, including GPE, which will be at the table. I do not want to single GPE out, but GPE has got a major role to play. Any agreement without GPE is not going to be an effective agreement. So my strategy has been to get GPE at the table. We will further the dialog. PERSON has got some very interesting ways to further the dialog in a constructive way, particularly talking about energy usage. So we will be looking forward to his leadership on the issue. When I told him I was looking forward to coming, we discussed this issue. He is concerned about greenhouse gases. And so he will take the lead here at the conference, and GPE will play a constructive role. We have got a big agenda. It is my second trip to GPE. I remind people that GPE-parts of GPE reminds me of GPE--and there is no higher compliment. I think on behalf of all of us, I can say thank you very much for this opportunity DATE. As you have just analyzed, ENTITY, obviously GPE and the Middle East, the war on terror is an overarching policy issue for the PERSON administration. Nonetheless, there has been a perception in the region that this has distracted GPE from engagement in Asia. Some people are calling this the Pacific DATE. You are cutting short your trip to GPE because of the GPE issue. I am just wondering, do you think that is warranted, that criticism, and do you see GPE, for instance, playing the role-the driver in DATE, not the GPE? No, it is interesting, first of all, this administration has got good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE. Our relationship with the ORG countries are as strong as GPE has ever been, and of course our ties with GPE are tight, really tight. And the reason I say that is, is that this just does not happen without work. And I have worked hard to develop bilateral relations in such a way that we can achieve strategic objectives. I believe the relations with GPE and the Asian-Pacific region have never been better, and as a result, we are addressing problems and creating opportunities. CARDINAL problem, of course, is GPE. When I came into office, the world was expecting GPE to solve the GPE issue alone. To me-and the NORP leader had basically not honored the bilateral agreement that had been struck, and therefore, felt like we needed to put this issue in a position in which others were speaking besides GPE-and have started the CARDINAL-party talks. CARDINAL countries were convinced to come to the table on CARDINAL side to convince the NORP leader to give up his nuclear weapons ambitions. That would not have happened without engagement and good, solid relations. Another issue obviously is our bilateral relations with GPE. It is the same-you are in a little different position in that you have got a nice trade surplus with GPE. We have got a trade deficit with GPE. And it is important for us to have a-given the complexity of our relationship, that we have got a strategic relationship that allows for engagement and for us to help deal with a major trade deficit, for example, and/or product safety or a SARS outbreak. Secretary PERSON-I empowered Secretary PERSON to develop this special working relationship with GPE. And it requires a lot of engagement. It requires engagement at the top, with President PERSON, who I respect, as well as people in my ORG. For those who argue that, they really have not -frankly have not followed how engaged we have been. Is GPE an issue for the world? But I do not view it as a negative issue; I view it as an opportunity to work with a-one of the really significantly growing economies in the world. First, I view that a growing middle class in GPE is good for GPE exporters. It provides opportunity. And it is -by the way, it is not only good for GPE exports; it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP, NORP. Anybody who is making a product somebody wants, it is just a good opportunity. And so as a part of our engagement with GPE, we have worked with PERSON to convince him to help convert his economy from one of savers to one of consumers, which means-and by the way, that takes a lot of effort and work to get in a position where you can even make those kind of constructive suggestions-which means the development of a pension system or health care, so that people do not feel like they have to hoard their money to save for a rainy day, but in fact, there is some kind of safety net that is predictable, which then would convert a NORP person who is beginning to realize better income into a consumer. And then all of a sudden, you have got consumers, which provide opportunity. Huge economic opportunity-you see GPE as the big grower of the economy in the Asia Pacific? No, I see GPE as the big driver for trade. At ORG, people ought to be wondering whether or not PERSON is going to keep taxes low to make sure our economy continues to grow, because we are a significant trading partner. I view GPE as an opportunity. I think GPE is going to drive a lot of the trade. That is why we conducted-now, having said that, I think GPE will provide opportunity for NORP producers, but we also provide the same opportunity. I do not view it as a CARDINAL-sum game, let me put it to you that way. I view it as an-I view-all of us contribute, so long as the world does not slip into protectionism. And part of the reason one goes to ORG is to promote trade and opportunity. And how do you plan to win the hearts and win the markets in the world, including in NORP countries like GPE? Well, I think, first of all, we have a complex relationship with GPE. GPE strongly supports markets. On the other hand, we also support open societies, transparency, where people are allowed to express themselves in a free society. I believe in freedom of religion. I believe in basic freedoms. So our relationship with GPE is, on the CARDINAL hand, we welcome trading opportunities. And what makes the relationship even more complex is, at the same time, we believe in human rights and human dignity. And we worked with the NORP leadership to promote human rights and human dignity. So it is not-it is hard to define the relationship in kind of a simple, CARDINAL-sentence structure. As I told you, I view GPE as a positive opportunity. I like him; I like to talk to him. We can share issues together. And he can say to me, What are your problems? In other words, we have got a personal relationship. And that is the way I try to do with all leaders because the best diplomacy is when you can sit down with somebody one on CARDINAL and speak candidly about issues and problems. See, that is what leaders do. You see problems and you anticipate problems and work together to accomplish something. I have also got a very good relationship with your leader. And so bilateral relations-first of all, in the NORP world, it is very important for people to understand that the war on terror is not a war against NORP; it is a war against murderers. I do not believe religious people, truly religious people kill the innocent. And therefore, it is important for leaders and countries to work together to prevent the murder of the innocent and, at the same time, make sure that we respect-GPE, in my case, respects religion, values the right for people to worship, and, in the case of ORG, values ORG as an important part of the international scene in the world we live in. Yes, well, I am better for it. I have a question on GPE. Is it possible that GPE will give up nuclear weapons program by the end of your term? And to help achieve it, are you ready to remove GPE from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, even without the resolution of NORP abductee issue? As to the first part of your question, I certainly hope that GPE honors its agreements. They-in DATE, they made a substantial agreement to disclose and dismantle all aspects of a nuclear weapons program. And here we are in DATE, DATE, where we are still reminding them of that agreement. On the other hand, a lot has happened in DATE that would lead me to believe that we are on- we are making progress. And we will continue to push toward the full disclosure and dismantlement. Secondly, we have-different aspects of our relationship are on the table, but it is performance based. In other words, we expect people to honor their agreements. Finally, as I assured Prime Minister PERSON, that we are not going to forget the abductee issue. He and the NORP people are very concerned that once certain aspects of the agreement are achieved, that we will forget the fact that NORP citizens have been abducted. ENTITY. I will never forget the meeting I had with the mother-it is very important for your readers to know that that had a deep impression on me- the mother whose daughter was abducted by NORP. I cannot imagine what that would mean. I guess I can imagine what it would mean; I just cannot understand, fully understand the pain that she felt-still feels. And I will never forget her coming to FAC with the picture of that little girl, picture of her daughter who got abducted. She sat right there in FAC. And my point to you is, is that I am not going to forget the mother or forget the fact. And so we will work with the-continue to work with the NORP to make it clear to NORP that we also expect there to be resolution to this issue. In other words, I understand, as well as I possibly can, the emotion that people attach to this issue. But now that I am DATE, it is not that old. It is all in your mind. Sir, your administration has indicated interest to appoint a special envoy to the ORG of Islamic Conference, or the ORG. Have you identified the person? And what will he or she do to bridge relations with the NORP countries in the NORP world, in light of the war in GPE and in light of the detention of extremists from NORP countries? First of all, we have not identified the person yet. We are working toward that end. As a matter of fact, I spoke to the Secretary of ORG about this TIME, coincidentally enough. Anyway, we are working the issue. Secondly, the reason why I suggested- or announced that we are going to do this is because I am concerned about the perceptions in the NORP world that GPE views the war on terror as a war against a particular religion. And I just explained to you that this is a war of extremists and radicals, ideologues driven by a vision that is not-that hijacks religion in order to justify their position. And any chance we have to dispel false notion and to reinforce the realities is helpful to GPE and frankly others as well. And so that is the reason to name the envoy. It also is a clear signal that we respect nations and that we treat the NORP world seriously. And you can do that all different kinds of ways. It is another moment for people to see the seriousness of intent. In terms of-murder is murder, and murder to achieve political objectives is-needs to be stopped. People murdered NORP to achieve a political objective. There is a debate in our country whether that is true or not. I have made up my mind. I believe it is absolutely fundamentally true because I am listening to what the enemy says, the enemy of freedom, what they are saying. They say, We want a caliphate, we want to spread our vision. It took a military action, by the way, to liberate people from that vision in GPE. This was not an attack on ORG; this was an attack for liberty. Think about a society in which you CARDINAL could not function in what you are doing because of your gender. Because the vision of these people-who murder the innocent, by the way, to achieve their vision-is that women are not equal. And it just so happened that, given the way the world is DATE, that that kind of ideologue provided safe haven for people who plotted and killed people in our country. CARDINAL, I am not going to stand for it; I am going to protect GPE, just like any other leader would protect their own country. And CARDINAL, CARDINAL way to achieve long-term peace is to help people realize forms of government that give hope. And so whether it be in GPE and GPE, we are helping people realize the blessings of freedom. Freedom yields peace. Forms of government matter. And so the ambassador to the ORG or the President or any other representative of GPE will be expressing this deep desire to work together to achieve peace. ENTITY, what do you think you have achieved with regards to GPE ties with Asia during your time in office? In other words, we are making progress. The first step was to get people to the table, to remind people that it is just not GPE with responsibility. The purpose of the-getting all QUANTITY of us to the table is so that if GPE tried to say, Well, I am really-I said I was going to do it, but I am not going to do it, then there is somebody else also saying, And here are the consequences. And now it is beginning to work because they are verifiably beginning to shut down the reactor. And so we have got more to do. Unfinished is kind of a loaded word, in a way. But I am not-we are not in control of- we are in control of putting the process in place and making sure it is consequential if somebody does not go forward. But it is the leader of GPE who gets to the make the decision. I have made my choice. Let me reiterate a little bit of what I said earlier. The definition of successful foreign policy is to be in a position to work with others to solve problems. And this administration has worked hard to be in a position to convince others to work together to solve problems. I have just outlined some of the problems, some of the problems-whether or not trade is open and people are treated fairly. CARDINAL classic example of this is intellectual property rights. I know that is a deep concern to your Government, just like it is to all our governments, that if you are trading with a country, you want to make sure that those intellectual property rights are treated respectfully. And in some societies, it is difficult. And therefore, we have to be in a position to work collaboratively and bilaterally to convince countries that in order to be a part of the international world, you have to honor contract. And CARDINAL contract is, you do not steal somebody else's intellectual property. But nevertheless, those kind of relationships exist now; we are able to have those kind of dialogs. There is been a lot of cooperation on the security front in remarkable ways since I have been President. The leadership of your country knows full well the dangers of extremism prevailing and have been very strong in working, for example, on the Proliferation Security Initiative. This is an initiative where many ORG nations have agreed to help find and stop the shipment of materiels which could end up in the hands of extremists and radicals that could harm us. And it took a while to get this relationship in place. But it is a relationship that is necessary to help prevent weapons of mass destruction from being moved. And here is a classic case of a successful collaborative effort. The biggest danger we have, it seems like to me, is isolationism and protectionism becoming prevalent philosophies. CARDINAL of the things that this administration has done in working with our friends is to work hard to explain to people the beneficial nature of trading together. And therefore-and that is manifested, by the way, in, for example, the free trade agreement with GPE, which was not a given. And there were some difficulties to overcome in GPE and in GPE, but nevertheless, we got it done. And entering into free trade agreements with other nations, such as GPE, has been good ways of making sure that we codify the benefits of open trading relationships. And so there is been a lot of progress made, and the NORP issue is the issue that we are spending a lot of time on and, hopefully, we can get completed. Just to the domestic scene, we have got Federal elections, as you know, coming up in GPE. Last time around, you had some comments with regards to the then opposition leader's policies on GPE. You described his policy of withdrawal from GPE as disastrous. You have a one-on-CARDINAL meeting with the opposition leader, PERSON; he is ahead in the polls. He is also got a policy in GPE which talks about withdrawal, albeit with caveats. I am just wondering, what is your view of the opposition leader, PERSON? What will you discuss in the meeting? And what do you make of his GPE policy? Yes, first of all, I think it makes sense for me to reach out to leading political figures when I go to other countries. And so I am looking forward to this meeting. I do not know much about him, frankly. Obviously, I have not -maybe I met him; I do not remember meeting him. When I spoke to the Parliament-- I am going to remind him that, CARDINAL, the stakes in GPE are very high for peace; that the liberation of a country-that country was important for peace; and that a democracy-NORP-style democracy in the heart of the Middle East is part of winning this ideological struggle. So the first thing I am going to do is explain to him my views about this-the world in which we live. And I will remind him that, as far as I am concerned, that leaving GPE before the job is done will cause an enemy that attacked us before to become emboldened. And as PERSON put it, to think the enemy will stay there and not follow us here is- in other words, we leave before the job is done, they will follow us home. That-I will remind him that the best way to conduct policy is based upon conditions on the ground; that success is important; that conditions ought to be driving troop deployments. And that is how-I will tell him how-what I would hope all our coalition partners would view the situation in GPE and GPE. Having said that, I do appreciate very much the fact that the NORP have sacrificed and have served. And I am looking forward to seeing some NORP troops with Prime Minister PERSON to thank them and, as importantly, thank their families for joining GPE and a lot of other countries in the great cause of liberation and peace. It is going to be an interesting trip, and what is interesting about these trips is that the time around the table with leaders is important, but also the time sitting down with individuals is important as well. It is a good opportunity to conduct foreign policy. And as I told you, a lot of foreign policy, for me, is the capacity to just look at somebody in the eye and tell them what I think and listen to what they think. It is finding that common ground, if possible, to solve problems. And sometimes you can solve problems by anticipating them and putting the conditions in place so that they will not arise in the first place. And sometimes they just show up, and you better be in a position to deal with them. Can I just clarify something? PERSON is-his theater-he is talked about the importance of GPE, talking about withdrawing our troops from GPE. That he is determined to-he has determined that the issue on Afghanistan- to keep troops in GPE. I view both GPE and GPE as theaters of the same war against radicals and extremists and look forward to sharing my views with Mr. PERSON, of course, and continue our discussions, strategic discussions with PERSON. My next question would touch on NORP cleric PERSON. As you might know, since he was released from jail, has been exercising activities like any other citizens, including recently-DATE he inaugurated a long march participated by CARDINAL of his followers, in connection with that commemoration, or welcoming DATE NORP fasting DATE. Actually, how close has your Government monitored the activities of PERSON? First of all, I did not know he led a parade of CARDINAL people. So that may answer your first question. I am sure our Embassy is aware of the activities that take place in your country. I mean, you are a free country where people are allowed to express themselves in the public square, which is a sign of a healthy society. I am concerned, however, about anybody who preaches violence and extremism and radicalism in a world in which innocent people just get simply murdered for ideological purposes. There were some terrible murders in your country, as you know, just like in mine, and I am confident that by far the vast majority-all of GPE rejects that kind of behavior. Innocent people were killed in GPE for no other reason than they just happened to be vacationing and because somebody wanted to send a political message because they are involved with this ideological struggle. And those of us who want there to be peace have got to reject this kind of behavior. And so your Government is a government of law; your Government will conduct itself according to your laws. But anybody who preaches that kind of violence in the name of what I would call a dark political vision needs to be taken seriously. My next question is about the GPE relationship and the war on terror. The opposition party in GPE is threatening to cut the extension of NORP participation in the antiterrorism operations in the Indian Ocean. Are you concerned about that? And will you be-will you raise this issue when you will meet Prime Minister PERSON in GPE? First of all, GPE has been a positive contributor to dealing with the extremists in this ideological war. And I thank ORG and the people of GPE for their contributions. And I would hope that they would continue to maintain this-their positive influence. And of course, my conversations with Prime Minister PERSON, whom I respect a great deal, will center on the war on terror, as well as a lot of other key issues. GPE has played a significant role in many of the things we have discussed here, like Proliferation Security Initiative, CARDINAL-party talks. They have been a constructive partner in peace, and I will-we will talk about all aspects of our relationship. ENTITY, DATE,GPE celebrates its 50th-- Fiftieth-make sure my congratulatory remarks get in your article. PERSON Congratulates GPE. Do you think that is what it will say? It also marks the 50th relations between the GPE and GPE So what are your outlook and hopes for GPE relations, and especially with GPE being the 10th largest trading partner? First of all, I do believe we ought to have-take this notion of trade and have meaningful discussions with a potential free trade agreement with GPE. Secondly, I respect Prime Minister PERSON, admire his leadership. When his wife died, I tried to call him early just to let him know I cared about him. I will congratulate him. Do not put that in the article, that you had to tell me that. You can put it in there if you want. I will be glad to-I am going to congratulate him. You did congratulate him. I am going to congratulate him again. I will double the congratulations. That is right; I did write him a note. Did I call him or write him a note? You wrote him a note. Anyway, GPE is an interesting example of how a free society can deal with movements that could conceivably change and alter the nature of the free society. And I respect the way the Prime Minister has used freedom and used the openness of society to kind of deal with frustration. I mean, all societies have frustrated people. And the question is, will the outlet of that frustration lead to violence or lead to peace? And GPE is an example of a country where frustrations have been channeled in a constructive way. And therefore, he is a leader, as far as I am concerned, and a very constructive force for Southeast Asia. By the way, I am going to meet with the ORG leaders, which is an important meeting as well. It is an opportunity for GPE to stay very much engaged with ORG. I unfortunately will not be there for the 60th, but look forward to having an event that would kind of recognize the importance of ORG as far as GPE is concerned. So this is a side meeting with the ORG leaders after ORG meeting, sir? I try to do that every time. So they will have somebody like-I will sit down and meet with the ORG nations as well. The other thing that is interesting about GPE is, they are going to be one of the leaders on alternative fuels. I believe that it is in our interests that we develop the technologies necessary to deal with energy dependence as well as greenhouse gases. Back to the climate changes-the way-if you are truly interested in dealing with greenhouse gases, people need to focus on the development of technologies that will enable us to, on the CARDINAL hand, grow our economies, on the other hand, be good stewards of the environment. Just for the record-and this probably will not be a headline, although I have tried to make it one a lot-when it comes time to climate change, there is CARDINAL major industrialized nation that actually grew its economy and reduced greenhouse gases; that would be GPE that actually had greenhouse gases go down and the economy go up. So something is working here, and it is technologies, use of technologies. And so I am going to be reminding people about-that we can come up with a strategy that does not impoverish our people and, at the same time, takes advantage of technologies. And we are going to need to share some technologies with newly emerging economies in order to achieve this objective. Anyway, I forgot to make that point. I am not making the point to you, as you can tell. That is why I am kind of looking over your shoulder. There appears to be a perception in Southeast Asia that this administration has neglected the region. How do you plan to convince them otherwise when you meet in ORG? Well, I-do you want to ask another question, because I already answered it. I will be glad to answer it again- which is, we have got strong bilateral-first of all, the number of trips I have taken- I have gone to every ORG meeting. I have spent a lot of time with leaders both here and in your respective countries-that we have got relations to a point where we can work together to solve common problems. PSI is CARDINAL such example of a strategy we have implemented to deal with the realities of the world. And so it is -the truth of the matter is, I spend a lot of time working on NORP matters. And all I will ask you to do is look at the results of the individual relationships and the ability to put processes in place to deal with the threats we live in and the capacity to work together to solve problems and to create opportunities. And to me, that is a sign of a healthy, robust relationship with an important part of the world.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintmedia0", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Media", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-media-0", "publication_date": "30-08-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 12, "text": "I am looking forward to my trip. This is the seventh ORG summit that I have been to. I find them to be important for GPE in the following ways. CARDINAL, it is an opportunity to stress the importance that we place upon basic values, basic value of liberty, basic value of open markets in order to enhance prosperity. It is a chance to remind people that we are linked together. It is an interesting setting, when you have people from different cultures, different languages come together for a common purpose. It is also a chance for me to remind our country how important it is to have constructive ties in Asia. Asia is a place where we have spilt a lot of blood in the past, and now it is a place of peace. Asia is a place where GPE was engaged militarily, and now we are engaged culturally and socially and economically in a way that is constructive for our peoples. It will be an opportunity for-remind me that it is possible for enemies to be allies and for enemies to be friends. It is a lesson for a lot of us to think about when we think about the Middle East, that forms of government matter and hopeful societies yield peace. I am looking forward to the discussions about trade. The first priority for trade for me at the meeting will be on GPE. I am a firm believer in free trade. I believe the GPE round is the best opportunity for us to accomplish a couple of objectives. CARDINAL is to fight off protectionism and trade freely, and secondly is to help eliminate poverty. This will be an opportunity for the leaders of the ORG summit to express their desire to see the GPE round succeed. We will take the lead in that, along with other nations. There is also an opportunity for us to start talking about a free trade agreement of the Pacific region. And I am looking forward to having that dialog, begin the dialog. It would just be kind of an interesting opportunity to have the dialog on this aspect of our strategic partnership there and to move forward. We have got a lot of-we have got some free trade agreements with people, and that will be at the table. Opportunity for me to continue to talk about the struggle between radicalism and reasonableness, between extremism and people that want to live in peace. I happen to believe-I am sure you have heard me say this-that we are in a major ideological struggle-a struggle we will win, by the way. But it is going to require resolve and dedication. And this will be an opportunity for me to remind our friends at the table that this is the call of our time and that we have an opportunity to write a hopeful chapter here in DATE and to thank people around the table for understanding this is the call of the time, because there is been a lot of constructive engagement and good work, all aimed at protecting ourselves from short-term attack-in the short term from attack and recognizing that changing conditions of life in the long term will enable us to live in peace. And finally, I am looking forward to reminding people that I take the climate change issue seriously; that we recognize that there needs to be international-an international accord to get people at the table who are the major emitters to set a goal. Step CARDINAL to solving a problem is to set the goal on what we ought to achieve. If you want somebody to be a part of the problem-a part of the solution, you need to let them be a part of defining what the goal ought to be. So many of the people at the ORG table are going to come to the major economy conference that-those of us who are emitters will be there, including GPE, which will be at the table. I do not want to single GPE out, but GPE has got a major role to play. Any agreement without GPE is not going to be an effective agreement. So my strategy has been to get GPE at the table. We will further the dialog. PERSON has got some very interesting ways to further the dialog in a constructive way, particularly talking about energy usage. So we will be looking forward to his leadership on the issue. When I told him I was looking forward to coming, we discussed this issue. He is concerned about greenhouse gases. And so he will take the lead here at the conference, and GPE will play a constructive role. We have got a big agenda. It is my second trip to GPE. I remind people that GPE-parts of GPE reminds me of GPE--and there is no higher compliment. I think on behalf of all of us, I can say thank you very much for this opportunity DATE. As you have just analyzed, ENTITY, obviously GPE and the Middle East, the war on terror is an overarching policy issue for the PERSON administration. Nonetheless, there has been a perception in the region that this has distracted GPE from engagement in Asia. Some people are calling this the Pacific DATE. You are cutting short your trip to GPE because of the GPE issue. I am just wondering, do you think that is warranted, that criticism, and do you see GPE, for instance, playing the role-the driver in DATE, not the GPE? No, it is interesting, first of all, this administration has got good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE. Our relationship with the ORG countries are as strong as GPE has ever been, and of course our ties with GPE are tight, really tight. And the reason I say that is, is that this just does not happen without work. And I have worked hard to develop bilateral relations in such a way that we can achieve strategic objectives. I believe the relations with GPE and the Asian-Pacific region have never been better, and as a result, we are addressing problems and creating opportunities. CARDINAL problem, of course, is GPE. When I came into office, the world was expecting GPE to solve the GPE issue alone. To me-and the NORP leader had basically not honored the bilateral agreement that had been struck, and therefore, felt like we needed to put this issue in a position in which others were speaking besides GPE-and have started the CARDINAL-party talks. CARDINAL countries were convinced to come to the table on CARDINAL side to convince the NORP leader to give up his nuclear weapons ambitions. That would not have happened without engagement and good, solid relations. Another issue obviously is our bilateral relations with GPE. It is the same-you are in a little different position in that you have got a nice trade surplus with GPE. We have got a trade deficit with GPE. And it is important for us to have a-given the complexity of our relationship, that we have got a strategic relationship that allows for engagement and for us to help deal with a major trade deficit, for example, and/or product safety or a SARS outbreak. Secretary PERSON-I empowered Secretary PERSON to develop this special working relationship with GPE. And it requires a lot of engagement. It requires engagement at the top, with President PERSON, who I respect, as well as people in my ORG. For those who argue that, they really have not -frankly have not followed how engaged we have been. Is GPE an issue for the world? But I do not view it as a negative issue; I view it as an opportunity to work with a-one of the really significantly growing economies in the world. First, I view that a growing middle class in GPE is good for GPE exporters. It provides opportunity. And it is -by the way, it is not only good for GPE exports; it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP, NORP. Anybody who is making a product somebody wants, it is just a good opportunity. And so as a part of our engagement with GPE, we have worked with PERSON to convince him to help convert his economy from one of savers to one of consumers, which means-and by the way, that takes a lot of effort and work to get in a position where you can even make those kind of constructive suggestions-which means the development of a pension system or health care, so that people do not feel like they have to hoard their money to save for a rainy day, but in fact, there is some kind of safety net that is predictable, which then would convert a NORP person who is beginning to realize better income into a consumer. And then all of a sudden, you have got consumers, which provide opportunity. Huge economic opportunity-you see GPE as the big grower of the economy in the Asia Pacific? No, I see GPE as the big driver for trade. At ORG, people ought to be wondering whether or not PERSON is going to keep taxes low to make sure our economy continues to grow, because we are a significant trading partner. I view GPE as an opportunity. I think GPE is going to drive a lot of the trade. That is why we conducted-now, having said that, I think GPE will provide opportunity for NORP producers, but we also provide the same opportunity. I do not view it as a CARDINAL-sum game, let me put it to you that way. I view it as an-I view-all of us contribute, so long as the world does not slip into protectionism. And part of the reason one goes to ORG is to promote trade and opportunity. And how do you plan to win the hearts and win the markets in the world, including in NORP countries like GPE? Well, I think, first of all, we have a complex relationship with GPE. GPE strongly supports markets. On the other hand, we also support open societies, transparency, where people are allowed to express themselves in a free society. I believe in freedom of religion. I believe in basic freedoms. So our relationship with GPE is, on the CARDINAL hand, we welcome trading opportunities. And what makes the relationship even more complex is, at the same time, we believe in human rights and human dignity. And we worked with the NORP leadership to promote human rights and human dignity. So it is not-it is hard to define the relationship in kind of a simple, CARDINAL-sentence structure. As I told you, I view GPE as a positive opportunity. I like him; I like to talk to him. We can share issues together. And he can say to me, What are your problems? In other words, we have got a personal relationship. And that is the way I try to do with all leaders because the best diplomacy is when you can sit down with somebody one on CARDINAL and speak candidly about issues and problems. See, that is what leaders do. You see problems and you anticipate problems and work together to accomplish something. I have also got a very good relationship with your leader. And so bilateral relations-first of all, in the NORP world, it is very important for people to understand that the war on terror is not a war against NORP; it is a war against murderers. I do not believe religious people, truly religious people kill the innocent. And therefore, it is important for leaders and countries to work together to prevent the murder of the innocent and, at the same time, make sure that we respect-GPE, in my case, respects religion, values the right for people to worship, and, in the case of ORG, values ORG as an important part of the international scene in the world we live in. Yes, well, I am better for it. I have a question on GPE. Is it possible that GPE will give up nuclear weapons program by the end of your term? And to help achieve it, are you ready to remove GPE from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, even without the resolution of NORP abductee issue? As to the first part of your question, I certainly hope that GPE honors its agreements. They-in DATE, they made a substantial agreement to disclose and dismantle all aspects of a nuclear weapons program. And here we are in DATE, DATE, where we are still reminding them of that agreement. On the other hand, a lot has happened in DATE that would lead me to believe that we are on- we are making progress. And we will continue to push toward the full disclosure and dismantlement. Secondly, we have-different aspects of our relationship are on the table, but it is performance based. In other words, we expect people to honor their agreements. Finally, as I assured Prime Minister PERSON, that we are not going to forget the abductee issue. He and the NORP people are very concerned that once certain aspects of the agreement are achieved, that we will forget the fact that NORP citizens have been abducted. ENTITY. I will never forget the meeting I had with the mother-it is very important for your readers to know that that had a deep impression on me- the mother whose daughter was abducted by NORP. I cannot imagine what that would mean. I guess I can imagine what it would mean; I just cannot understand, fully understand the pain that she felt-still feels. And I will never forget her coming to FAC with the picture of that little girl, picture of her daughter who got abducted. She sat right there in FAC. And my point to you is, is that I am not going to forget the mother or forget the fact. And so we will work with the-continue to work with the NORP to make it clear to NORP that we also expect there to be resolution to this issue. In other words, I understand, as well as I possibly can, the emotion that people attach to this issue. But now that I am DATE, it is not that old. It is all in your mind. Sir, your administration has indicated interest to appoint a special envoy to the ORG of Islamic Conference, or the ORG. Have you identified the person? And what will he or she do to bridge relations with the NORP countries in the NORP world, in light of the war in GPE and in light of the detention of extremists from NORP countries? First of all, we have not identified the person yet. We are working toward that end. As a matter of fact, I spoke to the Secretary of ORG about this TIME, coincidentally enough. Anyway, we are working the issue. Secondly, the reason why I suggested- or announced that we are going to do this is because I am concerned about the perceptions in the NORP world that GPE views the war on terror as a war against a particular religion. And I just explained to you that this is a war of extremists and radicals, ideologues driven by a vision that is not-that hijacks religion in order to justify their position. And any chance we have to dispel false notion and to reinforce the realities is helpful to GPE and frankly others as well. And so that is the reason to name the envoy. It also is a clear signal that we respect nations and that we treat the NORP world seriously. And you can do that all different kinds of ways. It is another moment for people to see the seriousness of intent. In terms of-murder is murder, and murder to achieve political objectives is-needs to be stopped. People murdered NORP to achieve a political objective. There is a debate in our country whether that is true or not. I have made up my mind. I believe it is absolutely fundamentally true because I am listening to what the enemy says, the enemy of freedom, what they are saying. They say, We want a caliphate, we want to spread our vision. It took a military action, by the way, to liberate people from that vision in GPE. This was not an attack on ORG; this was an attack for liberty. Think about a society in which you CARDINAL could not function in what you are doing because of your gender. Because the vision of these people-who murder the innocent, by the way, to achieve their vision-is that women are not equal. And it just so happened that, given the way the world is DATE, that that kind of ideologue provided safe haven for people who plotted and killed people in our country. CARDINAL, I am not going to stand for it; I am going to protect GPE, just like any other leader would protect their own country. And CARDINAL, CARDINAL way to achieve long-term peace is to help people realize forms of government that give hope. And so whether it be in GPE and GPE, we are helping people realize the blessings of freedom. Freedom yields peace. Forms of government matter. And so the ambassador to the ORG or the President or any other representative of GPE will be expressing this deep desire to work together to achieve peace. ENTITY, what do you think you have achieved with regards to GPE ties with Asia during your time in office? In other words, we are making progress. The first step was to get people to the table, to remind people that it is just not GPE with responsibility. The purpose of the-getting all QUANTITY of us to the table is so that if GPE tried to say, Well, I am really-I said I was going to do it, but I am not going to do it, then there is somebody else also saying, And here are the consequences. And now it is beginning to work because they are verifiably beginning to shut down the reactor. And so we have got more to do. Unfinished is kind of a loaded word, in a way. But I am not-we are not in control of- we are in control of putting the process in place and making sure it is consequential if somebody does not go forward. But it is the leader of GPE who gets to the make the decision. I have made my choice. Let me reiterate a little bit of what I said earlier. The definition of successful foreign policy is to be in a position to work with others to solve problems. And this administration has worked hard to be in a position to convince others to work together to solve problems. I have just outlined some of the problems, some of the problems-whether or not trade is open and people are treated fairly. CARDINAL classic example of this is intellectual property rights. I know that is a deep concern to your Government, just like it is to all our governments, that if you are trading with a country, you want to make sure that those intellectual property rights are treated respectfully. And in some societies, it is difficult. And therefore, we have to be in a position to work collaboratively and bilaterally to convince countries that in order to be a part of the international world, you have to honor contract. And CARDINAL contract is, you do not steal somebody else's intellectual property. But nevertheless, those kind of relationships exist now; we are able to have those kind of dialogs. There is been a lot of cooperation on the security front in remarkable ways since I have been President. The leadership of your country knows full well the dangers of extremism prevailing and have been very strong in working, for example, on the Proliferation Security Initiative. This is an initiative where many ORG nations have agreed to help find and stop the shipment of materiels which could end up in the hands of extremists and radicals that could harm us. And it took a while to get this relationship in place. But it is a relationship that is necessary to help prevent weapons of mass destruction from being moved. And here is a classic case of a successful collaborative effort. The biggest danger we have, it seems like to me, is isolationism and protectionism becoming prevalent philosophies. CARDINAL of the things that this administration has done in working with our friends is to work hard to explain to people the beneficial nature of trading together. And therefore-and that is manifested, by the way, in, for example, the free trade agreement with GPE, which was not a given. And there were some difficulties to overcome in GPE and in GPE, but nevertheless, we got it done. And entering into free trade agreements with other nations, such as GPE, has been good ways of making sure that we codify the benefits of open trading relationships. And so there is been a lot of progress made, and the NORP issue is the issue that we are spending a lot of time on and, hopefully, we can get completed. Just to the domestic scene, we have got Federal elections, as you know, coming up in GPE. Last time around, you had some comments with regards to the then opposition leader's policies on GPE. You described his policy of withdrawal from GPE as disastrous. You have a one-on-CARDINAL meeting with the opposition leader, PERSON; he is ahead in the polls. He is also got a policy in GPE which talks about withdrawal, albeit with caveats. I am just wondering, what is your view of the opposition leader, PERSON? What will you discuss in the meeting? And what do you make of his GPE policy? Yes, first of all, I think it makes sense for me to reach out to leading political figures when I go to other countries. And so I am looking forward to this meeting. I do not know much about him, frankly. Obviously, I have not -maybe I met him; I do not remember meeting him. When I spoke to the Parliament-- I am going to remind him that, CARDINAL, the stakes in GPE are very high for peace; that the liberation of a country-that country was important for peace; and that a democracy-NORP-style democracy in the heart of the Middle East is part of winning this ideological struggle. So the first thing I am going to do is explain to him my views about this-the world in which we live. And I will remind him that, as far as I am concerned, that leaving GPE before the job is done will cause an enemy that attacked us before to become emboldened. And as PERSON put it, to think the enemy will stay there and not follow us here is- in other words, we leave before the job is done, they will follow us home. That-I will remind him that the best way to conduct policy is based upon conditions on the ground; that success is important; that conditions ought to be driving troop deployments. And that is how-I will tell him how-what I would hope all our coalition partners would view the situation in GPE and GPE. Having said that, I do appreciate very much the fact that the NORP have sacrificed and have served. And I am looking forward to seeing some NORP troops with Prime Minister PERSON to thank them and, as importantly, thank their families for joining GPE and a lot of other countries in the great cause of liberation and peace. It is going to be an interesting trip, and what is interesting about these trips is that the time around the table with leaders is important, but also the time sitting down with individuals is important as well. It is a good opportunity to conduct foreign policy. And as I told you, a lot of foreign policy, for me, is the capacity to just look at somebody in the eye and tell them what I think and listen to what they think. It is finding that common ground, if possible, to solve problems. And sometimes you can solve problems by anticipating them and putting the conditions in place so that they will not arise in the first place. And sometimes they just show up, and you better be in a position to deal with them. Can I just clarify something? PERSON is-his theater-he is talked about the importance of GPE, talking about withdrawing our troops from GPE. That he is determined to-he has determined that the issue on Afghanistan- to keep troops in GPE. I view both GPE and GPE as theaters of the same war against radicals and extremists and look forward to sharing my views with Mr. PERSON, of course, and continue our discussions, strategic discussions with PERSON. My next question would touch on NORP cleric PERSON. As you might know, since he was released from jail, has been exercising activities like any other citizens, including recently-DATE he inaugurated a long march participated by CARDINAL of his followers, in connection with that commemoration, or welcoming DATE NORP fasting DATE. Actually, how close has your Government monitored the activities of PERSON? First of all, I did not know he led a parade of CARDINAL people. So that may answer your first question. I am sure our Embassy is aware of the activities that take place in your country. I mean, you are a free country where people are allowed to express themselves in the public square, which is a sign of a healthy society. I am concerned, however, about anybody who preaches violence and extremism and radicalism in a world in which innocent people just get simply murdered for ideological purposes. There were some terrible murders in your country, as you know, just like in mine, and I am confident that by far the vast majority-all of GPE rejects that kind of behavior. Innocent people were killed in GPE for no other reason than they just happened to be vacationing and because somebody wanted to send a political message because they are involved with this ideological struggle. And those of us who want there to be peace have got to reject this kind of behavior. And so your Government is a government of law; your Government will conduct itself according to your laws. But anybody who preaches that kind of violence in the name of what I would call a dark political vision needs to be taken seriously. My next question is about the GPE relationship and the war on terror. The opposition party in GPE is threatening to cut the extension of NORP participation in the antiterrorism operations in the Indian Ocean. Are you concerned about that? And will you be-will you raise this issue when you will meet Prime Minister PERSON in GPE? First of all, GPE has been a positive contributor to dealing with the extremists in this ideological war. And I thank ORG and the people of GPE for their contributions. And I would hope that they would continue to maintain this-their positive influence. And of course, my conversations with Prime Minister PERSON, whom I respect a great deal, will center on the war on terror, as well as a lot of other key issues. GPE has played a significant role in many of the things we have discussed here, like Proliferation Security Initiative, CARDINAL-party talks. They have been a constructive partner in peace, and I will-we will talk about all aspects of our relationship. ENTITY, DATE,GPE celebrates its 50th-- Fiftieth-make sure my congratulatory remarks get in your article. PERSON Congratulates GPE. Do you think that is what it will say? It also marks the 50th relations between the GPE and GPE So what are your outlook and hopes for GPE relations, and especially with GPE being the 10th largest trading partner? First of all, I do believe we ought to have-take this notion of trade and have meaningful discussions with a potential free trade agreement with GPE. Secondly, I respect Prime Minister PERSON, admire his leadership. When his wife died, I tried to call him early just to let him know I cared about him. I will congratulate him. Do not put that in the article, that you had to tell me that. You can put it in there if you want. I will be glad to-I am going to congratulate him. You did congratulate him. I am going to congratulate him again. I will double the congratulations. That is right; I did write him a note. Did I call him or write him a note? You wrote him a note. Anyway, GPE is an interesting example of how a free society can deal with movements that could conceivably change and alter the nature of the free society. And I respect the way the Prime Minister has used freedom and used the openness of society to kind of deal with frustration. I mean, all societies have frustrated people. And the question is, will the outlet of that frustration lead to violence or lead to peace? And GPE is an example of a country where frustrations have been channeled in a constructive way. And therefore, he is a leader, as far as I am concerned, and a very constructive force for Southeast Asia. By the way, I am going to meet with the ORG leaders, which is an important meeting as well. It is an opportunity for GPE to stay very much engaged with ORG. I unfortunately will not be there for the 60th, but look forward to having an event that would kind of recognize the importance of ORG as far as GPE is concerned. So this is a side meeting with the ORG leaders after ORG meeting, sir? I try to do that every time. So they will have somebody like-I will sit down and meet with the ORG nations as well. The other thing that is interesting about GPE is, they are going to be one of the leaders on alternative fuels. I believe that it is in our interests that we develop the technologies necessary to deal with energy dependence as well as greenhouse gases. Back to the climate changes-the way-if you are truly interested in dealing with greenhouse gases, people need to focus on the development of technologies that will enable us to, on the CARDINAL hand, grow our economies, on the other hand, be good stewards of the environment. Just for the record-and this probably will not be a headline, although I have tried to make it one a lot-when it comes time to climate change, there is CARDINAL major industrialized nation that actually grew its economy and reduced greenhouse gases; that would be GPE that actually had greenhouse gases go down and the economy go up. So something is working here, and it is technologies, use of technologies. And so I am going to be reminding people about-that we can come up with a strategy that does not impoverish our people and, at the same time, takes advantage of technologies. And we are going to need to share some technologies with newly emerging economies in order to achieve this objective. Anyway, I forgot to make that point. I am not making the point to you, as you can tell. That is why I am kind of looking over your shoulder. There appears to be a perception in Southeast Asia that this administration has neglected the region. How do you plan to convince them otherwise when you meet in ORG? Well, I-do you want to ask another question, because I already answered it. I will be glad to answer it again- which is, we have got strong bilateral-first of all, the number of trips I have taken- I have gone to every ORG meeting. I have spent a lot of time with leaders both here and in your respective countries-that we have got relations to a point where we can work together to solve common problems. PSI is CARDINAL such example of a strategy we have implemented to deal with the realities of the world. And so it is -the truth of the matter is, I spend a lot of time working on NORP matters. And all I will ask you to do is look at the results of the individual relationships and the ability to put processes in place to deal with the threats we live in and the capacity to work together to solve problems and to create opportunities.

{"id": 12, "text": "I am looking forward to my trip. This is the seventh ORG summit that I have been to. I find them to be important for GPE in the following ways. CARDINAL, it is an opportunity to stress the importance that we place upon basic values, basic value of liberty, basic value of open markets in order to enhance prosperity. It is a chance to remind people that we are linked together. It is an interesting setting, when you have people from different cultures, different languages come together for a common purpose. It is also a chance for me to remind our country how important it is to have constructive ties in Asia. Asia is a place where we have spilt a lot of blood in the past, and now it is a place of peace. Asia is a place where GPE was engaged militarily, and now we are engaged culturally and socially and economically in a way that is constructive for our peoples. It will be an opportunity for-remind me that it is possible for enemies to be allies and for enemies to be friends. It is a lesson for a lot of us to think about when we think about the Middle East, that forms of government matter and hopeful societies yield peace. I am looking forward to the discussions about trade. The first priority for trade for me at the meeting will be on GPE. I am a firm believer in free trade. I believe the GPE round is the best opportunity for us to accomplish a couple of objectives. CARDINAL is to fight off protectionism and trade freely, and secondly is to help eliminate poverty. This will be an opportunity for the leaders of the ORG summit to express their desire to see the GPE round succeed. We will take the lead in that, along with other nations. There is also an opportunity for us to start talking about a free trade agreement of the Pacific region. And I am looking forward to having that dialog, begin the dialog. It would just be kind of an interesting opportunity to have the dialog on this aspect of our strategic partnership there and to move forward. We have got a lot of-we have got some free trade agreements with people, and that will be at the table. Opportunity for me to continue to talk about the struggle between radicalism and reasonableness, between extremism and people that want to live in peace. I happen to believe-I am sure you have heard me say this-that we are in a major ideological struggle-a struggle we will win, by the way. But it is going to require resolve and dedication. And this will be an opportunity for me to remind our friends at the table that this is the call of our time and that we have an opportunity to write a hopeful chapter here in DATE and to thank people around the table for understanding this is the call of the time, because there is been a lot of constructive engagement and good work, all aimed at protecting ourselves from short-term attack-in the short term from attack and recognizing that changing conditions of life in the long term will enable us to live in peace. And finally, I am looking forward to reminding people that I take the climate change issue seriously; that we recognize that there needs to be international-an international accord to get people at the table who are the major emitters to set a goal. Step CARDINAL to solving a problem is to set the goal on what we ought to achieve. If you want somebody to be a part of the problem-a part of the solution, you need to let them be a part of defining what the goal ought to be. So many of the people at the ORG table are going to come to the major economy conference that-those of us who are emitters will be there, including GPE, which will be at the table. I do not want to single GPE out, but GPE has got a major role to play. Any agreement without GPE is not going to be an effective agreement. So my strategy has been to get GPE at the table. We will further the dialog. PERSON has got some very interesting ways to further the dialog in a constructive way, particularly talking about energy usage. So we will be looking forward to his leadership on the issue. When I told him I was looking forward to coming, we discussed this issue. He is concerned about greenhouse gases. And so he will take the lead here at the conference, and GPE will play a constructive role. We have got a big agenda. It is my second trip to GPE. I remind people that GPE-parts of GPE reminds me of GPE--and there is no higher compliment. I think on behalf of all of us, I can say thank you very much for this opportunity DATE. As you have just analyzed, ENTITY, obviously GPE and the Middle East, the war on terror is an overarching policy issue for the PERSON administration. Nonetheless, there has been a perception in the region that this has distracted GPE from engagement in Asia. Some people are calling this the Pacific DATE. You are cutting short your trip to GPE because of the GPE issue. I am just wondering, do you think that is warranted, that criticism, and do you see GPE, for instance, playing the role-the driver in DATE, not the GPE? No, it is interesting, first of all, this administration has got good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE. Our relationship with the ORG countries are as strong as GPE has ever been, and of course our ties with GPE are tight, really tight. And the reason I say that is, is that this just does not happen without work. And I have worked hard to develop bilateral relations in such a way that we can achieve strategic objectives. I believe the relations with GPE and the Asian-Pacific region have never been better, and as a result, we are addressing problems and creating opportunities. CARDINAL problem, of course, is GPE. When I came into office, the world was expecting GPE to solve the GPE issue alone. To me-and the NORP leader had basically not honored the bilateral agreement that had been struck, and therefore, felt like we needed to put this issue in a position in which others were speaking besides GPE-and have started the CARDINAL-party talks. CARDINAL countries were convinced to come to the table on CARDINAL side to convince the NORP leader to give up his nuclear weapons ambitions. That would not have happened without engagement and good, solid relations. Another issue obviously is our bilateral relations with GPE. It is the same-you are in a little different position in that you have got a nice trade surplus with GPE. We have got a trade deficit with GPE. And it is important for us to have a-given the complexity of our relationship, that we have got a strategic relationship that allows for engagement and for us to help deal with a major trade deficit, for example, and/or product safety or a SARS outbreak. Secretary PERSON-I empowered Secretary PERSON to develop this special working relationship with GPE. And it requires a lot of engagement. It requires engagement at the top, with President PERSON, who I respect, as well as people in my ORG. For those who argue that, they really have not -frankly have not followed how engaged we have been. Is GPE an issue for the world? But I do not view it as a negative issue; I view it as an opportunity to work with a-one of the really significantly growing economies in the world. First, I view that a growing middle class in GPE is good for GPE exporters. It provides opportunity. And it is -by the way, it is not only good for GPE exports; it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP, NORP. Anybody who is making a product somebody wants, it is just a good opportunity. And so as a part of our engagement with GPE, we have worked with PERSON to convince him to help convert his economy from one of savers to one of consumers, which means-and by the way, that takes a lot of effort and work to get in a position where you can even make those kind of constructive suggestions-which means the development of a pension system or health care, so that people do not feel like they have to hoard their money to save for a rainy day, but in fact, there is some kind of safety net that is predictable, which then would convert a NORP person who is beginning to realize better income into a consumer. And then all of a sudden, you have got consumers, which provide opportunity. Huge economic opportunity-you see GPE as the big grower of the economy in the Asia Pacific? No, I see GPE as the big driver for trade. At ORG, people ought to be wondering whether or not PERSON is going to keep taxes low to make sure our economy continues to grow, because we are a significant trading partner. I view GPE as an opportunity. I think GPE is going to drive a lot of the trade. That is why we conducted-now, having said that, I think GPE will provide opportunity for NORP producers, but we also provide the same opportunity. I do not view it as a CARDINAL-sum game, let me put it to you that way. I view it as an-I view-all of us contribute, so long as the world does not slip into protectionism. And part of the reason one goes to ORG is to promote trade and opportunity. And how do you plan to win the hearts and win the markets in the world, including in NORP countries like GPE? Well, I think, first of all, we have a complex relationship with GPE. GPE strongly supports markets. On the other hand, we also support open societies, transparency, where people are allowed to express themselves in a free society. I believe in freedom of religion. I believe in basic freedoms. So our relationship with GPE is, on the CARDINAL hand, we welcome trading opportunities. And what makes the relationship even more complex is, at the same time, we believe in human rights and human dignity. And we worked with the NORP leadership to promote human rights and human dignity. So it is not-it is hard to define the relationship in kind of a simple, CARDINAL-sentence structure. As I told you, I view GPE as a positive opportunity. I like him; I like to talk to him. We can share issues together. And he can say to me, What are your problems? In other words, we have got a personal relationship. And that is the way I try to do with all leaders because the best diplomacy is when you can sit down with somebody one on CARDINAL and speak candidly about issues and problems. See, that is what leaders do. You see problems and you anticipate problems and work together to accomplish something. I have also got a very good relationship with your leader. And so bilateral relations-first of all, in the NORP world, it is very important for people to understand that the war on terror is not a war against NORP; it is a war against murderers. I do not believe religious people, truly religious people kill the innocent. And therefore, it is important for leaders and countries to work together to prevent the murder of the innocent and, at the same time, make sure that we respect-GPE, in my case, respects religion, values the right for people to worship, and, in the case of ORG, values ORG as an important part of the international scene in the world we live in. Yes, well, I am better for it. I have a question on GPE. Is it possible that GPE will give up nuclear weapons program by the end of your term? And to help achieve it, are you ready to remove GPE from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, even without the resolution of NORP abductee issue? As to the first part of your question, I certainly hope that GPE honors its agreements. They-in DATE, they made a substantial agreement to disclose and dismantle all aspects of a nuclear weapons program. And here we are in DATE, DATE, where we are still reminding them of that agreement. On the other hand, a lot has happened in DATE that would lead me to believe that we are on- we are making progress. And we will continue to push toward the full disclosure and dismantlement. Secondly, we have-different aspects of our relationship are on the table, but it is performance based. In other words, we expect people to honor their agreements. Finally, as I assured Prime Minister PERSON, that we are not going to forget the abductee issue. He and the NORP people are very concerned that once certain aspects of the agreement are achieved, that we will forget the fact that NORP citizens have been abducted. ENTITY. I will never forget the meeting I had with the mother-it is very important for your readers to know that that had a deep impression on me- the mother whose daughter was abducted by NORP. I cannot imagine what that would mean. I guess I can imagine what it would mean; I just cannot understand, fully understand the pain that she felt-still feels. And I will never forget her coming to FAC with the picture of that little girl, picture of her daughter who got abducted. She sat right there in FAC. And my point to you is, is that I am not going to forget the mother or forget the fact. And so we will work with the-continue to work with the NORP to make it clear to NORP that we also expect there to be resolution to this issue. In other words, I understand, as well as I possibly can, the emotion that people attach to this issue. But now that I am DATE, it is not that old. It is all in your mind. Sir, your administration has indicated interest to appoint a special envoy to the ORG of Islamic Conference, or the ORG. Have you identified the person? And what will he or she do to bridge relations with the NORP countries in the NORP world, in light of the war in GPE and in light of the detention of extremists from NORP countries? First of all, we have not identified the person yet. We are working toward that end. As a matter of fact, I spoke to the Secretary of ORG about this TIME, coincidentally enough. Anyway, we are working the issue. Secondly, the reason why I suggested- or announced that we are going to do this is because I am concerned about the perceptions in the NORP world that GPE views the war on terror as a war against a particular religion. And I just explained to you that this is a war of extremists and radicals, ideologues driven by a vision that is not-that hijacks religion in order to justify their position. And any chance we have to dispel false notion and to reinforce the realities is helpful to GPE and frankly others as well. And so that is the reason to name the envoy. It also is a clear signal that we respect nations and that we treat the NORP world seriously. And you can do that all different kinds of ways. It is another moment for people to see the seriousness of intent. In terms of-murder is murder, and murder to achieve political objectives is-needs to be stopped. People murdered NORP to achieve a political objective. There is a debate in our country whether that is true or not. I have made up my mind. I believe it is absolutely fundamentally true because I am listening to what the enemy says, the enemy of freedom, what they are saying. They say, We want a caliphate, we want to spread our vision. It took a military action, by the way, to liberate people from that vision in GPE. This was not an attack on ORG; this was an attack for liberty. Think about a society in which you CARDINAL could not function in what you are doing because of your gender. Because the vision of these people-who murder the innocent, by the way, to achieve their vision-is that women are not equal. And it just so happened that, given the way the world is DATE, that that kind of ideologue provided safe haven for people who plotted and killed people in our country. CARDINAL, I am not going to stand for it; I am going to protect GPE, just like any other leader would protect their own country. And CARDINAL, CARDINAL way to achieve long-term peace is to help people realize forms of government that give hope. And so whether it be in GPE and GPE, we are helping people realize the blessings of freedom. Freedom yields peace. Forms of government matter. And so the ambassador to the ORG or the President or any other representative of GPE will be expressing this deep desire to work together to achieve peace. ENTITY, what do you think you have achieved with regards to GPE ties with Asia during your time in office? In other words, we are making progress. The first step was to get people to the table, to remind people that it is just not GPE with responsibility. The purpose of the-getting all QUANTITY of us to the table is so that if GPE tried to say, Well, I am really-I said I was going to do it, but I am not going to do it, then there is somebody else also saying, And here are the consequences. And now it is beginning to work because they are verifiably beginning to shut down the reactor. And so we have got more to do. Unfinished is kind of a loaded word, in a way. But I am not-we are not in control of- we are in control of putting the process in place and making sure it is consequential if somebody does not go forward. But it is the leader of GPE who gets to the make the decision. I have made my choice. Let me reiterate a little bit of what I said earlier. The definition of successful foreign policy is to be in a position to work with others to solve problems. And this administration has worked hard to be in a position to convince others to work together to solve problems. I have just outlined some of the problems, some of the problems-whether or not trade is open and people are treated fairly. CARDINAL classic example of this is intellectual property rights. I know that is a deep concern to your Government, just like it is to all our governments, that if you are trading with a country, you want to make sure that those intellectual property rights are treated respectfully. And in some societies, it is difficult. And therefore, we have to be in a position to work collaboratively and bilaterally to convince countries that in order to be a part of the international world, you have to honor contract. And CARDINAL contract is, you do not steal somebody else's intellectual property. But nevertheless, those kind of relationships exist now; we are able to have those kind of dialogs. There is been a lot of cooperation on the security front in remarkable ways since I have been President. The leadership of your country knows full well the dangers of extremism prevailing and have been very strong in working, for example, on the Proliferation Security Initiative. This is an initiative where many ORG nations have agreed to help find and stop the shipment of materiels which could end up in the hands of extremists and radicals that could harm us. And it took a while to get this relationship in place. But it is a relationship that is necessary to help prevent weapons of mass destruction from being moved. And here is a classic case of a successful collaborative effort. The biggest danger we have, it seems like to me, is isolationism and protectionism becoming prevalent philosophies. CARDINAL of the things that this administration has done in working with our friends is to work hard to explain to people the beneficial nature of trading together. And therefore-and that is manifested, by the way, in, for example, the free trade agreement with GPE, which was not a given. And there were some difficulties to overcome in GPE and in GPE, but nevertheless, we got it done. And entering into free trade agreements with other nations, such as GPE, has been good ways of making sure that we codify the benefits of open trading relationships. And so there is been a lot of progress made, and the NORP issue is the issue that we are spending a lot of time on and, hopefully, we can get completed. Just to the domestic scene, we have got Federal elections, as you know, coming up in GPE. Last time around, you had some comments with regards to the then opposition leader's policies on GPE. You described his policy of withdrawal from GPE as disastrous. You have a one-on-CARDINAL meeting with the opposition leader, PERSON; he is ahead in the polls. He is also got a policy in GPE which talks about withdrawal, albeit with caveats. I am just wondering, what is your view of the opposition leader, PERSON? What will you discuss in the meeting? And what do you make of his GPE policy? Yes, first of all, I think it makes sense for me to reach out to leading political figures when I go to other countries. And so I am looking forward to this meeting. I do not know much about him, frankly. Obviously, I have not -maybe I met him; I do not remember meeting him. When I spoke to the Parliament-- I am going to remind him that, CARDINAL, the stakes in GPE are very high for peace; that the liberation of a country-that country was important for peace; and that a democracy-NORP-style democracy in the heart of the Middle East is part of winning this ideological struggle. So the first thing I am going to do is explain to him my views about this-the world in which we live. And I will remind him that, as far as I am concerned, that leaving GPE before the job is done will cause an enemy that attacked us before to become emboldened. And as PERSON put it, to think the enemy will stay there and not follow us here is- in other words, we leave before the job is done, they will follow us home. That-I will remind him that the best way to conduct policy is based upon conditions on the ground; that success is important; that conditions ought to be driving troop deployments. And that is how-I will tell him how-what I would hope all our coalition partners would view the situation in GPE and GPE. Having said that, I do appreciate very much the fact that the NORP have sacrificed and have served. And I am looking forward to seeing some NORP troops with Prime Minister PERSON to thank them and, as importantly, thank their families for joining GPE and a lot of other countries in the great cause of liberation and peace. It is going to be an interesting trip, and what is interesting about these trips is that the time around the table with leaders is important, but also the time sitting down with individuals is important as well. It is a good opportunity to conduct foreign policy. And as I told you, a lot of foreign policy, for me, is the capacity to just look at somebody in the eye and tell them what I think and listen to what they think. It is finding that common ground, if possible, to solve problems. And sometimes you can solve problems by anticipating them and putting the conditions in place so that they will not arise in the first place. And sometimes they just show up, and you better be in a position to deal with them. Can I just clarify something? PERSON is-his theater-he is talked about the importance of GPE, talking about withdrawing our troops from GPE. That he is determined to-he has determined that the issue on Afghanistan- to keep troops in GPE. I view both GPE and GPE as theaters of the same war against radicals and extremists and look forward to sharing my views with Mr. PERSON, of course, and continue our discussions, strategic discussions with PERSON. My next question would touch on NORP cleric PERSON. As you might know, since he was released from jail, has been exercising activities like any other citizens, including recently-DATE he inaugurated a long march participated by CARDINAL of his followers, in connection with that commemoration, or welcoming DATE NORP fasting DATE. Actually, how close has your Government monitored the activities of PERSON? First of all, I did not know he led a parade of CARDINAL people. So that may answer your first question. I am sure our Embassy is aware of the activities that take place in your country. I mean, you are a free country where people are allowed to express themselves in the public square, which is a sign of a healthy society. I am concerned, however, about anybody who preaches violence and extremism and radicalism in a world in which innocent people just get simply murdered for ideological purposes. There were some terrible murders in your country, as you know, just like in mine, and I am confident that by far the vast majority-all of GPE rejects that kind of behavior. Innocent people were killed in GPE for no other reason than they just happened to be vacationing and because somebody wanted to send a political message because they are involved with this ideological struggle. And those of us who want there to be peace have got to reject this kind of behavior. And so your Government is a government of law; your Government will conduct itself according to your laws. But anybody who preaches that kind of violence in the name of what I would call a dark political vision needs to be taken seriously. My next question is about the GPE relationship and the war on terror. The opposition party in GPE is threatening to cut the extension of NORP participation in the antiterrorism operations in the Indian Ocean. Are you concerned about that? And will you be-will you raise this issue when you will meet Prime Minister PERSON in GPE? First of all, GPE has been a positive contributor to dealing with the extremists in this ideological war. And I thank ORG and the people of GPE for their contributions. And I would hope that they would continue to maintain this-their positive influence. And of course, my conversations with Prime Minister PERSON, whom I respect a great deal, will center on the war on terror, as well as a lot of other key issues. GPE has played a significant role in many of the things we have discussed here, like Proliferation Security Initiative, CARDINAL-party talks. They have been a constructive partner in peace, and I will-we will talk about all aspects of our relationship. ENTITY, DATE,GPE celebrates its 50th-- Fiftieth-make sure my congratulatory remarks get in your article. PERSON Congratulates GPE. Do you think that is what it will say? It also marks the 50th relations between the GPE and GPE So what are your outlook and hopes for GPE relations, and especially with GPE being the 10th largest trading partner? First of all, I do believe we ought to have-take this notion of trade and have meaningful discussions with a potential free trade agreement with GPE. Secondly, I respect Prime Minister PERSON, admire his leadership. When his wife died, I tried to call him early just to let him know I cared about him. I will congratulate him. Do not put that in the article, that you had to tell me that. You can put it in there if you want. I will be glad to-I am going to congratulate him. You did congratulate him. I am going to congratulate him again. I will double the congratulations. That is right; I did write him a note. Did I call him or write him a note? You wrote him a note. Anyway, GPE is an interesting example of how a free society can deal with movements that could conceivably change and alter the nature of the free society. And I respect the way the Prime Minister has used freedom and used the openness of society to kind of deal with frustration. I mean, all societies have frustrated people. And the question is, will the outlet of that frustration lead to violence or lead to peace? And GPE is an example of a country where frustrations have been channeled in a constructive way. And therefore, he is a leader, as far as I am concerned, and a very constructive force for Southeast Asia. By the way, I am going to meet with the ORG leaders, which is an important meeting as well. It is an opportunity for GPE to stay very much engaged with ORG. I unfortunately will not be there for the 60th, but look forward to having an event that would kind of recognize the importance of ORG as far as GPE is concerned. So this is a side meeting with the ORG leaders after ORG meeting, sir? I try to do that every time. So they will have somebody like-I will sit down and meet with the ORG nations as well. The other thing that is interesting about GPE is, they are going to be one of the leaders on alternative fuels. I believe that it is in our interests that we develop the technologies necessary to deal with energy dependence as well as greenhouse gases. Back to the climate changes-the way-if you are truly interested in dealing with greenhouse gases, people need to focus on the development of technologies that will enable us to, on the CARDINAL hand, grow our economies, on the other hand, be good stewards of the environment. Just for the record-and this probably will not be a headline, although I have tried to make it one a lot-when it comes time to climate change, there is CARDINAL major industrialized nation that actually grew its economy and reduced greenhouse gases; that would be GPE that actually had greenhouse gases go down and the economy go up. So something is working here, and it is technologies, use of technologies. And so I am going to be reminding people about-that we can come up with a strategy that does not impoverish our people and, at the same time, takes advantage of technologies. And we are going to need to share some technologies with newly emerging economies in order to achieve this objective. Anyway, I forgot to make that point. I am not making the point to you, as you can tell. That is why I am kind of looking over your shoulder. There appears to be a perception in Southeast Asia that this administration has neglected the region. How do you plan to convince them otherwise when you meet in ORG? Well, I-do you want to ask another question, because I already answered it. I will be glad to answer it again- which is, we have got strong bilateral-first of all, the number of trips I have taken- I have gone to every ORG meeting. I have spent a lot of time with leaders both here and in your respective countries-that we have got relations to a point where we can work together to solve common problems. PSI is CARDINAL such example of a strategy we have implemented to deal with the realities of the world. And so it is -the truth of the matter is, I spend a lot of time working on NORP matters. And all I will ask you to do is look at the results of the individual relationships and the ability to put processes in place to deal with the threats we live in and the capacity to work together to solve problems and to create opportunities. And to me, that is a sign of a healthy, robust relationship with an important part of the world.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintmedia0", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Media", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-media-0", "publication_date": "30-08-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

I do not want to single GPE out, but GPE has got a major role to play. Any agreement without GPE is not going to be an effective agreement. So my strategy has been to get GPE at the table. We will further the dialog. PERSON has got some very interesting ways to further the dialog in a constructive way, particularly talking about energy usage. So we will be looking forward to his leadership on the issue. When I told him I was looking forward to coming, we discussed this issue. He is concerned about greenhouse gases. And so he will take the lead here at the conference, and GPE will play a constructive role. We have got a big agenda. It is my second trip to GPE. I remind people that GPE-parts of GPE reminds me of GPE--and there is no higher compliment. I think on behalf of all of us, I can say thank you very much for this opportunity DATE. As you have just analyzed, ENTITY, obviously GPE and the Middle East, the war on terror is an overarching policy issue for the PERSON administration. Nonetheless, there has been a perception in the region that this has distracted GPE from engagement in Asia. Some people are calling this the Pacific DATE. You are cutting short your trip to GPE because of the GPE issue. I am just wondering, do you think that is warranted, that criticism, and do you see GPE, for instance, playing the role-the driver in DATE, not the GPE? No, it is interesting, first of all, this administration has got good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE. Our relationship with the ORG countries are as strong as GPE has ever been, and of course our ties with GPE are tight, really tight. And the reason I say that is, is that this just does not happen without work. And I have worked hard to develop bilateral relations in such a way that we can achieve strategic objectives. I believe the relations with GPE and the Asian-Pacific region have never been better, and as a result, we are addressing problems and creating opportunities. CARDINAL problem, of course, is GPE. When I came into office, the world was expecting GPE to solve the GPE issue alone. To me-and the NORP leader had basically not honored the bilateral agreement that had been struck, and therefore, felt like we needed to put this issue in a position in which others were speaking besides GPE-and have started the CARDINAL-party talks. CARDINAL countries were convinced to come to the table on CARDINAL side to convince the NORP leader to give up his nuclear weapons ambitions. That would not have happened without engagement and good, solid relations. Another issue obviously is our bilateral relations with GPE. It is the same-you are in a little different position in that you have got a nice trade surplus with GPE. We have got a trade deficit with GPE. And it is important for us to have a-given the complexity of our relationship, that we have got a strategic relationship that allows for engagement and for us to help deal with a major trade deficit, for example, and/or product safety or a SARS outbreak. Secretary PERSON-I empowered Secretary PERSON to develop this special working relationship with GPE. And it requires a lot of engagement. It requires engagement at the top, with President PERSON, who I respect, as well as people in my ORG. For those who argue that, they really have not -frankly have not followed how engaged we have been. Is GPE an issue for the world? But I do not view it as a negative issue; I view it as an opportunity to work with a-one of the really significantly growing economies in the world. First, I view that a growing middle class in GPE is good for GPE exporters. It provides opportunity. And it is -by the way, it is not only good for GPE exports; it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP, NORP. Anybody who is making a product somebody wants, it is just a good opportunity. And so as a part of our engagement with GPE, we have worked with PERSON to convince him to help convert his economy from one of savers to one of consumers, which means-and by the way, that takes a lot of effort and work to get in a position where you can even make those kind of constructive suggestions-which means the development of a pension system or health care, so that people do not feel like they have to hoard their money to save for a rainy day, but in fact, there is some kind of safety net that is predictable, which then would convert a NORP person who is beginning to realize better income into a consumer. And then all of a sudden, you have got consumers, which provide opportunity. Huge economic opportunity-you see GPE as the big grower of the economy in the Asia Pacific? No, I see GPE as the big driver for trade. At ORG, people ought to be wondering whether or not PERSON is going to keep taxes low to make sure our economy continues to grow, because we are a significant trading partner. I view GPE as an opportunity. I think GPE is going to drive a lot of the trade. That is why we conducted-now, having said that, I think GPE will provide opportunity for NORP producers, but we also provide the same opportunity. I do not view it as a CARDINAL-sum game, let me put it to you that way. I view it as an-I view-all of us contribute, so long as the world does not slip into protectionism. And part of the reason one goes to ORG is to promote trade and opportunity. And how do you plan to win the hearts and win the markets in the world, including in NORP countries like GPE? Well, I think, first of all, we have a complex relationship with GPE. GPE strongly supports markets. On the other hand, we also support open societies, transparency, where people are allowed to express themselves in a free society. I believe in freedom of religion. I believe in basic freedoms. So our relationship with GPE is, on the CARDINAL hand, we welcome trading opportunities. And what makes the relationship even more complex is, at the same time, we believe in human rights and human dignity. And we worked with the NORP leadership to promote human rights and human dignity. So it is not-it is hard to define the relationship in kind of a simple, CARDINAL-sentence structure. As I told you, I view GPE as a positive opportunity. I like him; I like to talk to him. We can share issues together. And he can say to me, What are your problems? In other words, we have got a personal relationship. And that is the way I try to do with all leaders because the best diplomacy is when you can sit down with somebody one on CARDINAL and speak candidly about issues and problems. See, that is what leaders do. You see problems and you anticipate problems and work together to accomplish something. I have also got a very good relationship with your leader. And so bilateral relations-first of all, in the NORP world, it is very important for people to understand that the war on terror is not a war against NORP; it is a war against murderers. I do not believe religious people, truly religious people kill the innocent. And therefore, it is important for leaders and countries to work together to prevent the murder of the innocent and, at the same time, make sure that we respect-GPE, in my case, respects religion, values the right for people to worship, and, in the case of ORG, values ORG as an important part of the international scene in the world we live in. Yes, well, I am better for it. I have a question on GPE. Is it possible that GPE will give up nuclear weapons program by the end of your term? And to help achieve it, are you ready to remove GPE from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, even without the resolution of NORP abductee issue? As to the first part of your question, I certainly hope that GPE honors its agreements. They-in DATE, they made a substantial agreement to disclose and dismantle all aspects of a nuclear weapons program. And here we are in DATE, DATE, where we are still reminding them of that agreement. On the other hand, a lot has happened in DATE that would lead me to believe that we are on- we are making progress. And we will continue to push toward the full disclosure and dismantlement. Secondly, we have-different aspects of our relationship are on the table, but it is performance based. In other words, we expect people to honor their agreements. Finally, as I assured Prime Minister PERSON, that we are not going to forget the abductee issue. He and the NORP people are very concerned that once certain aspects of the agreement are achieved, that we will forget the fact that NORP citizens have been abducted. ENTITY. I will never forget the meeting I had with the mother-it is very important for your readers to know that that had a deep impression on me- the mother whose daughter was abducted by NORP. I cannot imagine what that would mean. I guess I can imagine what it would mean; I just cannot understand, fully understand the pain that she felt-still feels. And I will never forget her coming to FAC with the picture of that little girl, picture of her daughter who got abducted. She sat right there in FAC. And my point to you is, is that I am not going to forget the mother or forget the fact. And so we will work with the-continue to work with the NORP to make it clear to NORP that we also expect there to be resolution to this issue. In other words, I understand, as well as I possibly can, the emotion that people attach to this issue. But now that I am DATE, it is not that old. It is all in your mind. Sir, your administration has indicated interest to appoint a special envoy to the ORG of Islamic Conference, or the ORG. Have you identified the person? And what will he or she do to bridge relations with the NORP countries in the NORP world, in light of the war in GPE and in light of the detention of extremists from NORP countries? First of all, we have not identified the person yet. We are working toward that end. As a matter of fact, I spoke to the Secretary of ORG about this TIME, coincidentally enough. Anyway, we are working the issue. Secondly, the reason why I suggested- or announced that we are going to do this is because I am concerned about the perceptions in the NORP world that GPE views the war on terror as a war against a particular religion. And I just explained to you that this is a war of extremists and radicals, ideologues driven by a vision that is not-that hijacks religion in order to justify their position. And any chance we have to dispel false notion and to reinforce the realities is helpful to GPE and frankly others as well. And so that is the reason to name the envoy. It also is a clear signal that we respect nations and that we treat the NORP world seriously. And you can do that all different kinds of ways. It is another moment for people to see the seriousness of intent. In terms of-murder is murder, and murder to achieve political objectives is-needs to be stopped. People murdered NORP to achieve a political objective. There is a debate in our country whether that is true or not. I have made up my mind. I believe it is absolutely fundamentally true because I am listening to what the enemy says, the enemy of freedom, what they are saying. They say, We want a caliphate, we want to spread our vision. It took a military action, by the way, to liberate people from that vision in GPE. This was not an attack on ORG; this was an attack for liberty. Think about a society in which you CARDINAL could not function in what you are doing because of your gender. Because the vision of these people-who murder the innocent, by the way, to achieve their vision-is that women are not equal. And it just so happened that, given the way the world is DATE, that that kind of ideologue provided safe haven for people who plotted and killed people in our country. CARDINAL, I am not going to stand for it; I am going to protect GPE, just like any other leader would protect their own country. And CARDINAL, CARDINAL way to achieve long-term peace is to help people realize forms of government that give hope. And so whether it be in GPE and GPE, we are helping people realize the blessings of freedom. Freedom yields peace. Forms of government matter. And so the ambassador to the ORG or the President or any other representative of GPE will be expressing this deep desire to work together to achieve peace. ENTITY, what do you think you have achieved with regards to GPE ties with Asia during your time in office? In other words, we are making progress. The first step was to get people to the table, to remind people that it is just not GPE with responsibility. The purpose of the-getting all QUANTITY of us to the table is so that if GPE tried to say, Well, I am really-I said I was going to do it, but I am not going to do it, then there is somebody else also saying, And here are the consequences. And now it is beginning to work because they are verifiably beginning to shut down the reactor. And so we have got more to do. Unfinished is kind of a loaded word, in a way. But I am not-we are not in control of- we are in control of putting the process in place and making sure it is consequential if somebody does not go forward. But it is the leader of GPE who gets to the make the decision. I have made my choice. Let me reiterate a little bit of what I said earlier. The definition of successful foreign policy is to be in a position to work with others to solve problems. And this administration has worked hard to be in a position to convince others to work together to solve problems. I have just outlined some of the problems, some of the problems-whether or not trade is open and people are treated fairly. CARDINAL classic example of this is intellectual property rights. I know that is a deep concern to your Government, just like it is to all our governments, that if you are trading with a country, you want to make sure that those intellectual property rights are treated respectfully. And in some societies, it is difficult. And therefore, we have to be in a position to work collaboratively and bilaterally to convince countries that in order to be a part of the international world, you have to honor contract. And CARDINAL contract is, you do not steal somebody else's intellectual property. But nevertheless, those kind of relationships exist now; we are able to have those kind of dialogs. There is been a lot of cooperation on the security front in remarkable ways since I have been President. The leadership of your country knows full well the dangers of extremism prevailing and have been very strong in working, for example, on the Proliferation Security Initiative. This is an initiative where many ORG nations have agreed to help find and stop the shipment of materiels which could end up in the hands of extremists and radicals that could harm us. And it took a while to get this relationship in place. But it is a relationship that is necessary to help prevent weapons of mass destruction from being moved. And here is a classic case of a successful collaborative effort. The biggest danger we have, it seems like to me, is isolationism and protectionism becoming prevalent philosophies. CARDINAL of the things that this administration has done in working with our friends is to work hard to explain to people the beneficial nature of trading together. And therefore-and that is manifested, by the way, in, for example, the free trade agreement with GPE, which was not a given. And there were some difficulties to overcome in GPE and in GPE, but nevertheless, we got it done. And entering into free trade agreements with other nations, such as GPE, has been good ways of making sure that we codify the benefits of open trading relationships. And so there is been a lot of progress made, and the NORP issue is the issue that we are spending a lot of time on and, hopefully, we can get completed. Just to the domestic scene, we have got Federal elections, as you know, coming up in GPE. Last time around, you had some comments with regards to the then opposition leader's policies on GPE. You described his policy of withdrawal from GPE as disastrous. You have a one-on-CARDINAL meeting with the opposition leader, PERSON; he is ahead in the polls. He is also got a policy in GPE which talks about withdrawal, albeit with caveats. I am just wondering, what is your view of the opposition leader, PERSON? What will you discuss in the meeting? And what do you make of his GPE policy? Yes, first of all, I think it makes sense for me to reach out to leading political figures when I go to other countries. And so I am looking forward to this meeting. I do not know much about him, frankly. Obviously, I have not -maybe I met him; I do not remember meeting him. When I spoke to the Parliament-- I am going to remind him that, CARDINAL, the stakes in GPE are very high for peace; that the liberation of a country-that country was important for peace; and that a democracy-NORP-style democracy in the heart of the Middle East is part of winning this ideological struggle. So the first thing I am going to do is explain to him my views about this-the world in which we live. And I will remind him that, as far as I am concerned, that leaving GPE before the job is done will cause an enemy that attacked us before to become emboldened. And as PERSON put it, to think the enemy will stay there and not follow us here is- in other words, we leave before the job is done, they will follow us home. That-I will remind him that the best way to conduct policy is based upon conditions on the ground; that success is important; that conditions ought to be driving troop deployments. And that is how-I will tell him how-what I would hope all our coalition partners would view the situation in GPE and GPE. Having said that, I do appreciate very much the fact that the NORP have sacrificed and have served. And I am looking forward to seeing some NORP troops with Prime Minister PERSON to thank them and, as importantly, thank their families for joining GPE and a lot of other countries in the great cause of liberation and peace. It is going to be an interesting trip, and what is interesting about these trips is that the time around the table with leaders is important, but also the time sitting down with individuals is important as well. It is a good opportunity to conduct foreign policy. And as I told you, a lot of foreign policy, for me, is the capacity to just look at somebody in the eye and tell them what I think and listen to what they think. It is finding that common ground, if possible, to solve problems. And sometimes you can solve problems by anticipating them and putting the conditions in place so that they will not arise in the first place. And sometimes they just show up, and you better be in a position to deal with them. Can I just clarify something? PERSON is-his theater-he is talked about the importance of GPE, talking about withdrawing our troops from GPE. That he is determined to-he has determined that the issue on Afghanistan- to keep troops in GPE. I view both GPE and GPE as theaters of the same war against radicals and extremists and look forward to sharing my views with Mr. PERSON, of course, and continue our discussions, strategic discussions with PERSON. My next question would touch on NORP cleric PERSON. As you might know, since he was released from jail, has been exercising activities like any other citizens, including recently-DATE he inaugurated a long march participated by CARDINAL of his followers, in connection with that commemoration, or welcoming DATE NORP fasting DATE. Actually, how close has your Government monitored the activities of PERSON? First of all, I did not know he led a parade of CARDINAL people. So that may answer your first question. I am sure our Embassy is aware of the activities that take place in your country. I mean, you are a free country where people are allowed to express themselves in the public square, which is a sign of a healthy society. I am concerned, however, about anybody who preaches violence and extremism and radicalism in a world in which innocent people just get simply murdered for ideological purposes. There were some terrible murders in your country, as you know, just like in mine, and I am confident that by far the vast majority-all of GPE rejects that kind of behavior. Innocent people were killed in GPE for no other reason than they just happened to be vacationing and because somebody wanted to send a political message because they are involved with this ideological struggle. And those of us who want there to be peace have got to reject this kind of behavior. And so your Government is a government of law; your Government will conduct itself according to your laws. But anybody who preaches that kind of violence in the name of what I would call a dark political vision needs to be taken seriously. My next question is about the GPE relationship and the war on terror. The opposition party in GPE is threatening to cut the extension of NORP participation in the antiterrorism operations in the Indian Ocean. Are you concerned about that? And will you be-will you raise this issue when you will meet Prime Minister PERSON in GPE? First of all, GPE has been a positive contributor to dealing with the extremists in this ideological war. And I thank ORG and the people of GPE for their contributions. And I would hope that they would continue to maintain this-their positive influence. And of course, my conversations with Prime Minister PERSON, whom I respect a great deal, will center on the war on terror, as well as a lot of other key issues. GPE has played a significant role in many of the things we have discussed here, like Proliferation Security Initiative, CARDINAL-party talks. They have been a constructive partner in peace, and I will-we will talk about all aspects of our relationship. ENTITY, DATE,GPE celebrates its 50th-- Fiftieth-make sure my congratulatory remarks get in your article. PERSON Congratulates GPE. Do you think that is what it will say? It also marks the 50th relations between the GPE and GPE So what are your outlook and hopes for GPE relations, and especially with GPE being the 10th largest trading partner? First of all, I do believe we ought to have-take this notion of trade and have meaningful discussions with a potential free trade agreement with GPE. Secondly, I respect Prime Minister PERSON, admire his leadership. When his wife died, I tried to call him early just to let him know I cared about him. I will congratulate him. Do not put that in the article, that you had to tell me that. You can put it in there if you want. I will be glad to-I am going to congratulate him. You did congratulate him. I am going to congratulate him again. I will double the congratulations. That is right; I did write him a note. Did I call him or write him a note? You wrote him a note. Anyway, GPE is an interesting example of how a free society can deal with movements that could conceivably change and alter the nature of the free society. And I respect the way the Prime Minister has used freedom and used the openness of society to kind of deal with frustration. I mean, all societies have frustrated people. And the question is, will the outlet of that frustration lead to violence or lead to peace? And GPE is an example of a country where frustrations have been channeled in a constructive way. And therefore, he is a leader, as far as I am concerned, and a very constructive force for Southeast Asia. By the way, I am going to meet with the ORG leaders, which is an important meeting as well. It is an opportunity for GPE to stay very much engaged with ORG. I unfortunately will not be there for the 60th, but look forward to having an event that would kind of recognize the importance of ORG as far as GPE is concerned. So this is a side meeting with the ORG leaders after ORG meeting, sir? I try to do that every time. So they will have somebody like-I will sit down and meet with the ORG nations as well. The other thing that is interesting about GPE is, they are going to be one of the leaders on alternative fuels. I believe that it is in our interests that we develop the technologies necessary to deal with energy dependence as well as greenhouse gases. Back to the climate changes-the way-if you are truly interested in dealing with greenhouse gases, people need to focus on the development of technologies that will enable us to, on the CARDINAL hand, grow our economies, on the other hand, be good stewards of the environment. Just for the record-and this probably will not be a headline, although I have tried to make it one a lot-when it comes time to climate change, there is CARDINAL major industrialized nation that actually grew its economy and reduced greenhouse gases; that would be GPE that actually had greenhouse gases go down and the economy go up. So something is working here, and it is technologies, use of technologies. And so I am going to be reminding people about-that we can come up with a strategy that does not impoverish our people and, at the same time, takes advantage of technologies. And we are going to need to share some technologies with newly emerging economies in order to achieve this objective. Anyway, I forgot to make that point. I am not making the point to you, as you can tell. That is why I am kind of looking over your shoulder. There appears to be a perception in Southeast Asia that this administration has neglected the region. How do you plan to convince them otherwise when you meet in ORG? Well, I-do you want to ask another question, because I already answered it. I will be glad to answer it again- which is, we have got strong bilateral-first of all, the number of trips I have taken- I have gone to every ORG meeting. I have spent a lot of time with leaders both here and in your respective countries-that we have got relations to a point where we can work together to solve common problems. PSI is CARDINAL such example of a strategy we have implemented to deal with the realities of the world. And so it is -the truth of the matter is, I spend a lot of time working on NORP matters. And all I will ask you to do is look at the results of the individual relationships and the ability to put processes in place to deal with the threats we live in and the capacity to work together to solve problems and to create opportunities. And to me, that is a sign of a healthy, robust relationship with an important part of the world.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintmedia0", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Media", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-media-0", "publication_date": "30-08-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 12, "text": "I am looking forward to my trip. This is the seventh ORG summit that I have been to. I find them to be important for GPE in the following ways. CARDINAL, it is an opportunity to stress the importance that we place upon basic values, basic value of liberty, basic value of open markets in order to enhance prosperity. It is a chance to remind people that we are linked together. It is an interesting setting, when you have people from different cultures, different languages come together for a common purpose. It is also a chance for me to remind our country how important it is to have constructive ties in Asia. Asia is a place where we have spilt a lot of blood in the past, and now it is a place of peace. Asia is a place where GPE was engaged militarily, and now we are engaged culturally and socially and economically in a way that is constructive for our peoples. It will be an opportunity for-remind me that it is possible for enemies to be allies and for enemies to be friends. It is a lesson for a lot of us to think about when we think about the Middle East, that forms of government matter and hopeful societies yield peace. I am looking forward to the discussions about trade. The first priority for trade for me at the meeting will be on GPE. I am a firm believer in free trade. I believe the GPE round is the best opportunity for us to accomplish a couple of objectives. CARDINAL is to fight off protectionism and trade freely, and secondly is to help eliminate poverty. This will be an opportunity for the leaders of the ORG summit to express their desire to see the GPE round succeed. We will take the lead in that, along with other nations. There is also an opportunity for us to start talking about a free trade agreement of the Pacific region. And I am looking forward to having that dialog, begin the dialog. It would just be kind of an interesting opportunity to have the dialog on this aspect of our strategic partnership there and to move forward. We have got a lot of-we have got some free trade agreements with people, and that will be at the table. Opportunity for me to continue to talk about the struggle between radicalism and reasonableness, between extremism and people that want to live in peace. I happen to believe-I am sure you have heard me say this-that we are in a major ideological struggle-a struggle we will win, by the way. But it is going to require resolve and dedication. And this will be an opportunity for me to remind our friends at the table that this is the call of our time and that we have an opportunity to write a hopeful chapter here in DATE and to thank people around the table for understanding this is the call of the time, because there is been a lot of constructive engagement and good work, all aimed at protecting ourselves from short-term attack-in the short term from attack and recognizing that changing conditions of life in the long term will enable us to live in peace. And finally, I am looking forward to reminding people that I take the climate change issue seriously; that we recognize that there needs to be international-an international accord to get people at the table who are the major emitters to set a goal. Step CARDINAL to solving a problem is to set the goal on what we ought to achieve. If you want somebody to be a part of the problem-a part of the solution, you need to let them be a part of defining what the goal ought to be. So many of the people at the ORG table are going to come to the major economy conference that-those of us who are emitters will be there, including GPE, which will be at the table. I do not want to single GPE out, but GPE has got a major role to play. Any agreement without GPE is not going to be an effective agreement. So my strategy has been to get GPE at the table. We will further the dialog. PERSON has got some very interesting ways to further the dialog in a constructive way, particularly talking about energy usage. So we will be looking forward to his leadership on the issue. When I told him I was looking forward to coming, we discussed this issue. He is concerned about greenhouse gases. And so he will take the lead here at the conference, and GPE will play a constructive role. We have got a big agenda. It is my second trip to GPE. I remind people that GPE-parts of GPE reminds me of GPE--and there is no higher compliment. I think on behalf of all of us, I can say thank you very much for this opportunity DATE. As you have just analyzed, ENTITY, obviously GPE and the Middle East, the war on terror is an overarching policy issue for the PERSON administration. Nonetheless, there has been a perception in the region that this has distracted GPE from engagement in Asia. Some people are calling this the Pacific DATE. You are cutting short your trip to GPE because of the GPE issue. I am just wondering, do you think that is warranted, that criticism, and do you see GPE, for instance, playing the role-the driver in DATE, not the GPE? No, it is interesting, first of all, this administration has got good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE. Our relationship with the ORG countries are as strong as GPE has ever been, and of course our ties with GPE are tight, really tight. And the reason I say that is, is that this just does not happen without work. And I have worked hard to develop bilateral relations in such a way that we can achieve strategic objectives. I believe the relations with GPE and the Asian-Pacific region have never been better, and as a result, we are addressing problems and creating opportunities. CARDINAL problem, of course, is GPE. When I came into office, the world was expecting GPE to solve the GPE issue alone. To me-and the NORP leader had basically not honored the bilateral agreement that had been struck, and therefore, felt like we needed to put this issue in a position in which others were speaking besides GPE-and have started the CARDINAL-party talks. CARDINAL countries were convinced to come to the table on CARDINAL side to convince the NORP leader to give up his nuclear weapons ambitions. That would not have happened without engagement and good, solid relations. Another issue obviously is our bilateral relations with GPE. It is the same-you are in a little different position in that you have got a nice trade surplus with GPE. We have got a trade deficit with GPE. And it is important for us to have a-given the complexity of our relationship, that we have got a strategic relationship that allows for engagement and for us to help deal with a major trade deficit, for example, and/or product safety or a SARS outbreak. Secretary PERSON-I empowered Secretary PERSON to develop this special working relationship with GPE. And it requires a lot of engagement. It requires engagement at the top, with President PERSON, who I respect, as well as people in my ORG. For those who argue that, they really have not -frankly have not followed how engaged we have been. Is GPE an issue for the world? But I do not view it as a negative issue; I view it as an opportunity to work with a-one of the really significantly growing economies in the world. First, I view that a growing middle class in GPE is good for GPE exporters. It provides opportunity. And it is -by the way, it is not only good for GPE exports; it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP, NORP. Anybody who is making a product somebody wants, it is just a good opportunity. And so as a part of our engagement with GPE, we have worked with PERSON to convince him to help convert his economy from one of savers to one of consumers, which means-and by the way, that takes a lot of effort and work to get in a position where you can even make those kind of constructive suggestions-which means the development of a pension system or health care, so that people do not feel like they have to hoard their money to save for a rainy day, but in fact, there is some kind of safety net that is predictable, which then would convert a NORP person who is beginning to realize better income into a consumer. And then all of a sudden, you have got consumers, which provide opportunity. Huge economic opportunity-you see GPE as the big grower of the economy in the Asia Pacific? No, I see GPE as the big driver for trade. At ORG, people ought to be wondering whether or not PERSON is going to keep taxes low to make sure our economy continues to grow, because we are a significant trading partner. I view GPE as an opportunity. I think GPE is going to drive a lot of the trade. That is why we conducted-now, having said that, I think GPE will provide opportunity for NORP producers, but we also provide the same opportunity. I do not view it as a CARDINAL-sum game, let me put it to you that way. I view it as an-I view-all of us contribute, so long as the world does not slip into protectionism. And part of the reason one goes to ORG is to promote trade and opportunity. And how do you plan to win the hearts and win the markets in the world, including in NORP countries like GPE? Well, I think, first of all, we have a complex relationship with GPE. GPE strongly supports markets. On the other hand, we also support open societies, transparency, where people are allowed to express themselves in a free society. I believe in freedom of religion. I believe in basic freedoms. So our relationship with GPE is, on the CARDINAL hand, we welcome trading opportunities. And what makes the relationship even more complex is, at the same time, we believe in human rights and human dignity. And we worked with the NORP leadership to promote human rights and human dignity. So it is not-it is hard to define the relationship in kind of a simple, CARDINAL-sentence structure. As I told you, I view GPE as a positive opportunity. I like him; I like to talk to him. We can share issues together. And he can say to me, What are your problems? In other words, we have got a personal relationship. And that is the way I try to do with all leaders because the best diplomacy is when you can sit down with somebody one on CARDINAL and speak candidly about issues and problems. See, that is what leaders do. You see problems and you anticipate problems and work together to accomplish something. I have also got a very good relationship with your leader. And so bilateral relations-first of all, in the NORP world, it is very important for people to understand that the war on terror is not a war against NORP; it is a war against murderers. I do not believe religious people, truly religious people kill the innocent. And therefore, it is important for leaders and countries to work together to prevent the murder of the innocent and, at the same time, make sure that we respect-GPE, in my case, respects religion, values the right for people to worship, and, in the case of ORG, values ORG as an important part of the international scene in the world we live in. Yes, well, I am better for it. I have a question on GPE. Is it possible that GPE will give up nuclear weapons program by the end of your term? And to help achieve it, are you ready to remove GPE from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, even without the resolution of NORP abductee issue? As to the first part of your question, I certainly hope that GPE honors its agreements. They-in DATE, they made a substantial agreement to disclose and dismantle all aspects of a nuclear weapons program. And here we are in DATE, DATE, where we are still reminding them of that agreement. On the other hand, a lot has happened in DATE that would lead me to believe that we are on- we are making progress. And we will continue to push toward the full disclosure and dismantlement. Secondly, we have-different aspects of our relationship are on the table, but it is performance based. In other words, we expect people to honor their agreements. Finally, as I assured Prime Minister PERSON, that we are not going to forget the abductee issue. He and the NORP people are very concerned that once certain aspects of the agreement are achieved, that we will forget the fact that NORP citizens have been abducted. ENTITY. I will never forget the meeting I had with the mother-it is very important for your readers to know that that had a deep impression on me- the mother whose daughter was abducted by NORP. I cannot imagine what that would mean. I guess I can imagine what it would mean; I just cannot understand, fully understand the pain that she felt-still feels. And I will never forget her coming to FAC with the picture of that little girl, picture of her daughter who got abducted. She sat right there in FAC. And my point to you is, is that I am not going to forget the mother or forget the fact. And so we will work with the-continue to work with the NORP to make it clear to NORP that we also expect there to be resolution to this issue. In other words, I understand, as well as I possibly can, the emotion that people attach to this issue. But now that I am DATE, it is not that old. It is all in your mind. Sir, your administration has indicated interest to appoint a special envoy to the ORG of Islamic Conference, or the ORG. Have you identified the person? And what will he or she do to bridge relations with the NORP countries in the NORP world, in light of the war in GPE and in light of the detention of extremists from NORP countries? First of all, we have not identified the person yet. We are working toward that end. As a matter of fact, I spoke to the Secretary of ORG about this TIME, coincidentally enough. Anyway, we are working the issue. Secondly, the reason why I suggested- or announced that we are going to do this is because I am concerned about the perceptions in the NORP world that GPE views the war on terror as a war against a particular religion. And I just explained to you that this is a war of extremists and radicals, ideologues driven by a vision that is not-that hijacks religion in order to justify their position. And any chance we have to dispel false notion and to reinforce the realities is helpful to GPE and frankly others as well. And so that is the reason to name the envoy. It also is a clear signal that we respect nations and that we treat the NORP world seriously. And you can do that all different kinds of ways. It is another moment for people to see the seriousness of intent. In terms of-murder is murder, and murder to achieve political objectives is-needs to be stopped. People murdered NORP to achieve a political objective. There is a debate in our country whether that is true or not. I have made up my mind. I believe it is absolutely fundamentally true because I am listening to what the enemy says, the enemy of freedom, what they are saying. They say, We want a caliphate, we want to spread our vision. It took a military action, by the way, to liberate people from that vision in GPE. This was not an attack on ORG; this was an attack for liberty. Think about a society in which you CARDINAL could not function in what you are doing because of your gender. Because the vision of these people-who murder the innocent, by the way, to achieve their vision-is that women are not equal. And it just so happened that, given the way the world is DATE, that that kind of ideologue provided safe haven for people who plotted and killed people in our country. CARDINAL, I am not going to stand for it; I am going to protect GPE, just like any other leader would protect their own country. And CARDINAL, CARDINAL way to achieve long-term peace is to help people realize forms of government that give hope. And so whether it be in GPE and GPE, we are helping people realize the blessings of freedom. Freedom yields peace. Forms of government matter. And so the ambassador to the ORG or the President or any other representative of GPE will be expressing this deep desire to work together to achieve peace. ENTITY, what do you think you have achieved with regards to GPE ties with Asia during your time in office? In other words, we are making progress. The first step was to get people to the table, to remind people that it is just not GPE with responsibility. The purpose of the-getting all QUANTITY of us to the table is so that if GPE tried to say, Well, I am really-I said I was going to do it, but I am not going to do it, then there is somebody else also saying, And here are the consequences. And now it is beginning to work because they are verifiably beginning to shut down the reactor. And so we have got more to do. Unfinished is kind of a loaded word, in a way. But I am not-we are not in control of- we are in control of putting the process in place and making sure it is consequential if somebody does not go forward. But it is the leader of GPE who gets to the make the decision. I have made my choice. Let me reiterate a little bit of what I said earlier. The definition of successful foreign policy is to be in a position to work with others to solve problems. And this administration has worked hard to be in a position to convince others to work together to solve problems. I have just outlined some of the problems, some of the problems-whether or not trade is open and people are treated fairly. CARDINAL classic example of this is intellectual property rights. I know that is a deep concern to your Government, just like it is to all our governments, that if you are trading with a country, you want to make sure that those intellectual property rights are treated respectfully. And in some societies, it is difficult. And therefore, we have to be in a position to work collaboratively and bilaterally to convince countries that in order to be a part of the international world, you have to honor contract. And CARDINAL contract is, you do not steal somebody else's intellectual property. But nevertheless, those kind of relationships exist now; we are able to have those kind of dialogs. There is been a lot of cooperation on the security front in remarkable ways since I have been President. The leadership of your country knows full well the dangers of extremism prevailing and have been very strong in working, for example, on the Proliferation Security Initiative. This is an initiative where many ORG nations have agreed to help find and stop the shipment of materiels which could end up in the hands of extremists and radicals that could harm us. And it took a while to get this relationship in place. But it is a relationship that is necessary to help prevent weapons of mass destruction from being moved. And here is a classic case of a successful collaborative effort. The biggest danger we have, it seems like to me, is isolationism and protectionism becoming prevalent philosophies. CARDINAL of the things that this administration has done in working with our friends is to work hard to explain to people the beneficial nature of trading together. And therefore-and that is manifested, by the way, in, for example, the free trade agreement with GPE, which was not a given. And there were some difficulties to overcome in GPE and in GPE, but nevertheless, we got it done. And entering into free trade agreements with other nations, such as GPE, has been good ways of making sure that we codify the benefits of open trading relationships. And so there is been a lot of progress made, and the NORP issue is the issue that we are spending a lot of time on and, hopefully, we can get completed. Just to the domestic scene, we have got Federal elections, as you know, coming up in GPE. Last time around, you had some comments with regards to the then opposition leader's policies on GPE. You described his policy of withdrawal from GPE as disastrous. You have a one-on-CARDINAL meeting with the opposition leader, PERSON; he is ahead in the polls. He is also got a policy in GPE which talks about withdrawal, albeit with caveats. I am just wondering, what is your view of the opposition leader, PERSON? What will you discuss in the meeting? And what do you make of his GPE policy? Yes, first of all, I think it makes sense for me to reach out to leading political figures when I go to other countries. And so I am looking forward to this meeting. I do not know much about him, frankly. Obviously, I have not -maybe I met him; I do not remember meeting him. When I spoke to the Parliament-- I am going to remind him that, CARDINAL, the stakes in GPE are very high for peace; that the liberation of a country-that country was important for peace; and that a democracy-NORP-style democracy in the heart of the Middle East is part of winning this ideological struggle. So the first thing I am going to do is explain to him my views about this-the world in which we live. And I will remind him that, as far as I am concerned, that leaving GPE before the job is done will cause an enemy that attacked us before to become emboldened. And as PERSON put it, to think the enemy will stay there and not follow us here is- in other words, we leave before the job is done, they will follow us home. That-I will remind him that the best way to conduct policy is based upon conditions on the ground; that success is important; that conditions ought to be driving troop deployments. And that is how-I will tell him how-what I would hope all our coalition partners would view the situation in GPE and GPE. Having said that, I do appreciate very much the fact that the NORP have sacrificed and have served. And I am looking forward to seeing some NORP troops with Prime Minister PERSON to thank them and, as importantly, thank their families for joining GPE and a lot of other countries in the great cause of liberation and peace. It is going to be an interesting trip, and what is interesting about these trips is that the time around the table with leaders is important, but also the time sitting down with individuals is important as well. It is a good opportunity to conduct foreign policy. And as I told you, a lot of foreign policy, for me, is the capacity to just look at somebody in the eye and tell them what I think and listen to what they think. It is finding that common ground, if possible, to solve problems. And sometimes you can solve problems by anticipating them and putting the conditions in place so that they will not arise in the first place. And sometimes they just show up, and you better be in a position to deal with them. Can I just clarify something? PERSON is-his theater-he is talked about the importance of GPE, talking about withdrawing our troops from GPE. That he is determined to-he has determined that the issue on Afghanistan- to keep troops in GPE. I view both GPE and GPE as theaters of the same war against radicals and extremists and look forward to sharing my views with Mr. PERSON, of course, and continue our discussions, strategic discussions with PERSON. My next question would touch on NORP cleric PERSON. As you might know, since he was released from jail, has been exercising activities like any other citizens, including recently-DATE he inaugurated a long march participated by CARDINAL of his followers, in connection with that commemoration, or welcoming DATE NORP fasting DATE. Actually, how close has your Government monitored the activities of PERSON? First of all, I did not know he led a parade of CARDINAL people. So that may answer your first question. I am sure our Embassy is aware of the activities that take place in your country. I mean, you are a free country where people are allowed to express themselves in the public square, which is a sign of a healthy society. I am concerned, however, about anybody who preaches violence and extremism and radicalism in a world in which innocent people just get simply murdered for ideological purposes. There were some terrible murders in your country, as you know, just like in mine, and I am confident that by far the vast majority-all of GPE rejects that kind of behavior. Innocent people were killed in GPE for no other reason than they just happened to be vacationing and because somebody wanted to send a political message because they are involved with this ideological struggle. And those of us who want there to be peace have got to reject this kind of behavior. And so your Government is a government of law; your Government will conduct itself according to your laws. But anybody who preaches that kind of violence in the name of what I would call a dark political vision needs to be taken seriously. My next question is about the GPE relationship and the war on terror. The opposition party in GPE is threatening to cut the extension of NORP participation in the antiterrorism operations in the Indian Ocean. Are you concerned about that? And will you be-will you raise this issue when you will meet Prime Minister PERSON in GPE? First of all, GPE has been a positive contributor to dealing with the extremists in this ideological war. And I thank ORG and the people of GPE for their contributions. And I would hope that they would continue to maintain this-their positive influence. And of course, my conversations with Prime Minister PERSON, whom I respect a great deal, will center on the war on terror, as well as a lot of other key issues. GPE has played a significant role in many of the things we have discussed here, like Proliferation Security Initiative, CARDINAL-party talks. They have been a constructive partner in peace, and I will-we will talk about all aspects of our relationship. ENTITY, DATE,GPE celebrates its 50th-- Fiftieth-make sure my congratulatory remarks get in your article. PERSON Congratulates GPE. Do you think that is what it will say? It also marks the 50th relations between the GPE and GPE So what are your outlook and hopes for GPE relations, and especially with GPE being the 10th largest trading partner? First of all, I do believe we ought to have-take this notion of trade and have meaningful discussions with a potential free trade agreement with GPE. Secondly, I respect Prime Minister PERSON, admire his leadership. When his wife died, I tried to call him early just to let him know I cared about him. I will congratulate him. Do not put that in the article, that you had to tell me that. You can put it in there if you want. I will be glad to-I am going to congratulate him. You did congratulate him. I am going to congratulate him again. I will double the congratulations. That is right; I did write him a note. Did I call him or write him a note? You wrote him a note. Anyway, GPE is an interesting example of how a free society can deal with movements that could conceivably change and alter the nature of the free society. And I respect the way the Prime Minister has used freedom and used the openness of society to kind of deal with frustration. I mean, all societies have frustrated people. And the question is, will the outlet of that frustration lead to violence or lead to peace? And GPE is an example of a country where frustrations have been channeled in a constructive way. And therefore, he is a leader, as far as I am concerned, and a very constructive force for Southeast Asia. By the way, I am going to meet with the ORG leaders, which is an important meeting as well. It is an opportunity for GPE to stay very much engaged with ORG. I unfortunately will not be there for the 60th, but look forward to having an event that would kind of recognize the importance of ORG as far as GPE is concerned. So this is a side meeting with the ORG leaders after ORG meeting, sir? I try to do that every time. So they will have somebody like-I will sit down and meet with the ORG nations as well. The other thing that is interesting about GPE is, they are going to be one of the leaders on alternative fuels. I believe that it is in our interests that we develop the technologies necessary to deal with energy dependence as well as greenhouse gases. Back to the climate changes-the way-if you are truly interested in dealing with greenhouse gases, people need to focus on the development of technologies that will enable us to, on the CARDINAL hand, grow our economies, on the other hand, be good stewards of the environment. Just for the record-and this probably will not be a headline, although I have tried to make it one a lot-when it comes time to climate change, there is CARDINAL major industrialized nation that actually grew its economy and reduced greenhouse gases; that would be GPE that actually had greenhouse gases go down and the economy go up. So something is working here, and it is technologies, use of technologies. And so I am going to be reminding people about-that we can come up with a strategy that does not impoverish our people and, at the same time, takes advantage of technologies. And we are going to need to share some technologies with newly emerging economies in order to achieve this objective. Anyway, I forgot to make that point. I am not making the point to you, as you can tell. That is why I am kind of looking over your shoulder. There appears to be a perception in Southeast Asia that this administration has neglected the region. How do you plan to convince them otherwise when you meet in ORG? Well, I-do you want to ask another question, because I already answered it. I will be glad to answer it again- which is, we have got strong bilateral-first of all, the number of trips I have taken- I have gone to every ORG meeting. I have spent a lot of time with leaders both here and in your respective countries-that we have got relations to a point where we can work together to solve common problems. PSI is CARDINAL such example of a strategy we have implemented to deal with the realities of the world. And so it is -the truth of the matter is, I spend a lot of time working on NORP matters. And all I will ask you to do is look at the results of the individual relationships and the ability to put processes in place to deal with the threats we live in and the capacity to work together to solve problems and to create opportunities. And to me, that is a sign of a healthy, robust relationship with an important part of the world.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintmedia0", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Media", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-media-0", "publication_date": "30-08-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 12, "text": "I am looking forward to my trip. This is the seventh ORG summit that I have been to. I find them to be important for GPE in the following ways. CARDINAL, it is an opportunity to stress the importance that we place upon basic values, basic value of liberty, basic value of open markets in order to enhance prosperity. It is a chance to remind people that we are linked together. It is an interesting setting, when you have people from different cultures, different languages come together for a common purpose. It is also a chance for me to remind our country how important it is to have constructive ties in Asia. Asia is a place where we have spilt a lot of blood in the past, and now it is a place of peace. Asia is a place where GPE was engaged militarily, and now we are engaged culturally and socially and economically in a way that is constructive for our peoples. It will be an opportunity for-remind me that it is possible for enemies to be allies and for enemies to be friends. It is a lesson for a lot of us to think about when we think about the Middle East, that forms of government matter and hopeful societies yield peace. I am looking forward to the discussions about trade. The first priority for trade for me at the meeting will be on GPE. I am a firm believer in free trade. I believe the GPE round is the best opportunity for us to accomplish a couple of objectives. CARDINAL is to fight off protectionism and trade freely, and secondly is to help eliminate poverty. This will be an opportunity for the leaders of the ORG summit to express their desire to see the GPE round succeed. We will take the lead in that, along with other nations. There is also an opportunity for us to start talking about a free trade agreement of the Pacific region. And I am looking forward to having that dialog, begin the dialog. It would just be kind of an interesting opportunity to have the dialog on this aspect of our strategic partnership there and to move forward. We have got a lot of-we have got some free trade agreements with people, and that will be at the table. Opportunity for me to continue to talk about the struggle between radicalism and reasonableness, between extremism and people that want to live in peace. I happen to believe-I am sure you have heard me say this-that we are in a major ideological struggle-a struggle we will win, by the way. But it is going to require resolve and dedication. And this will be an opportunity for me to remind our friends at the table that this is the call of our time and that we have an opportunity to write a hopeful chapter here in DATE and to thank people around the table for understanding this is the call of the time, because there is been a lot of constructive engagement and good work, all aimed at protecting ourselves from short-term attack-in the short term from attack and recognizing that changing conditions of life in the long term will enable us to live in peace. And finally, I am looking forward to reminding people that I take the climate change issue seriously; that we recognize that there needs to be international-an international accord to get people at the table who are the major emitters to set a goal. Step CARDINAL to solving a problem is to set the goal on what we ought to achieve. If you want somebody to be a part of the problem-a part of the solution, you need to let them be a part of defining what the goal ought to be. So many of the people at the ORG table are going to come to the major economy conference that-those of us who are emitters will be there, including GPE, which will be at the table. I do not want to single GPE out, but GPE has got a major role to play. Any agreement without GPE is not going to be an effective agreement. So my strategy has been to get GPE at the table. We will further the dialog. PERSON has got some very interesting ways to further the dialog in a constructive way, particularly talking about energy usage. So we will be looking forward to his leadership on the issue. When I told him I was looking forward to coming, we discussed this issue. He is concerned about greenhouse gases. And so he will take the lead here at the conference, and GPE will play a constructive role. We have got a big agenda. It is my second trip to GPE. I remind people that GPE-parts of GPE reminds me of GPE--and there is no higher compliment. I think on behalf of all of us, I can say thank you very much for this opportunity DATE. As you have just analyzed, ENTITY, obviously GPE and the Middle East, the war on terror is an overarching policy issue for the PERSON administration. Nonetheless, there has been a perception in the region that this has distracted GPE from engagement in Asia. Some people are calling this the Pacific DATE. You are cutting short your trip to GPE because of the GPE issue. I am just wondering, do you think that is warranted, that criticism, and do you see GPE, for instance, playing the role-the driver in DATE, not the GPE? No, it is interesting, first of all, this administration has got good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE. Our relationship with the ORG countries are as strong as GPE has ever been, and of course our ties with GPE are tight, really tight. And the reason I say that is, is that this just does not happen without work. And I have worked hard to develop bilateral relations in such a way that we can achieve strategic objectives. I believe the relations with GPE and the Asian-Pacific region have never been better, and as a result, we are addressing problems and creating opportunities. CARDINAL problem, of course, is GPE. When I came into office, the world was expecting GPE to solve the GPE issue alone. To me-and the NORP leader had basically not honored the bilateral agreement that had been struck, and therefore, felt like we needed to put this issue in a position in which others were speaking besides GPE-and have started the CARDINAL-party talks. CARDINAL countries were convinced to come to the table on CARDINAL side to convince the NORP leader to give up his nuclear weapons ambitions. That would not have happened without engagement and good, solid relations. Another issue obviously is our bilateral relations with GPE. It is the same-you are in a little different position in that you have got a nice trade surplus with GPE. We have got a trade deficit with GPE. And it is important for us to have a-given the complexity of our relationship, that we have got a strategic relationship that allows for engagement and for us to help deal with a major trade deficit, for example, and/or product safety or a SARS outbreak. Secretary PERSON-I empowered Secretary PERSON to develop this special working relationship with GPE. And it requires a lot of engagement. It requires engagement at the top, with President PERSON, who I respect, as well as people in my ORG. For those who argue that, they really have not -frankly have not followed how engaged we have been. Is GPE an issue for the world? But I do not view it as a negative issue; I view it as an opportunity to work with a-one of the really significantly growing economies in the world. First, I view that a growing middle class in GPE is good for GPE exporters. It provides opportunity. And it is -by the way, it is not only good for GPE exports; it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP, NORP. Anybody who is making a product somebody wants, it is just a good opportunity. And so as a part of our engagement with GPE, we have worked with PERSON to convince him to help convert his economy from one of savers to one of consumers, which means-and by the way, that takes a lot of effort and work to get in a position where you can even make those kind of constructive suggestions-which means the development of a pension system or health care, so that people do not feel like they have to hoard their money to save for a rainy day, but in fact, there is some kind of safety net that is predictable, which then would convert a NORP person who is beginning to realize better income into a consumer. And then all of a sudden, you have got consumers, which provide opportunity. Huge economic opportunity-you see GPE as the big grower of the economy in the Asia Pacific? No, I see GPE as the big driver for trade. At ORG, people ought to be wondering whether or not PERSON is going to keep taxes low to make sure our economy continues to grow, because we are a significant trading partner. I view GPE as an opportunity. I think GPE is going to drive a lot of the trade. That is why we conducted-now, having said that, I think GPE will provide opportunity for NORP producers, but we also provide the same opportunity. I do not view it as a CARDINAL-sum game, let me put it to you that way. I view it as an-I view-all of us contribute, so long as the world does not slip into protectionism. And part of the reason one goes to ORG is to promote trade and opportunity. And how do you plan to win the hearts and win the markets in the world, including in NORP countries like GPE? Well, I think, first of all, we have a complex relationship with GPE. GPE strongly supports markets. On the other hand, we also support open societies, transparency, where people are allowed to express themselves in a free society. I believe in freedom of religion. I believe in basic freedoms. So our relationship with GPE is, on the CARDINAL hand, we welcome trading opportunities. And what makes the relationship even more complex is, at the same time, we believe in human rights and human dignity. And we worked with the NORP leadership to promote human rights and human dignity. So it is not-it is hard to define the relationship in kind of a simple, CARDINAL-sentence structure. As I told you, I view GPE as a positive opportunity. I like him; I like to talk to him. We can share issues together. And he can say to me, What are your problems? In other words, we have got a personal relationship. And that is the way I try to do with all leaders because the best diplomacy is when you can sit down with somebody one on CARDINAL and speak candidly about issues and problems. See, that is what leaders do. You see problems and you anticipate problems and work together to accomplish something. I have also got a very good relationship with your leader. And so bilateral relations-first of all, in the NORP world, it is very important for people to understand that the war on terror is not a war against NORP; it is a war against murderers. I do not believe religious people, truly religious people kill the innocent. And therefore, it is important for leaders and countries to work together to prevent the murder of the innocent and, at the same time, make sure that we respect-GPE, in my case, respects religion, values the right for people to worship, and, in the case of ORG, values ORG as an important part of the international scene in the world we live in. Yes, well, I am better for it. I have a question on GPE. Is it possible that GPE will give up nuclear weapons program by the end of your term? And to help achieve it, are you ready to remove GPE from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, even without the resolution of NORP abductee issue? As to the first part of your question, I certainly hope that GPE honors its agreements. They-in DATE, they made a substantial agreement to disclose and dismantle all aspects of a nuclear weapons program. And here we are in DATE, DATE, where we are still reminding them of that agreement. On the other hand, a lot has happened in DATE that would lead me to believe that we are on- we are making progress. And we will continue to push toward the full disclosure and dismantlement. Secondly, we have-different aspects of our relationship are on the table, but it is performance based. In other words, we expect people to honor their agreements. Finally, as I assured Prime Minister PERSON, that we are not going to forget the abductee issue. He and the NORP people are very concerned that once certain aspects of the agreement are achieved, that we will forget the fact that NORP citizens have been abducted. ENTITY. I will never forget the meeting I had with the mother-it is very important for your readers to know that that had a deep impression on me- the mother whose daughter was abducted by NORP. I cannot imagine what that would mean. I guess I can imagine what it would mean; I just cannot understand, fully understand the pain that she felt-still feels. And I will never forget her coming to FAC with the picture of that little girl, picture of her daughter who got abducted. She sat right there in FAC. And my point to you is, is that I am not going to forget the mother or forget the fact. And so we will work with the-continue to work with the NORP to make it clear to NORP that we also expect there to be resolution to this issue. In other words, I understand, as well as I possibly can, the emotion that people attach to this issue. But now that I am DATE, it is not that old. It is all in your mind. Sir, your administration has indicated interest to appoint a special envoy to the ORG of Islamic Conference, or the ORG. Have you identified the person? And what will he or she do to bridge relations with the NORP countries in the NORP world, in light of the war in GPE and in light of the detention of extremists from NORP countries? First of all, we have not identified the person yet. We are working toward that end. As a matter of fact, I spoke to the Secretary of ORG about this TIME, coincidentally enough. Anyway, we are working the issue. Secondly, the reason why I suggested- or announced that we are going to do this is because I am concerned about the perceptions in the NORP world that GPE views the war on terror as a war against a particular religion. And I just explained to you that this is a war of extremists and radicals, ideologues driven by a vision that is not-that hijacks religion in order to justify their position. And any chance we have to dispel false notion and to reinforce the realities is helpful to GPE and frankly others as well. And so that is the reason to name the envoy. It also is a clear signal that we respect nations and that we treat the NORP world seriously. And you can do that all different kinds of ways. It is another moment for people to see the seriousness of intent. In terms of-murder is murder, and murder to achieve political objectives is-needs to be stopped. People murdered NORP to achieve a political objective. There is a debate in our country whether that is true or not. I have made up my mind. I believe it is absolutely fundamentally true because I am listening to what the enemy says, the enemy of freedom, what they are saying. They say, We want a caliphate, we want to spread our vision. It took a military action, by the way, to liberate people from that vision in GPE. This was not an attack on ORG; this was an attack for liberty. Think about a society in which you CARDINAL could not function in what you are doing because of your gender. Because the vision of these people-who murder the innocent, by the way, to achieve their vision-is that women are not equal. And it just so happened that, given the way the world is DATE, that that kind of ideologue provided safe haven for people who plotted and killed people in our country. CARDINAL, I am not going to stand for it; I am going to protect GPE, just like any other leader would protect their own country. And CARDINAL, CARDINAL way to achieve long-term peace is to help people realize forms of government that give hope. And so whether it be in GPE and GPE, we are helping people realize the blessings of freedom. Freedom yields peace. Forms of government matter. And so the ambassador to the ORG or the President or any other representative of GPE will be expressing this deep desire to work together to achieve peace. ENTITY, what do you think you have achieved with regards to GPE ties with Asia during your time in office? In other words, we are making progress. The first step was to get people to the table, to remind people that it is just not GPE with responsibility. The purpose of the-getting all QUANTITY of us to the table is so that if GPE tried to say, Well, I am really-I said I was going to do it, but I am not going to do it, then there is somebody else also saying, And here are the consequences. And now it is beginning to work because they are verifiably beginning to shut down the reactor. And so we have got more to do. Unfinished is kind of a loaded word, in a way. But I am not-we are not in control of- we are in control of putting the process in place and making sure it is consequential if somebody does not go forward. But it is the leader of GPE who gets to the make the decision. I have made my choice. Let me reiterate a little bit of what I said earlier. The definition of successful foreign policy is to be in a position to work with others to solve problems. And this administration has worked hard to be in a position to convince others to work together to solve problems. I have just outlined some of the problems, some of the problems-whether or not trade is open and people are treated fairly. CARDINAL classic example of this is intellectual property rights. I know that is a deep concern to your Government, just like it is to all our governments, that if you are trading with a country, you want to make sure that those intellectual property rights are treated respectfully. And in some societies, it is difficult. And therefore, we have to be in a position to work collaboratively and bilaterally to convince countries that in order to be a part of the international world, you have to honor contract. And CARDINAL contract is, you do not steal somebody else's intellectual property. But nevertheless, those kind of relationships exist now; we are able to have those kind of dialogs. There is been a lot of cooperation on the security front in remarkable ways since I have been President. The leadership of your country knows full well the dangers of extremism prevailing and have been very strong in working, for example, on the Proliferation Security Initiative. This is an initiative where many ORG nations have agreed to help find and stop the shipment of materiels which could end up in the hands of extremists and radicals that could harm us. And it took a while to get this relationship in place. But it is a relationship that is necessary to help prevent weapons of mass destruction from being moved. And here is a classic case of a successful collaborative effort. The biggest danger we have, it seems like to me, is isolationism and protectionism becoming prevalent philosophies. CARDINAL of the things that this administration has done in working with our friends is to work hard to explain to people the beneficial nature of trading together. And therefore-and that is manifested, by the way, in, for example, the free trade agreement with GPE, which was not a given. And there were some difficulties to overcome in GPE and in GPE, but nevertheless, we got it done. And entering into free trade agreements with other nations, such as GPE, has been good ways of making sure that we codify the benefits of open trading relationships. And so there is been a lot of progress made, and the NORP issue is the issue that we are spending a lot of time on and, hopefully, we can get completed. Just to the domestic scene, we have got Federal elections, as you know, coming up in GPE. Last time around, you had some comments with regards to the then opposition leader's policies on GPE. You described his policy of withdrawal from GPE as disastrous. You have a one-on-CARDINAL meeting with the opposition leader, PERSON; he is ahead in the polls. He is also got a policy in GPE which talks about withdrawal, albeit with caveats. I am just wondering, what is your view of the opposition leader, PERSON? What will you discuss in the meeting? And what do you make of his GPE policy? Yes, first of all, I think it makes sense for me to reach out to leading political figures when I go to other countries. And so I am looking forward to this meeting. I do not know much about him, frankly. Obviously, I have not -maybe I met him; I do not remember meeting him. When I spoke to the Parliament-- I am going to remind him that, CARDINAL, the stakes in GPE are very high for peace; that the liberation of a country-that country was important for peace; and that a democracy-NORP-style democracy in the heart of the Middle East is part of winning this ideological struggle. So the first thing I am going to do is explain to him my views about this-the world in which we live. And I will remind him that, as far as I am concerned, that leaving GPE before the job is done will cause an enemy that attacked us before to become emboldened. And as PERSON put it, to think the enemy will stay there and not follow us here is- in other words, we leave before the job is done, they will follow us home. That-I will remind him that the best way to conduct policy is based upon conditions on the ground; that success is important; that conditions ought to be driving troop deployments. And that is how-I will tell him how-what I would hope all our coalition partners would view the situation in GPE and GPE. Having said that, I do appreciate very much the fact that the NORP have sacrificed and have served. And I am looking forward to seeing some NORP troops with Prime Minister PERSON to thank them and, as importantly, thank their families for joining GPE and a lot of other countries in the great cause of liberation and peace. It is going to be an interesting trip, and what is interesting about these trips is that the time around the table with leaders is important, but also the time sitting down with individuals is important as well. It is a good opportunity to conduct foreign policy. And as I told you, a lot of foreign policy, for me, is the capacity to just look at somebody in the eye and tell them what I think and listen to what they think. It is finding that common ground, if possible, to solve problems. And sometimes you can solve problems by anticipating them and putting the conditions in place so that they will not arise in the first place. And sometimes they just show up, and you better be in a position to deal with them. Can I just clarify something? PERSON is-his theater-he is talked about the importance of GPE, talking about withdrawing our troops from GPE. That he is determined to-he has determined that the issue on Afghanistan- to keep troops in GPE. I view both GPE and GPE as theaters of the same war against radicals and extremists and look forward to sharing my views with Mr. PERSON, of course, and continue our discussions, strategic discussions with PERSON. My next question would touch on NORP cleric PERSON. As you might know, since he was released from jail, has been exercising activities like any other citizens, including recently-DATE he inaugurated a long march participated by CARDINAL of his followers, in connection with that commemoration, or welcoming DATE NORP fasting DATE. Actually, how close has your Government monitored the activities of PERSON? First of all, I did not know he led a parade of CARDINAL people. So that may answer your first question. I am sure our Embassy is aware of the activities that take place in your country. I mean, you are a free country where people are allowed to express themselves in the public square, which is a sign of a healthy society. I am concerned, however, about anybody who preaches violence and extremism and radicalism in a world in which innocent people just get simply murdered for ideological purposes. There were some terrible murders in your country, as you know, just like in mine, and I am confident that by far the vast majority-all of GPE rejects that kind of behavior. Innocent people were killed in GPE for no other reason than they just happened to be vacationing and because somebody wanted to send a political message because they are involved with this ideological struggle. And those of us who want there to be peace have got to reject this kind of behavior. And so your Government is a government of law; your Government will conduct itself according to your laws. But anybody who preaches that kind of violence in the name of what I would call a dark political vision needs to be taken seriously. My next question is about the GPE relationship and the war on terror. The opposition party in GPE is threatening to cut the extension of NORP participation in the antiterrorism operations in the Indian Ocean. Are you concerned about that? And will you be-will you raise this issue when you will meet Prime Minister PERSON in GPE? First of all, GPE has been a positive contributor to dealing with the extremists in this ideological war. And I thank ORG and the people of GPE for their contributions. And I would hope that they would continue to maintain this-their positive influence. And of course, my conversations with Prime Minister PERSON, whom I respect a great deal, will center on the war on terror, as well as a lot of other key issues. GPE has played a significant role in many of the things we have discussed here, like Proliferation Security Initiative, CARDINAL-party talks. They have been a constructive partner in peace, and I will-we will talk about all aspects of our relationship. ENTITY, DATE,GPE celebrates its 50th-- Fiftieth-make sure my congratulatory remarks get in your article. PERSON Congratulates GPE. Do you think that is what it will say? It also marks the 50th relations between the GPE and GPE So what are your outlook and hopes for GPE relations, and especially with GPE being the 10th largest trading partner? First of all, I do believe we ought to have-take this notion of trade and have meaningful discussions with a potential free trade agreement with GPE. Secondly, I respect Prime Minister PERSON, admire his leadership. When his wife died, I tried to call him early just to let him know I cared about him. I will congratulate him. Do not put that in the article, that you had to tell me that. You can put it in there if you want. I will be glad to-I am going to congratulate him. You did congratulate him. I am going to congratulate him again. I will double the congratulations. That is right; I did write him a note. Did I call him or write him a note? You wrote him a note. Anyway, GPE is an interesting example of how a free society can deal with movements that could conceivably change and alter the nature of the free society. And I respect the way the Prime Minister has used freedom and used the openness of society to kind of deal with frustration. I mean, all societies have frustrated people. And the question is, will the outlet of that frustration lead to violence or lead to peace? And GPE is an example of a country where frustrations have been channeled in a constructive way. And therefore, he is a leader, as far as I am concerned, and a very constructive force for Southeast Asia. By the way, I am going to meet with the ORG leaders, which is an important meeting as well. It is an opportunity for GPE to stay very much engaged with ORG. I unfortunately will not be there for the 60th, but look forward to having an event that would kind of recognize the importance of ORG as far as GPE is concerned. So this is a side meeting with the ORG leaders after ORG meeting, sir? I try to do that every time. So they will have somebody like-I will sit down and meet with the ORG nations as well. The other thing that is interesting about GPE is, they are going to be one of the leaders on alternative fuels. I believe that it is in our interests that we develop the technologies necessary to deal with energy dependence as well as greenhouse gases. Back to the climate changes-the way-if you are truly interested in dealing with greenhouse gases, people need to focus on the development of technologies that will enable us to, on the CARDINAL hand, grow our economies, on the other hand, be good stewards of the environment. Just for the record-and this probably will not be a headline, although I have tried to make it one a lot-when it comes time to climate change, there is CARDINAL major industrialized nation that actually grew its economy and reduced greenhouse gases; that would be GPE that actually had greenhouse gases go down and the economy go up. So something is working here, and it is technologies, use of technologies. And so I am going to be reminding people about-that we can come up with a strategy that does not impoverish our people and, at the same time, takes advantage of technologies. And we are going to need to share some technologies with newly emerging economies in order to achieve this objective. Anyway, I forgot to make that point. I am not making the point to you, as you can tell. That is why I am kind of looking over your shoulder. There appears to be a perception in Southeast Asia that this administration has neglected the region. How do you plan to convince them otherwise when you meet in ORG? Well, I-do you want to ask another question, because I already answered it. I will be glad to answer it again- which is, we have got strong bilateral-first of all, the number of trips I have taken- I have gone to every ORG meeting. I have spent a lot of time with leaders both here and in your respective countries-that we have got relations to a point where we can work together to solve common problems. PSI is CARDINAL such example of a strategy we have implemented to deal with the realities of the world. And so it is -the truth of the matter is, I spend a lot of time working on NORP matters. And all I will ask you to do is look at the results of the individual relationships and the ability to put processes in place to deal with the threats we live in and the capacity to work together to solve problems and to create opportunities. And to me, that is a sign of a healthy, robust relationship with an important part of the world.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintmedia0", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Media", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-media-0", "publication_date": "30-08-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 12, "text": "I am looking forward to my trip. This is the seventh ORG summit that I have been to. I find them to be important for GPE in the following ways. CARDINAL, it is an opportunity to stress the importance that we place upon basic values, basic value of liberty, basic value of open markets in order to enhance prosperity. It is a chance to remind people that we are linked together. It is an interesting setting, when you have people from different cultures, different languages come together for a common purpose. It is also a chance for me to remind our country how important it is to have constructive ties in Asia. Asia is a place where we have spilt a lot of blood in the past, and now it is a place of peace. Asia is a place where GPE was engaged militarily, and now we are engaged culturally and socially and economically in a way that is constructive for our peoples. It will be an opportunity for-remind me that it is possible for enemies to be allies and for enemies to be friends. It is a lesson for a lot of us to think about when we think about the Middle East, that forms of government matter and hopeful societies yield peace. I am looking forward to the discussions about trade. The first priority for trade for me at the meeting will be on GPE. I am a firm believer in free trade. I believe the GPE round is the best opportunity for us to accomplish a couple of objectives. CARDINAL is to fight off protectionism and trade freely, and secondly is to help eliminate poverty. This will be an opportunity for the leaders of the ORG summit to express their desire to see the GPE round succeed. We will take the lead in that, along with other nations. There is also an opportunity for us to start talking about a free trade agreement of the Pacific region. And I am looking forward to having that dialog, begin the dialog. It would just be kind of an interesting opportunity to have the dialog on this aspect of our strategic partnership there and to move forward. We have got a lot of-we have got some free trade agreements with people, and that will be at the table. Opportunity for me to continue to talk about the struggle between radicalism and reasonableness, between extremism and people that want to live in peace. I happen to believe-I am sure you have heard me say this-that we are in a major ideological struggle-a struggle we will win, by the way. But it is going to require resolve and dedication. And this will be an opportunity for me to remind our friends at the table that this is the call of our time and that we have an opportunity to write a hopeful chapter here in DATE and to thank people around the table for understanding this is the call of the time, because there is been a lot of constructive engagement and good work, all aimed at protecting ourselves from short-term attack-in the short term from attack and recognizing that changing conditions of life in the long term will enable us to live in peace. And finally, I am looking forward to reminding people that I take the climate change issue seriously; that we recognize that there needs to be international-an international accord to get people at the table who are the major emitters to set a goal. Step CARDINAL to solving a problem is to set the goal on what we ought to achieve. If you want somebody to be a part of the problem-a part of the solution, you need to let them be a part of defining what the goal ought to be. So many of the people at the ORG table are going to come to the major economy conference that-those of us who are emitters will be there, including GPE, which will be at the table. I do not want to single GPE out, but GPE has got a major role to play. Any agreement without GPE is not going to be an effective agreement. So my strategy has been to get GPE at the table. We will further the dialog. PERSON has got some very interesting ways to further the dialog in a constructive way, particularly talking about energy usage. So we will be looking forward to his leadership on the issue. When I told him I was looking forward to coming, we discussed this issue. He is concerned about greenhouse gases. And so he will take the lead here at the conference, and GPE will play a constructive role. We have got a big agenda. It is my second trip to GPE. I remind people that GPE-parts of GPE reminds me of GPE--and there is no higher compliment. I think on behalf of all of us, I can say thank you very much for this opportunity DATE. As you have just analyzed, ENTITY, obviously GPE and the Middle East, the war on terror is an overarching policy issue for the PERSON administration. Nonetheless, there has been a perception in the region that this has distracted GPE from engagement in Asia. Some people are calling this the Pacific DATE. You are cutting short your trip to GPE because of the GPE issue. I am just wondering, do you think that is warranted, that criticism, and do you see GPE, for instance, playing the role-the driver in DATE, not the GPE? No, it is interesting, first of all, this administration has got good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE. Our relationship with the ORG countries are as strong as GPE has ever been, and of course our ties with GPE are tight, really tight. And the reason I say that is, is that this just does not happen without work. And I have worked hard to develop bilateral relations in such a way that we can achieve strategic objectives. I believe the relations with GPE and the Asian-Pacific region have never been better, and as a result, we are addressing problems and creating opportunities. CARDINAL problem, of course, is GPE. When I came into office, the world was expecting GPE to solve the GPE issue alone. To me-and the NORP leader had basically not honored the bilateral agreement that had been struck, and therefore, felt like we needed to put this issue in a position in which others were speaking besides GPE-and have started the CARDINAL-party talks. CARDINAL countries were convinced to come to the table on CARDINAL side to convince the NORP leader to give up his nuclear weapons ambitions. That would not have happened without engagement and good, solid relations. Another issue obviously is our bilateral relations with GPE. It is the same-you are in a little different position in that you have got a nice trade surplus with GPE. We have got a trade deficit with GPE. And it is important for us to have a-given the complexity of our relationship, that we have got a strategic relationship that allows for engagement and for us to help deal with a major trade deficit, for example, and/or product safety or a SARS outbreak. Secretary PERSON-I empowered Secretary PERSON to develop this special working relationship with GPE. And it requires a lot of engagement. It requires engagement at the top, with President PERSON, who I respect, as well as people in my ORG. For those who argue that, they really have not -frankly have not followed how engaged we have been. Is GPE an issue for the world? But I do not view it as a negative issue; I view it as an opportunity to work with a-one of the really significantly growing economies in the world. First, I view that a growing middle class in GPE is good for GPE exporters. It provides opportunity. And it is -by the way, it is not only good for GPE exports; it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP, NORP. Anybody who is making a product somebody wants, it is just a good opportunity. And so as a part of our engagement with GPE, we have worked with PERSON to convince him to help convert his economy from one of savers to one of consumers, which means-and by the way, that takes a lot of effort and work to get in a position where you can even make those kind of constructive suggestions-which means the development of a pension system or health care, so that people do not feel like they have to hoard their money to save for a rainy day, but in fact, there is some kind of safety net that is predictable, which then would convert a NORP person who is beginning to realize better income into a consumer. And then all of a sudden, you have got consumers, which provide opportunity. Huge economic opportunity-you see GPE as the big grower of the economy in the Asia Pacific? No, I see GPE as the big driver for trade. At ORG, people ought to be wondering whether or not PERSON is going to keep taxes low to make sure our economy continues to grow, because we are a significant trading partner. I view GPE as an opportunity. I think GPE is going to drive a lot of the trade. That is why we conducted-now, having said that, I think GPE will provide opportunity for NORP producers, but we also provide the same opportunity. I do not view it as a CARDINAL-sum game, let me put it to you that way. I view it as an-I view-all of us contribute, so long as the world does not slip into protectionism. And part of the reason one goes to ORG is to promote trade and opportunity. And how do you plan to win the hearts and win the markets in the world, including in NORP countries like GPE? Well, I think, first of all, we have a complex relationship with GPE. GPE strongly supports markets. On the other hand, we also support open societies, transparency, where people are allowed to express themselves in a free society. I believe in freedom of religion. I believe in basic freedoms. So our relationship with GPE is, on the CARDINAL hand, we welcome trading opportunities. And what makes the relationship even more complex is, at the same time, we believe in human rights and human dignity. And we worked with the NORP leadership to promote human rights and human dignity. So it is not-it is hard to define the relationship in kind of a simple, CARDINAL-sentence structure. As I told you, I view GPE as a positive opportunity. I like him; I like to talk to him. We can share issues together. And he can say to me, What are your problems? In other words, we have got a personal relationship. And that is the way I try to do with all leaders because the best diplomacy is when you can sit down with somebody one on CARDINAL and speak candidly about issues and problems. See, that is what leaders do. You see problems and you anticipate problems and work together to accomplish something. I have also got a very good relationship with your leader. And so bilateral relations-first of all, in the NORP world, it is very important for people to understand that the war on terror is not a war against NORP; it is a war against murderers. I do not believe religious people, truly religious people kill the innocent. And therefore, it is important for leaders and countries to work together to prevent the murder of the innocent and, at the same time, make sure that we respect-GPE, in my case, respects religion, values the right for people to worship, and, in the case of ORG, values ORG as an important part of the international scene in the world we live in. Yes, well, I am better for it. I have a question on GPE. Is it possible that GPE will give up nuclear weapons program by the end of your term? And to help achieve it, are you ready to remove GPE from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, even without the resolution of NORP abductee issue? As to the first part of your question, I certainly hope that GPE honors its agreements. They-in DATE, they made a substantial agreement to disclose and dismantle all aspects of a nuclear weapons program. And here we are in DATE, DATE, where we are still reminding them of that agreement. On the other hand, a lot has happened in DATE that would lead me to believe that we are on- we are making progress. And we will continue to push toward the full disclosure and dismantlement. Secondly, we have-different aspects of our relationship are on the table, but it is performance based. In other words, we expect people to honor their agreements. Finally, as I assured Prime Minister PERSON, that we are not going to forget the abductee issue. He and the NORP people are very concerned that once certain aspects of the agreement are achieved, that we will forget the fact that NORP citizens have been abducted. ENTITY. I will never forget the meeting I had with the mother-it is very important for your readers to know that that had a deep impression on me- the mother whose daughter was abducted by NORP. I cannot imagine what that would mean. I guess I can imagine what it would mean; I just cannot understand, fully understand the pain that she felt-still feels. And I will never forget her coming to FAC with the picture of that little girl, picture of her daughter who got abducted. She sat right there in FAC. And my point to you is, is that I am not going to forget the mother or forget the fact. And so we will work with the-continue to work with the NORP to make it clear to NORP that we also expect there to be resolution to this issue. In other words, I understand, as well as I possibly can, the emotion that people attach to this issue. But now that I am DATE, it is not that old. It is all in your mind. Sir, your administration has indicated interest to appoint a special envoy to the ORG of Islamic Conference, or the ORG. Have you identified the person? And what will he or she do to bridge relations with the NORP countries in the NORP world, in light of the war in GPE and in light of the detention of extremists from NORP countries? First of all, we have not identified the person yet. We are working toward that end. As a matter of fact, I spoke to the Secretary of ORG about this TIME, coincidentally enough. Anyway, we are working the issue. Secondly, the reason why I suggested- or announced that we are going to do this is because I am concerned about the perceptions in the NORP world that GPE views the war on terror as a war against a particular religion. And I just explained to you that this is a war of extremists and radicals, ideologues driven by a vision that is not-that hijacks religion in order to justify their position. And any chance we have to dispel false notion and to reinforce the realities is helpful to GPE and frankly others as well. And so that is the reason to name the envoy. It also is a clear signal that we respect nations and that we treat the NORP world seriously. And you can do that all different kinds of ways. It is another moment for people to see the seriousness of intent. In terms of-murder is murder, and murder to achieve political objectives is-needs to be stopped. People murdered NORP to achieve a political objective. There is a debate in our country whether that is true or not. I have made up my mind. I believe it is absolutely fundamentally true because I am listening to what the enemy says, the enemy of freedom, what they are saying. They say, We want a caliphate, we want to spread our vision. It took a military action, by the way, to liberate people from that vision in GPE. This was not an attack on ORG; this was an attack for liberty. Think about a society in which you CARDINAL could not function in what you are doing because of your gender. Because the vision of these people-who murder the innocent, by the way, to achieve their vision-is that women are not equal. And it just so happened that, given the way the world is DATE, that that kind of ideologue provided safe haven for people who plotted and killed people in our country. CARDINAL, I am not going to stand for it; I am going to protect GPE, just like any other leader would protect their own country. And CARDINAL, CARDINAL way to achieve long-term peace is to help people realize forms of government that give hope. And so whether it be in GPE and GPE, we are helping people realize the blessings of freedom. Freedom yields peace. Forms of government matter. And so the ambassador to the ORG or the President or any other representative of GPE will be expressing this deep desire to work together to achieve peace. ENTITY, what do you think you have achieved with regards to GPE ties with Asia during your time in office? In other words, we are making progress. The first step was to get people to the table, to remind people that it is just not GPE with responsibility. The purpose of the-getting all QUANTITY of us to the table is so that if GPE tried to say, Well, I am really-I said I was going to do it, but I am not going to do it, then there is somebody else also saying, And here are the consequences. And now it is beginning to work because they are verifiably beginning to shut down the reactor. And so we have got more to do. Unfinished is kind of a loaded word, in a way. But I am not-we are not in control of- we are in control of putting the process in place and making sure it is consequential if somebody does not go forward. But it is the leader of GPE who gets to the make the decision. I have made my choice. Let me reiterate a little bit of what I said earlier. The definition of successful foreign policy is to be in a position to work with others to solve problems. And this administration has worked hard to be in a position to convince others to work together to solve problems. I have just outlined some of the problems, some of the problems-whether or not trade is open and people are treated fairly. CARDINAL classic example of this is intellectual property rights. I know that is a deep concern to your Government, just like it is to all our governments, that if you are trading with a country, you want to make sure that those intellectual property rights are treated respectfully. And in some societies, it is difficult. And therefore, we have to be in a position to work collaboratively and bilaterally to convince countries that in order to be a part of the international world, you have to honor contract. And CARDINAL contract is, you do not steal somebody else's intellectual property. But nevertheless, those kind of relationships exist now; we are able to have those kind of dialogs. There is been a lot of cooperation on the security front in remarkable ways since I have been President. The leadership of your country knows full well the dangers of extremism prevailing and have been very strong in working, for example, on the Proliferation Security Initiative. This is an initiative where many ORG nations have agreed to help find and stop the shipment of materiels which could end up in the hands of extremists and radicals that could harm us. And it took a while to get this relationship in place. But it is a relationship that is necessary to help prevent weapons of mass destruction from being moved. And here is a classic case of a successful collaborative effort. The biggest danger we have, it seems like to me, is isolationism and protectionism becoming prevalent philosophies. CARDINAL of the things that this administration has done in working with our friends is to work hard to explain to people the beneficial nature of trading together. And therefore-and that is manifested, by the way, in, for example, the free trade agreement with GPE, which was not a given. And there were some difficulties to overcome in GPE and in GPE, but nevertheless, we got it done. And entering into free trade agreements with other nations, such as GPE, has been good ways of making sure that we codify the benefits of open trading relationships. And so there is been a lot of progress made, and the NORP issue is the issue that we are spending a lot of time on and, hopefully, we can get completed. Just to the domestic scene, we have got Federal elections, as you know, coming up in GPE. Last time around, you had some comments with regards to the then opposition leader's policies on GPE. You described his policy of withdrawal from GPE as disastrous. You have a one-on-CARDINAL meeting with the opposition leader, PERSON; he is ahead in the polls. He is also got a policy in GPE which talks about withdrawal, albeit with caveats. I am just wondering, what is your view of the opposition leader, PERSON? What will you discuss in the meeting? And what do you make of his GPE policy? Yes, first of all, I think it makes sense for me to reach out to leading political figures when I go to other countries. And so I am looking forward to this meeting. I do not know much about him, frankly. Obviously, I have not -maybe I met him; I do not remember meeting him. When I spoke to the Parliament-- I am going to remind him that, CARDINAL, the stakes in GPE are very high for peace; that the liberation of a country-that country was important for peace; and that a democracy-NORP-style democracy in the heart of the Middle East is part of winning this ideological struggle. So the first thing I am going to do is explain to him my views about this-the world in which we live. And I will remind him that, as far as I am concerned, that leaving GPE before the job is done will cause an enemy that attacked us before to become emboldened. And as PERSON put it, to think the enemy will stay there and not follow us here is- in other words, we leave before the job is done, they will follow us home. That-I will remind him that the best way to conduct policy is based upon conditions on the ground; that success is important; that conditions ought to be driving troop deployments. And that is how-I will tell him how-what I would hope all our coalition partners would view the situation in GPE and GPE. Having said that, I do appreciate very much the fact that the NORP have sacrificed and have served. And I am looking forward to seeing some NORP troops with Prime Minister PERSON to thank them and, as importantly, thank their families for joining GPE and a lot of other countries in the great cause of liberation and peace. It is going to be an interesting trip, and what is interesting about these trips is that the time around the table with leaders is important, but also the time sitting down with individuals is important as well. It is a good opportunity to conduct foreign policy. And as I told you, a lot of foreign policy, for me, is the capacity to just look at somebody in the eye and tell them what I think and listen to what they think. It is finding that common ground, if possible, to solve problems. And sometimes you can solve problems by anticipating them and putting the conditions in place so that they will not arise in the first place. And sometimes they just show up, and you better be in a position to deal with them. Can I just clarify something? PERSON is-his theater-he is talked about the importance of GPE, talking about withdrawing our troops from GPE. That he is determined to-he has determined that the issue on Afghanistan- to keep troops in GPE. I view both GPE and GPE as theaters of the same war against radicals and extremists and look forward to sharing my views with Mr. PERSON, of course, and continue our discussions, strategic discussions with PERSON. My next question would touch on NORP cleric PERSON. As you might know, since he was released from jail, has been exercising activities like any other citizens, including recently-DATE he inaugurated a long march participated by CARDINAL of his followers, in connection with that commemoration, or welcoming DATE NORP fasting DATE. Actually, how close has your Government monitored the activities of PERSON? First of all, I did not know he led a parade of CARDINAL people. So that may answer your first question. I am sure our Embassy is aware of the activities that take place in your country. I mean, you are a free country where people are allowed to express themselves in the public square, which is a sign of a healthy society. I am concerned, however, about anybody who preaches violence and extremism and radicalism in a world in which innocent people just get simply murdered for ideological purposes. There were some terrible murders in your country, as you know, just like in mine, and I am confident that by far the vast majority-all of GPE rejects that kind of behavior. Innocent people were killed in GPE for no other reason than they just happened to be vacationing and because somebody wanted to send a political message because they are involved with this ideological struggle. And those of us who want there to be peace have got to reject this kind of behavior. And so your Government is a government of law; your Government will conduct itself according to your laws. But anybody who preaches that kind of violence in the name of what I would call a dark political vision needs to be taken seriously. My next question is about the GPE relationship and the war on terror. The opposition party in GPE is threatening to cut the extension of NORP participation in the antiterrorism operations in the Indian Ocean. Are you concerned about that? And will you be-will you raise this issue when you will meet Prime Minister PERSON in GPE? First of all, GPE has been a positive contributor to dealing with the extremists in this ideological war. And I thank ORG and the people of GPE for their contributions. And I would hope that they would continue to maintain this-their positive influence. And of course, my conversations with Prime Minister PERSON, whom I respect a great deal, will center on the war on terror, as well as a lot of other key issues. GPE has played a significant role in many of the things we have discussed here, like Proliferation Security Initiative, CARDINAL-party talks. They have been a constructive partner in peace, and I will-we will talk about all aspects of our relationship. ENTITY, DATE,GPE celebrates its 50th-- Fiftieth-make sure my congratulatory remarks get in your article. PERSON Congratulates GPE. Do you think that is what it will say? It also marks the 50th relations between the GPE and GPE So what are your outlook and hopes for GPE relations, and especially with GPE being the 10th largest trading partner? First of all, I do believe we ought to have-take this notion of trade and have meaningful discussions with a potential free trade agreement with GPE. Secondly, I respect Prime Minister PERSON, admire his leadership. When his wife died, I tried to call him early just to let him know I cared about him. I will congratulate him. Do not put that in the article, that you had to tell me that. You can put it in there if you want. I will be glad to-I am going to congratulate him. You did congratulate him. I am going to congratulate him again. I will double the congratulations. That is right; I did write him a note. Did I call him or write him a note? You wrote him a note. Anyway, GPE is an interesting example of how a free society can deal with movements that could conceivably change and alter the nature of the free society. And I respect the way the Prime Minister has used freedom and used the openness of society to kind of deal with frustration. I mean, all societies have frustrated people. And the question is, will the outlet of that frustration lead to violence or lead to peace? And GPE is an example of a country where frustrations have been channeled in a constructive way. And therefore, he is a leader, as far as I am concerned, and a very constructive force for Southeast Asia. By the way, I am going to meet with the ORG leaders, which is an important meeting as well. It is an opportunity for GPE to stay very much engaged with ORG. I unfortunately will not be there for the 60th, but look forward to having an event that would kind of recognize the importance of ORG as far as GPE is concerned. So this is a side meeting with the ORG leaders after ORG meeting, sir? I try to do that every time. So they will have somebody like-I will sit down and meet with the ORG nations as well. The other thing that is interesting about GPE is, they are going to be one of the leaders on alternative fuels. I believe that it is in our interests that we develop the technologies necessary to deal with energy dependence as well as greenhouse gases. Back to the climate changes-the way-if you are truly interested in dealing with greenhouse gases, people need to focus on the development of technologies that will enable us to, on the CARDINAL hand, grow our economies, on the other hand, be good stewards of the environment. Just for the record-and this probably will not be a headline, although I have tried to make it one a lot-when it comes time to climate change, there is CARDINAL major industrialized nation that actually grew its economy and reduced greenhouse gases; that would be GPE that actually had greenhouse gases go down and the economy go up. So something is working here, and it is technologies, use of technologies. And so I am going to be reminding people about-that we can come up with a strategy that does not impoverish our people and, at the same time, takes advantage of technologies. And we are going to need to share some technologies with newly emerging economies in order to achieve this objective. Anyway, I forgot to make that point. I am not making the point to you, as you can tell. That is why I am kind of looking over your shoulder. There appears to be a perception in Southeast Asia that this administration has neglected the region. How do you plan to convince them otherwise when you meet in ORG? Well, I-do you want to ask another question, because I already answered it. I will be glad to answer it again- which is, we have got strong bilateral-first of all, the number of trips I have taken- I have gone to every ORG meeting. I have spent a lot of time with leaders both here and in your respective countries-that we have got relations to a point where we can work together to solve common problems. PSI is CARDINAL such example of a strategy we have implemented to deal with the realities of the world. And so it is -the truth of the matter is, I spend a lot of time working on NORP matters. And all I will ask you to do is look at the results of the individual relationships and the ability to put processes in place to deal with the threats we live in and the capacity to work together to solve problems and to create opportunities. And to me, that is a sign of a healthy, robust relationship with an important part of the world.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintmedia0", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Media", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-media-0", "publication_date": "30-08-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 12, "text": "I am looking forward to my trip. This is the seventh ORG summit that I have been to. I find them to be important for GPE in the following ways. CARDINAL, it is an opportunity to stress the importance that we place upon basic values, basic value of liberty, basic value of open markets in order to enhance prosperity. It is a chance to remind people that we are linked together. It is an interesting setting, when you have people from different cultures, different languages come together for a common purpose. It is also a chance for me to remind our country how important it is to have constructive ties in Asia. Asia is a place where we have spilt a lot of blood in the past, and now it is a place of peace. Asia is a place where GPE was engaged militarily, and now we are engaged culturally and socially and economically in a way that is constructive for our peoples. It will be an opportunity for-remind me that it is possible for enemies to be allies and for enemies to be friends. It is a lesson for a lot of us to think about when we think about the Middle East, that forms of government matter and hopeful societies yield peace. I am looking forward to the discussions about trade. The first priority for trade for me at the meeting will be on GPE. I am a firm believer in free trade. I believe the GPE round is the best opportunity for us to accomplish a couple of objectives. CARDINAL is to fight off protectionism and trade freely, and secondly is to help eliminate poverty. This will be an opportunity for the leaders of the ORG summit to express their desire to see the GPE round succeed. We will take the lead in that, along with other nations. There is also an opportunity for us to start talking about a free trade agreement of the Pacific region. And I am looking forward to having that dialog, begin the dialog. It would just be kind of an interesting opportunity to have the dialog on this aspect of our strategic partnership there and to move forward. We have got a lot of-we have got some free trade agreements with people, and that will be at the table. Opportunity for me to continue to talk about the struggle between radicalism and reasonableness, between extremism and people that want to live in peace. I happen to believe-I am sure you have heard me say this-that we are in a major ideological struggle-a struggle we will win, by the way. But it is going to require resolve and dedication. And this will be an opportunity for me to remind our friends at the table that this is the call of our time and that we have an opportunity to write a hopeful chapter here in DATE and to thank people around the table for understanding this is the call of the time, because there is been a lot of constructive engagement and good work, all aimed at protecting ourselves from short-term attack-in the short term from attack and recognizing that changing conditions of life in the long term will enable us to live in peace. And finally, I am looking forward to reminding people that I take the climate change issue seriously; that we recognize that there needs to be international-an international accord to get people at the table who are the major emitters to set a goal. Step CARDINAL to solving a problem is to set the goal on what we ought to achieve. If you want somebody to be a part of the problem-a part of the solution, you need to let them be a part of defining what the goal ought to be. So many of the people at the ORG table are going to come to the major economy conference that-those of us who are emitters will be there, including GPE, which will be at the table. I do not want to single GPE out, but GPE has got a major role to play. Any agreement without GPE is not going to be an effective agreement. So my strategy has been to get GPE at the table. We will further the dialog. PERSON has got some very interesting ways to further the dialog in a constructive way, particularly talking about energy usage. So we will be looking forward to his leadership on the issue. When I told him I was looking forward to coming, we discussed this issue. He is concerned about greenhouse gases. And so he will take the lead here at the conference, and GPE will play a constructive role. We have got a big agenda. It is my second trip to GPE. I remind people that GPE-parts of GPE reminds me of GPE--and there is no higher compliment. I think on behalf of all of us, I can say thank you very much for this opportunity DATE. As you have just analyzed, ENTITY, obviously GPE and the Middle East, the war on terror is an overarching policy issue for the PERSON administration. Nonetheless, there has been a perception in the region that this has distracted GPE from engagement in Asia. Some people are calling this the Pacific DATE. You are cutting short your trip to GPE because of the GPE issue. I am just wondering, do you think that is warranted, that criticism, and do you see GPE, for instance, playing the role-the driver in DATE, not the GPE? No, it is interesting, first of all, this administration has got good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE, good bilateral relations with GPE. Our relationship with the ORG countries are as strong as GPE has ever been, and of course our ties with GPE are tight, really tight. And the reason I say that is, is that this just does not happen without work. And I have worked hard to develop bilateral relations in such a way that we can achieve strategic objectives. I believe the relations with GPE and the Asian-Pacific region have never been better, and as a result, we are addressing problems and creating opportunities. CARDINAL problem, of course, is GPE. When I came into office, the world was expecting GPE to solve the GPE issue alone. To me-and the NORP leader had basically not honored the bilateral agreement that had been struck, and therefore, felt like we needed to put this issue in a position in which others were speaking besides GPE-and have started the CARDINAL-party talks. CARDINAL countries were convinced to come to the table on CARDINAL side to convince the NORP leader to give up his nuclear weapons ambitions. That would not have happened without engagement and good, solid relations. Another issue obviously is our bilateral relations with GPE. It is the same-you are in a little different position in that you have got a nice trade surplus with GPE. We have got a trade deficit with GPE. And it is important for us to have a-given the complexity of our relationship, that we have got a strategic relationship that allows for engagement and for us to help deal with a major trade deficit, for example, and/or product safety or a SARS outbreak. Secretary PERSON-I empowered Secretary PERSON to develop this special working relationship with GPE. And it requires a lot of engagement. It requires engagement at the top, with President PERSON, who I respect, as well as people in my ORG. For those who argue that, they really have not -frankly have not followed how engaged we have been. Is GPE an issue for the world? But I do not view it as a negative issue; I view it as an opportunity to work with a-one of the really significantly growing economies in the world. First, I view that a growing middle class in GPE is good for GPE exporters. It provides opportunity. And it is -by the way, it is not only good for GPE exports; it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP exporters, and it is good for NORP, NORP. Anybody who is making a product somebody wants, it is just a good opportunity. And so as a part of our engagement with GPE, we have worked with PERSON to convince him to help convert his economy from one of savers to one of consumers, which means-and by the way, that takes a lot of effort and work to get in a position where you can even make those kind of constructive suggestions-which means the development of a pension system or health care, so that people do not feel like they have to hoard their money to save for a rainy day, but in fact, there is some kind of safety net that is predictable, which then would convert a NORP person who is beginning to realize better income into a consumer. And then all of a sudden, you have got consumers, which provide opportunity. Huge economic opportunity-you see GPE as the big grower of the economy in the Asia Pacific? No, I see GPE as the big driver for trade. At ORG, people ought to be wondering whether or not PERSON is going to keep taxes low to make sure our economy continues to grow, because we are a significant trading partner. I view GPE as an opportunity. I think GPE is going to drive a lot of the trade. That is why we conducted-now, having said that, I think GPE will provide opportunity for NORP producers, but we also provide the same opportunity. I do not view it as a CARDINAL-sum game, let me put it to you that way. I view it as an-I view-all of us contribute, so long as the world does not slip into protectionism. And part of the reason one goes to ORG is to promote trade and opportunity. And how do you plan to win the hearts and win the markets in the world, including in NORP countries like GPE? Well, I think, first of all, we have a complex relationship with GPE. GPE strongly supports markets. On the other hand, we also support open societies, transparency, where people are allowed to express themselves in a free society. I believe in freedom of religion. I believe in basic freedoms. So our relationship with GPE is, on the CARDINAL hand, we welcome trading opportunities. And what makes the relationship even more complex is, at the same time, we believe in human rights and human dignity. And we worked with the NORP leadership to promote human rights and human dignity. So it is not-it is hard to define the relationship in kind of a simple, CARDINAL-sentence structure. As I told you, I view GPE as a positive opportunity. I like him; I like to talk to him. We can share issues together. And he can say to me, What are your problems? In other words, we have got a personal relationship. And that is the way I try to do with all leaders because the best diplomacy is when you can sit down with somebody one on CARDINAL and speak candidly about issues and problems. See, that is what leaders do. You see problems and you anticipate problems and work together to accomplish something. I have also got a very good relationship with your leader. And so bilateral relations-first of all, in the NORP world, it is very important for people to understand that the war on terror is not a war against NORP; it is a war against murderers. I do not believe religious people, truly religious people kill the innocent. And therefore, it is important for leaders and countries to work together to prevent the murder of the innocent and, at the same time, make sure that we respect-GPE, in my case, respects religion, values the right for people to worship, and, in the case of ORG, values ORG as an important part of the international scene in the world we live in. Yes, well, I am better for it. I have a question on GPE. Is it possible that GPE will give up nuclear weapons program by the end of your term? And to help achieve it, are you ready to remove GPE from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, even without the resolution of NORP abductee issue? As to the first part of your question, I certainly hope that GPE honors its agreements. They-in DATE, they made a substantial agreement to disclose and dismantle all aspects of a nuclear weapons program. And here we are in DATE, DATE, where we are still reminding them of that agreement. On the other hand, a lot has happened in DATE that would lead me to believe that we are on- we are making progress. And we will continue to push toward the full disclosure and dismantlement. Secondly, we have-different aspects of our relationship are on the table, but it is performance based. In other words, we expect people to honor their agreements. Finally, as I assured Prime Minister PERSON, that we are not going to forget the abductee issue. He and the NORP people are very concerned that once certain aspects of the agreement are achieved, that we will forget the fact that NORP citizens have been abducted. ENTITY. I will never forget the meeting I had with the mother-it is very important for your readers to know that that had a deep impression on me- the mother whose daughter was abducted by NORP. I cannot imagine what that would mean. I guess I can imagine what it would mean; I just cannot understand, fully understand the pain that she felt-still feels. And I will never forget her coming to FAC with the picture of that little girl, picture of her daughter who got abducted. She sat right there in FAC. And my point to you is, is that I am not going to forget the mother or forget the fact. And so we will work with the-continue to work with the NORP to make it clear to NORP that we also expect there to be resolution to this issue. In other words, I understand, as well as I possibly can, the emotion that people attach to this issue. But now that I am DATE, it is not that old. It is all in your mind. Sir, your administration has indicated interest to appoint a special envoy to the ORG of Islamic Conference, or the ORG. Have you identified the person? And what will he or she do to bridge relations with the NORP countries in the NORP world, in light of the war in GPE and in light of the detention of extremists from NORP countries? First of all, we have not identified the person yet. We are working toward that end. As a matter of fact, I spoke to the Secretary of ORG about this TIME, coincidentally enough. Anyway, we are working the issue. Secondly, the reason why I suggested- or announced that we are going to do this is because I am concerned about the perceptions in the NORP world that GPE views the war on terror as a war against a particular religion. And I just explained to you that this is a war of extremists and radicals, ideologues driven by a vision that is not-that hijacks religion in order to justify their position. And any chance we have to dispel false notion and to reinforce the realities is helpful to GPE and frankly others as well. And so that is the reason to name the envoy. It also is a clear signal that we respect nations and that we treat the NORP world seriously. And you can do that all different kinds of ways. It is another moment for people to see the seriousness of intent. In terms of-murder is murder, and murder to achieve political objectives is-needs to be stopped. People murdered NORP to achieve a political objective. There is a debate in our country whether that is true or not. I have made up my mind. I believe it is absolutely fundamentally true because I am listening to what the enemy says, the enemy of freedom, what they are saying. They say, We want a caliphate, we want to spread our vision. It took a military action, by the way, to liberate people from that vision in GPE. This was not an attack on ORG; this was an attack for liberty. Think about a society in which you CARDINAL could not function in what you are doing because of your gender. Because the vision of these people-who murder the innocent, by the way, to achieve their vision-is that women are not equal. And it just so happened that, given the way the world is DATE, that that kind of ideologue provided safe haven for people who plotted and killed people in our country. CARDINAL, I am not going to stand for it; I am going to protect GPE, just like any other leader would protect their own country. And CARDINAL, CARDINAL way to achieve long-term peace is to help people realize forms of government that give hope. And so whether it be in GPE and GPE, we are helping people realize the blessings of freedom. Freedom yields peace. Forms of government matter. And so the ambassador to the ORG or the President or any other representative of GPE will be expressing this deep desire to work together to achieve peace. ENTITY, what do you think you have achieved with regards to GPE ties with Asia during your time in office? In other words, we are making progress. The first step was to get people to the table, to remind people that it is just not GPE with responsibility. The purpose of the-getting all QUANTITY of us to the table is so that if GPE tried to say, Well, I am really-I said I was going to do it, but I am not going to do it, then there is somebody else also saying, And here are the consequences. And now it is beginning to work because they are verifiably beginning to shut down the reactor. And so we have got more to do. Unfinished is kind of a loaded word, in a way. But I am not-we are not in control of- we are in control of putting the process in place and making sure it is consequential if somebody does not go forward. But it is the leader of GPE who gets to the make the decision. I have made my choice. Let me reiterate a little bit of what I said earlier. The definition of successful foreign policy is to be in a position to work with others to solve problems. And this administration has worked hard to be in a position to convince others to work together to solve problems. I have just outlined some of the problems, some of the problems-whether or not trade is open and people are treated fairly. CARDINAL classic example of this is intellectual property rights. I know that is a deep concern to your Government, just like it is to all our governments, that if you are trading with a country, you want to make sure that those intellectual property rights are treated respectfully. And in some societies, it is difficult. And therefore, we have to be in a position to work collaboratively and bilaterally to convince countries that in order to be a part of the international world, you have to honor contract. And CARDINAL contract is, you do not steal somebody else's intellectual property. But nevertheless, those kind of relationships exist now; we are able to have those kind of dialogs. There is been a lot of cooperation on the security front in remarkable ways since I have been President. The leadership of your country knows full well the dangers of extremism prevailing and have been very strong in working, for example, on the Proliferation Security Initiative. This is an initiative where many ORG nations have agreed to help find and stop the shipment of materiels which could end up in the hands of extremists and radicals that could harm us. And it took a while to get this relationship in place. But it is a relationship that is necessary to help prevent weapons of mass destruction from being moved. And here is a classic case of a successful collaborative effort. The biggest danger we have, it seems like to me, is isolationism and protectionism becoming prevalent philosophies. CARDINAL of the things that this administration has done in working with our friends is to work hard to explain to people the beneficial nature of trading together. And therefore-and that is manifested, by the way, in, for example, the free trade agreement with GPE, which was not a given. And there were some difficulties to overcome in GPE and in GPE, but nevertheless, we got it done. And entering into free trade agreements with other nations, such as GPE, has been good ways of making sure that we codify the benefits of open trading relationships. And so there is been a lot of progress made, and the NORP issue is the issue that we are spending a lot of time on and, hopefully, we can get completed. Just to the domestic scene, we have got Federal elections, as you know, coming up in GPE. Last time around, you had some comments with regards to the then opposition leader's policies on GPE. You described his policy of withdrawal from GPE as disastrous. You have a one-on-CARDINAL meeting with the opposition leader, PERSON; he is ahead in the polls. He is also got a policy in GPE which talks about withdrawal, albeit with caveats. I am just wondering, what is your view of the opposition leader, PERSON? What will you discuss in the meeting? And what do you make of his GPE policy? Yes, first of all, I think it makes sense for me to reach out to leading political figures when I go to other countries. And so I am looking forward to this meeting. I do not know much about him, frankly. Obviously, I have not -maybe I met him; I do not remember meeting him. When I spoke to the Parliament-- I am going to remind him that, CARDINAL, the stakes in GPE are very high for peace; that the liberation of a country-that country was important for peace; and that a democracy-NORP-style democracy in the heart of the Middle East is part of winning this ideological struggle. So the first thing I am going to do is explain to him my views about this-the world in which we live. And I will remind him that, as far as I am concerned, that leaving GPE before the job is done will cause an enemy that attacked us before to become emboldened. And as PERSON put it, to think the enemy will stay there and not follow us here is- in other words, we leave before the job is done, they will follow us home. That-I will remind him that the best way to conduct policy is based upon conditions on the ground; that success is important; that conditions ought to be driving troop deployments. And that is how-I will tell him how-what I would hope all our coalition partners would view the situation in GPE and GPE. Having said that, I do appreciate very much the fact that the NORP have sacrificed and have served. And I am looking forward to seeing some NORP troops with Prime Minister PERSON to thank them and, as importantly, thank their families for joining GPE and a lot of other countries in the great cause of liberation and peace. It is going to be an interesting trip, and what is interesting about these trips is that the time around the table with leaders is important, but also the time sitting down with individuals is important as well. It is a good opportunity to conduct foreign policy. And as I told you, a lot of foreign policy, for me, is the capacity to just look at somebody in the eye and tell them what I think and listen to what they think. It is finding that common ground, if possible, to solve problems. And sometimes you can solve problems by anticipating them and putting the conditions in place so that they will not arise in the first place. And sometimes they just show up, and you better be in a position to deal with them. Can I just clarify something? PERSON is-his theater-he is talked about the importance of GPE, talking about withdrawing our troops from GPE. That he is determined to-he has determined that the issue on Afghanistan- to keep troops in GPE. I view both GPE and GPE as theaters of the same war against radicals and extremists and look forward to sharing my views with Mr. PERSON, of course, and continue our discussions, strategic discussions with PERSON. My next question would touch on NORP cleric PERSON. As you might know, since he was released from jail, has been exercising activities like any other citizens, including recently-DATE he inaugurated a long march participated by CARDINAL of his followers, in connection with that commemoration, or welcoming DATE NORP fasting DATE. Actually, how close has your Government monitored the activities of PERSON? First of all, I did not know he led a parade of CARDINAL people. So that may answer your first question. I am sure our Embassy is aware of the activities that take place in your country. I mean, you are a free country where people are allowed to express themselves in the public square, which is a sign of a healthy society. I am concerned, however, about anybody who preaches violence and extremism and radicalism in a world in which innocent people just get simply murdered for ideological purposes. There were some terrible murders in your country, as you know, just like in mine, and I am confident that by far the vast majority-all of GPE rejects that kind of behavior. Innocent people were killed in GPE for no other reason than they just happened to be vacationing and because somebody wanted to send a political message because they are involved with this ideological struggle. And those of us who want there to be peace have got to reject this kind of behavior. And so your Government is a government of law; your Government will conduct itself according to your laws. But anybody who preaches that kind of violence in the name of what I would call a dark political vision needs to be taken seriously. My next question is about the GPE relationship and the war on terror. The opposition party in GPE is threatening to cut the extension of NORP participation in the antiterrorism operations in the Indian Ocean. Are you concerned about that? And will you be-will you raise this issue when you will meet Prime Minister PERSON in GPE? First of all, GPE has been a positive contributor to dealing with the extremists in this ideological war. And I thank ORG and the people of GPE for their contributions. And I would hope that they would continue to maintain this-their positive influence. And of course, my conversations with Prime Minister PERSON, whom I respect a great deal, will center on the war on terror, as well as a lot of other key issues. GPE has played a significant role in many of the things we have discussed here, like Proliferation Security Initiative, CARDINAL-party talks. They have been a constructive partner in peace, and I will-we will talk about all aspects of our relationship. ENTITY, DATE,GPE celebrates its 50th-- Fiftieth-make sure my congratulatory remarks get in your article. PERSON Congratulates GPE. Do you think that is what it will say? It also marks the 50th relations between the GPE and GPE So what are your outlook and hopes for GPE relations, and especially with GPE being the 10th largest trading partner? First of all, I do believe we ought to have-take this notion of trade and have meaningful discussions with a potential free trade agreement with GPE. Secondly, I respect Prime Minister PERSON, admire his leadership. When his wife died, I tried to call him early just to let him know I cared about him. I will congratulate him. Do not put that in the article, that you had to tell me that. You can put it in there if you want. I will be glad to-I am going to congratulate him. You did congratulate him. I am going to congratulate him again. I will double the congratulations. That is right; I did write him a note. Did I call him or write him a note? You wrote him a note. Anyway, GPE is an interesting example of how a free society can deal with movements that could conceivably change and alter the nature of the free society. And I respect the way the Prime Minister has used freedom and used the openness of society to kind of deal with frustration. I mean, all societies have frustrated people. And the question is, will the outlet of that frustration lead to violence or lead to peace? And GPE is an example of a country where frustrations have been channeled in a constructive way. And therefore, he is a leader, as far as I am concerned, and a very constructive force for Southeast Asia. By the way, I am going to meet with the ORG leaders, which is an important meeting as well. It is an opportunity for GPE to stay very much engaged with ORG. I unfortunately will not be there for the 60th, but look forward to having an event that would kind of recognize the importance of ORG as far as GPE is concerned. So this is a side meeting with the ORG leaders after ORG meeting, sir? I try to do that every time. So they will have somebody like-I will sit down and meet with the ORG nations as well. The other thing that is interesting about GPE is, they are going to be one of the leaders on alternative fuels. I believe that it is in our interests that we develop the technologies necessary to deal with energy dependence as well as greenhouse gases. Back to the climate changes-the way-if you are truly interested in dealing with greenhouse gases, people need to focus on the development of technologies that will enable us to, on the CARDINAL hand, grow our economies, on the other hand, be good stewards of the environment. Just for the record-and this probably will not be a headline, although I have tried to make it one a lot-when it comes time to climate change, there is CARDINAL major industrialized nation that actually grew its economy and reduced greenhouse gases; that would be GPE that actually had greenhouse gases go down and the economy go up. So something is working here, and it is technologies, use of technologies. And so I am going to be reminding people about-that we can come up with a strategy that does not impoverish our people and, at the same time, takes advantage of technologies. And we are going to need to share some technologies with newly emerging economies in order to achieve this objective. Anyway, I forgot to make that point. I am not making the point to you, as you can tell. That is why I am kind of looking over your shoulder. There appears to be a perception in Southeast Asia that this administration has neglected the region. How do you plan to convince them otherwise when you meet in ORG? Well, I-do you want to ask another question, because I already answered it. I will be glad to answer it again- which is, we have got strong bilateral-first of all, the number of trips I have taken- I have gone to every ORG meeting. I have spent a lot of time with leaders both here and in your respective countries-that we have got relations to a point where we can work together to solve common problems. PSI is CARDINAL such example of a strategy we have implemented to deal with the realities of the world. And so it is -the truth of the matter is, I spend a lot of time working on NORP matters. And all I will ask you to do is look at the results of the individual relationships and the ability to put processes in place to deal with the threats we live in and the capacity to work together to solve problems and to create opportunities. And to me, that is a sign of a healthy, robust relationship with an important part of the world.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintmedia0", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Media", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-media-0", "publication_date": "30-08-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 13, "text": "I am very much looking forward to the trip. This will be my second trip to the continent of Africa, my wife's fifth trip. The reason why I am looking forward to it is I want the people on the continent of Africa to know that the NORP people care deeply about the human condition; that when we see suffering, it troubles our conscience, and we want to help. I believe to whom much is given, much is required. A lot has been given to GPE, and therefore, a lot is required of us to deal with human misery in the form of hunger and disease and hopelessness. And so this is going to be a trip that I bring the good will of NORP people, with a strategy to help nations deal with the problems they have. I appreciate the leadership on the continent of Africa, and I am looking forward to working with the leaders there as partners in solving some of the problems that I believe can be solved. I'd be glad to answer questions. I am ENTITY from GPE. Well, people from my country are very delighted to welcome you on DATE. And I wish to say what they are expecting from you and from GPE. You, President PERSON, have said that the best way we can build a peaceful world for the future is to share the principle of freedom with other nations. I took this from the ORG site-this is a word I appreciate. But we highly appreciate how your Government fight poverty and encourage growth building. But we would like all this take place in a perfectly democratic context. Democracy is a commitment by government and by people. The people of GPE have committed to democracy. In my country, we are a great democracy. After all, we enslaved people. And democracy is work and requires a lot of work. And it requires support from-to help leaders deal with everyday problems. CARDINAL such problem in GPE is malaria. Your President has made a strong commitment to help eradicate malaria. DATE, in a speech that inaugurated my trip-or kicked off my trip, I talked about your President's commitment to provide nets to every child DATE and under. These are significant aid programs, but they are given to countries that adhere to rule of law and fight corruption and invest in the health and education of their people. This is a different type of foreign policy. It is a different type of foreign aid. Foreign aid in the past was just, here, take and spend. This is foreign policy that reinforces the conditions necessary for just and peaceful societies to develop. And so I am looking forward to confirming our desire to help and reinforcing the President's desire to achieve a democracy in which people have got confidence. I am ENTITY from GPE.  He is a good guy, yes, and we are happy to receive the ORG money, which we are about to receive when you come down to GPE. Now my question is that GPE is among CARDINAL countries that have benefited from the GPE initiative on HIV/AIDS, ORG program, as well as the malaria initiative. But being an undeveloped country, while-would expect that to see more assistance in terms of helping poor countries such as GPE develop economically. So I'd like to know, as you are winding your term in office, what commitment has GPE made to ensure that developing countries such as GPE is assisted in terms of trade and development issues and private sector development as well? First of all, just in general, our commitment to the continent of Africa was doubled when I first came into office, and then when I got- started my second term, doubled again. Secondly, I do agree that the most substantive way to help any developing nation is through the development of commerce and wealth as a result of growing industry and businesses, both small and large. And the best way to foster that is through trade. And that is why ORG, passed by my predecessor, reauthorized during my Presidency, is a great source of hope for people on the continent of Africa because they now have a market in which to sell. Exports to GPE from the continent of Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, have tripled. Exports from GPE to sub-Saharan Africa have doubled. In other words, this trade has been good. CARDINAL way to firm up the commitment to make sure that our Nation remains nonprotectionist-in other words, a free-trading nation-is to complete the GPE round. That is a difficult set of negotiations. GPE has made it clear that we will reduce our agricultural subsidies, but in return, we expect other developed nations-and developing-large developing nations-to also reduce their tariffs and subsidies so that I can come to the ORG and say, here is an agreement that is fair for everybody. And so the other thing we can do is- so, our assistance aid, by the way, is help-ing-in some cases helps business. CARDINAL way to do that is through ORG. And I announced DATE a new MONEY of OPIC-type investment funds that will be available for NORP businesses. What is interesting is, capital inflows into Africa now exceed grants, development aid. And that is important because capital inflows means jobs and commerce and hope and small businesses. So our plan is a plan that, hopefully, will sustain the gains that have been made. It is not like a CARDINAL-time shot. It is got structural implications. The other thing is, is that you cannot have a hopeful economy if your people cannot read. And so education is a vital link to providing hope. And we have got a strong education initiative on the continent-and started early in my administration; we are following through on it. We are trying to get, I think, like, CARDINAL textbooks and train CARDINAL teachers and provide scholarships to CARDINAL girls, all aiming to provide a basis by which these investments and these capital flows will actually be able to take hold-and that is an educated workforce, an educated population. You are living in GPE now? And I hope I will be there before you reach, so I can welcome you. You somehow already replied to the question I wanted to ask you, but I can maybe define it a bit more. It is clear that the increase of support of your administration-your CARDINAL mandates-increased a lot. And do not you think the GPE should maybe also develop a higher level political strategy on Africa, that would benefit the GPE and Africa? CARDINAL was, We are feeling terrible for you, here is money, and not much asked in return. You have got resources; we want them. We will exploit them and leave behind something that really does not benefit the people. I know those are extreme cases, but nevertheless, if you really think about the history of supporting Africa, it is CARDINAL way to characterize how things were approached. Some of it had to do with the guilt of colonialism; some of it had to do with just the gluttony of need for raw materials. In either case, it did not work. rule of law, fighting corruption, investment in people through health and education programs, and adherence to the marketplace. Nations that have received Millennium Challenge grants have met a test. What is happening, ENTITY, is that other nations desirous of a Millennium Challenge grant ask, What did you do to get your grant, to other leaders. And so the habits of a just society become an integral part of the receiving of help. We are more than willing to help, but in this case, we are saying the help has got to be to reinforce those decisions by leaders that'll have a long-lasting impact toward a free society. If the people think that the leadership is there to enrich themselves, they will have no trust in government. And so CARDINAL of the criterion for Millennium Challenge is honesty. We want the leadership and government to be honest with the people. And when we first put out-when I first put out this initiative, I was criticized by some. That is just part of the job, evidently. And it was, How dare you insist upon conditions for your aid. Should not we expect good leadership? Should not we have faith in people from a different part of the world demanding the same things that we expect of our Government? The answer is, absolutely we should hold people up to a high standard. Absolutely we should expect leaders to adhere to some basic principle. And absolutely we should trust people to want to live in a free society. And so we changed the policy. Not only did we have a more robust approach to the issues facing NORP than ever before in our Nation's history, by a significant amount, but we have a strategy to do just what you asked. How do we make sure that a free society is lasting, that it is not just a moment-you know, let us just do what old PERSON wants us to do, and then he will go away and then societies can revert back its norm. And so we have-there is a constant evaluation of results based upon high standards. ENTITY, I am impressed by your policy statement on Africa DATE. You were the only people in this room; the rest of them fell asleep back there. But just what I have from the-what I have listened to here now, I am mostly impressed; it is quite encouraging. But I just want to know, what is the motivating factor for the increasing interest in Africa? Well, somebody may say it is the new oil finds or the fight against terrorism or we want to promote democracy. First of all, my passion toward Africa has been sustained throughout DATE. In other words, my speech DATE, if you listened carefully to it, indicated a strategy that was first adopted early in my administration. Now, CARDINAL, conditions of life overseas matters to the security of GPE. In other words, if there is hopelessness, then it is liable that extremists who are recruiting people to create havoc not only in their respective countries or neighborhoods but also in our country-if there is hopelessness, they have a better chance to recruit. So it is in our national security interest, ENTITY, that we deal with the conditions that enable ideologues-the ideologues of hate to recruit. Remember that the ideology that is prevalent, that uses murder as a weapon, cannot recruit in hopeful places. Follow me; my vision is-if you are a female, follow me; my vision is, you have no rights ? Or, If you disagree with my religious interpretations, you will be whipped in the public square. So it is in our national interests. Equally, if not more important, it is in our moral interests that we help people. I firmly believe-as I said earlier, I firmly believe in the admonition that to whom much is given, much is required. I believe that is a principle by which people should make decisions in their individual lives and for the collective conscience of GPE. It is in our moral interest that we help a brother and sister who is dying of AIDS. And by helping that soul, it really helps ourselves. GPE's generosity has been prevalent throughout DATE. And every time GPE reaches out to help a struggling soul, we find that we are a better nation for it. And so my interest and my focus and my insistence upon results on the continent of Africa are based on those CARDINAL premises. The other thing, ENTITY, I will tell you is that I have got a lot of resources-or we have a lot of resources at our disposal. And the idea of an entire generation of people dying because of HIV/AIDS troubled my heart. And I felt like GPE could do something about it. CARDINAL people were receiving antiretroviral drugs when we first started PEPFAR. DATE, CARDINAL people are receiving antiretrovirals in a very short period of time. It is because I could not live with myself if I did not develop an effective strategy and call upon the NORP people to help. And the good news is, the NORP people have responded-$15 billion over CARDINAL. We are now going to double our commitment. The ORG has committed to match the GPE So all of a sudden, the strategy-and most of these strategies, ENTITY, are really based upon-oftentimes when you see human suffering, it is based upon something that affects your heart. And so that is why I have made the decisions I made. Well,ENTITY, I would like to thank you for considering GPE as one of the countries you are going to be visiting this time. And the Government and the people of GPE do appreciate all that you have done for us. Now, ENTITY, DATE, your administration extended by DATE the temporary protective status of CARDINAL of NORP. Now what happens when you leave office? Is your Government considering anything permanent for them, like what most host countries did for NORP refugees, integrating them locally, those who wanted to stay? And those who wanted to go back home, taking them back home? Because this might-it will definitely allow these NORP to continue to contribute to the growth of the economy of the country and also support their families back home. I did extend TPS to NORP here in GPE for, I think, DATE. I would hope that many of the NORP who have come and been fine contributors here in GPE think about going home to help this young country get on its feet after unspeakable violence and terrible times. You have got a great President, in my judgment. I gave her the National Medal of Freedom. After all, she is the first woman President on the continent of Africa. And she-you know, in my speech DATE, I said, Africa's greatest resource is not oils or diamonds or rubber, it is really people. And so, my hope, of course, is that people that have been here trying to save themselves from the violence go help this young-not young, but this country get back on its feet. What kind of name is that, ENTITY? The situation in GPE has always been a matter of great concern for you. ORG officials say that the situation on the ground has been worsening over DATE. Do you think there is a link between the CARDINAL, between GPE and GPE? And where do we go from there? I appreciate that. I do think there is a link, first of all, and I think that-let me just step back and say that GPE has called the situation in GPE a genocide. And I made a decision early on that we would work through ORG to help expedite troops that would help alleve the suffering and provide some breathing space, hopefully, for the negotiations between rebel groups and the ORG. Unfortunately, the rebel groups that were CARDINAL time CARDINAL are now a multiple of CARDINAL. And unfortunately, a government that could have made a difference early on in GPE chose not to do so. So GPE continues to work with the international community to put pressure on ORG. I have issued very harsh sanctions against individuals and NORP companies. I also did so against CARDINAL rebel leader I am aware of, because I wanted to send a signal that your behavior is causing there to be some consequences. We are continually working with other nations to get them to take the same tough approach-nations throughout the world. In terms of the conditions on the ground, CARDINAL thing GPE has done is, we are providing enormous amounts of aid and obviously are concerned as to whether or not that aid makes it into the camps. Secondly is, I have told the folks at ORG that we would provide training and equipment to expedite the movement of troops. CARDINAL way I can help call the world to action is when I am in GPE to thank the troops of GPE, the PERSON Government, for being so proactive. I am frustrated by the pace of development on the ground. I am not pleased that other nations-some other nations do not take necessary steps to pressure the Government. I am-I have named another Envoy to the GPE, whose job it is to really help bring a negotiating framework that will work. And again, I will repeat to you, one of the unfortunate issues has been that the rebel groups have gone from CARDINAL to CARDINAL, I think it is, or CARDINAL, if I am not mistaken. And there needs to be the GPE and others to pull the groups together so that there is somebody to negotiate with- that can speak with-more likely with a unified voice. And I do believe that the instability in GPE affects GPE and NORP interests. And I do thank ORG for being a responsible nation, rallying ORG forces to come and provide some help. And on the other hand, there are some hopeful moments, such as the fact that many in the world are providing help for the people in the camps. The problem is the people who are in the camps. And obviously, we'd like them to get back to their villages. In your first trip to Africa, you embraced President PERSON as the honest broker in GPE. Well, obviously, we are disappointed that the situation in GPE since my first trip has gotten worse. And it is very important for people to recognize types of government can affect the wellbeing and welfare of a country. GPE used to be a net exporter of food. DATE, it is a net importer of food. PERSON has ruined a country, and we have-we and frankly GPE have been the most vociferous advocates for change, and we still are advocates for change. I was hoping that ORG would have been more proactive in its intercession to help the people of GPE. It is not anti anybody; it is pro people, and that has yet to happen, admittedly. Like they say PERSON - -where I am from? ENTITY, I will recommend you, during your short visit to my country, to have a taste in our juicy, tasty, and nicely perfumed pineapples. And then you will figure out that it will be an opportunity for all the NORP people to have a taste-. Because fruits are not a part of the ORG Administration official. Pineapples can be imported under ORG. So then what we are going to have to do is, I am going to have to talk to your President and point out the opportunities that pineapples are a part of the ORG trade list that can enter into GPE relatively duty free. Yes, but apart from the pineapple, we have so many things and so many products that can profit from the ORG but do not-- You need some export credit-I mean, not export credit, you need some help in developing industries that know how to export. Yes, I will be glad to talk to the President about that. Some grant money that encourages people to learn how to be an exporting company, microloans can also help. And so can ORG, which is a way for people to get the capital necessary to be able to develop an infrastructure so that they can take the pineapple from the field, do whatever you are supposed to do, put it in a crate and ship it to GPE for sale-if you know how to market. In other words, this is a-and so yes, we'd like to help enterprise. The whole purpose of our strategy, which is commerce, is much more effective than aid to governments. It is got a more lasting impact. And CARDINAL of the things I am going to do in GPE is visit entrepreneurs that are taking advantage of marketplace access. That is fine; you are talking about nice things. And we like ORG, but you have got to do something about your agriculture, because it provides a distinct disadvantage for our farmers. And my answer is going to be, we are more than willing to do so, but we expect other partners in the world to do the same thing. And this is a tough issue to get all countries to agree to have equity when it comes to reducing our respective subsidies and tariffs, including NORP nations. CARDINAL of the things I point up to NORP leaders-point out to NORP leaders is that oftentimes it is virtually impossible to ship goods from CARDINAL NORP country to the next because there are high intra-Africa tariffs and barriers to trade. And so it is a-trade is complicated, and we just want to be treated fairly in GPE. In order to get something passed, it has to be viewed as a fair and equitable transaction, and I believe we can achieve such a thing. I am looking forward to that pineapple. ENTITY, your Government has been supporting GPE address the issue of corruption as well as good governance through the ORG initiative and through ORG. And it is now been eligible to receive the funds, but what is going to happen once you step down to make sure what is being done-to make sure that it is going to be sustainable-- it will not end with you. There will be a peaceful transfer of power. And yet I am hopeful that we leave behind an institution such as ORG, which has a monitoring device that will more likely assure the people of GPE that DATE's anticorruption measures are for real and lasting. I mean, you know, DATE's concern about corruption may not be DATE's. I suspect any NORP President is going to be worried about corruption, particularly since we have changed how aid is granted in the first place. And so the fact that the Millennium Challenge exists will make it more likely future administrations will ask the very same questions we have asked. Your thing turned off there, by the way, PERSON. ENTITY, you will see when you visit GPE that DATE, after the genocide, GPE has incredibly developed. But for development in GPE, CARDINAL of the things that are key-that is key is security. And when you started your first mandate, there was already a threat, and DATE, the threat is still there, ENTITY. What do you forecast for the future? FDLR. And which are even listed as terrorist organizations, even by the GPE We are working with President PERSON on a disarmament program. We have been very engaged diplomatically in the eastern part of the GPE. I have talked to him about this personally. Our diplomats out of ORG and on the ground are very actively engaged in getting people to honor the agreement. And I fully understand the issue and the concerns. First of all, the amazing thing is, is that the recovery of your country. President PERSON has been a very strong leader in the right sense of the word. I think I said GPE is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, if I am not mistaken. Now, obviously, that is really good news, and, of course, one of the things that is going to matter is that the people benefit from that economic vitality and growth. But you are right, it is one of the ongoing issues that I talked about in my speech DATE, and the reason I did so, is I wanted the President and the people of GPE to know that we understand the seriousness of this issue; that nobody wants a replay of a very difficult-very terrible period in your history. Yes, ENTITY, your planned visit to Africa shows that the continent has become important to you and your country. Well, that is why the administration has set up ORG for development but not for war-- War, war fighting, and then the ORG, Millennium Challenge Account, all for development-but to the ordinary NORP, he or she can see these things clearly or feel the impact well, maybe because of the gravity of the situation or poverty. And CARDINAL way you made mention of it is to trade, not just aid. But we have problem with the NORP culture produced cotton and all that, because of the subsidies here, the effects are depressed prices back in Africa. What is official-what are you doing to solve this problem of subsidies? First of all, if you are a mother who is worried about a child dying of malaria, and you see a net provided by an NORP child, then all of a sudden, the-you get a direct connection between the hearts of NORP and your life. So, in other words, you asked me whether-how does the average person sometimes feel the effects of NORP commitment to the continent? And my answer to you-and I will answer the subsidy thing-but my answer to you is, first of all, it is a very important question, because oftentimes, DATE, aid would never make it beyond the palaces. They would kind of end up in a handful of people's pockets. And our program, ORG, is really aimed at focusing on individuals. If you believe every human life has dignity, therefore, your programs ought to reflect that concept. And the way you do that is you make sure that the aid gets to the people. In this case, we are focusing on problems that affect the people most directly. And so, at DATE, I got a-a couple years ago, I got nets given in my name or in PERSON's name to families on the continent of Africa. I will never know who they were, and they probably do not know who I am, but the idea that an NORP family decided to spend money on a DATE gift aimed at helping a stranger is really an important part of an effective foreign aid policy. Secondly, our AIDS initiative works very closely with the leaders to design programs that meet the needs of the country-not meet our needs but meet your needs. But the other thing that comes with the AIDS program is a great outpouring of faith-based groups from GPE. There are CARDINAL of my citizens, ENTITY, that would-that long to spend time in parts of Africa delivering help to a total stranger. Other countries-I am sure that happens, but I happen to say that this is the greatest strength of GPE. And so there will be, hopefully, somebody in a village in GPE that runs into CARDINAL of these missionaries on a mission of love, that will see the direct help of an AIDS program or a malaria program and education benefits. It may not be that somebody recognizes that a teacher has been trained by GPE dollars, but our policy is to-we are more focused on the person learning. Maybe there will be a benefit to GPE, a direct benefit, where somebody says, wow, this is great; GPE did this. On the other hand, our focus is more on making sure that the child learns to read in the first place, because our overall objective is a hopeful society and a peaceful society. To subsidies, I fully understand the angst about the leadership-by the leadership on GPE subsidies. And I have said I am more than willing to-on the GPE round-by the most effective place-first of all, ORG has helped address that to a certain extent. On the other hand, it has not made your farmers feel more comfortable because of the-in their view, that the GPE farming is not only efficient, but there is a subsidy to make it even more competitive. I understand that. In other words, the GPE farmer is willing to take less of a subsidy if his-can be assured that his product will get a fair hearing in somebody else's market-particularly those that can afford to buy crops on a large scale-and that is not the case. Same thing if we reduce our subsidies on agriculture; we expect other nations to be more opening to manufactured goods and services. And it is a very complex issue, but it is one that we are trying to work through. And hopefully, if we can get a successful GPE round, your very question will be answered in a way that is hopeful to the farmers there in GPE. I know I am not supposed to be asking questions, but-. Some part of my education was in GPE. I am living in GPE right now. This is off the record, right? road construction work, so you can have a safe-- Well, you do not need to worry about me. We are rushing up everything so you can-- You are building things because of my arrival? We have got infrastructure-- Can you see it, a big difference? Those on the ground are feeling safer. But, like, for NORP here in GPE-I have been talking to most of them- for them to go back home and join in this young democracy. And some of the things they have been saying is the security. And some of them went back, after the first bout of war and were forced to come back. Now they keep saying security, and each time, I say, we have the ORG mission down there. But right now the ORG mission is gradually drawing down faces. Now, will your Government consider establishing ORG in GPE, which would consolidate security there? You know, like a couple of the subregions bring in investment into GPE, which is what mostly GPE needs right now. First of all, ORG is a brand new concept aimed at strengthening nations' capacities to deal with trafficking or terror, but also to help nations develop forces capable of doing the peacekeeping that unfortunately too often is needed on the continent. Secondly, we are in the process of evaluating exactly how ORG will work. Now, because it is a new concept, it was a brand new military-type command-and, by the way, it is going to be more than just military; there will be a ORG component with it, which makes it a very interesting issue. And so we are in the process of determining where and how ORG should be situated on the continent. I am not avoiding-I guess I am avoiding your answer, but I do not mean to be avoiding it. I am just telling you exactly where we are in the process. And obviously, if there is going to be a physical presence on the continent of Africa in the forms of a headquarters that you just described, obviously, we would seriously consider GPE. The President has made it abundantly clear to me that she would like us to seriously consider GPE, and I have told her I would. I just want to make sure people understand that the makeup and the construct of ORG is still really being thought through, because, as I mentioned to you, this is not-I mean, when you think of, you know, GPE command structures, you think military, which is fine. But this is a different military mission than ORG, for example. And as I told you, there is going to be a strong ORG component with it, and we are in the process of making sure we understand what that integration means and then evaluating if and where the facilities will be built. It is on my radar screen. Who won this election? And what should be done to stop this violence? I do not think we can say we are certain to who won the election. That is part of the problem. Secondly, there is a way forward, which is for the parties to come together in good faith and work out a way forward until there are new elections, the date of which would be determined by the parties. I do not think GPE ought to go in, or anybody else, to say, You must have an election now. But I do think we can go in and help PERSON convince the parties to work together in a cooperative way so that the people can see there is a way forward. And to this end, when I am in GPE, I am going to ask PERSON to go over to GPE and sit down with the leaders in GPE to see if we cannot help PERSON advance the-PERSON advance the way forward. CARDINAL of the GPE counterterrorism efforts in Africa has centered on the Horn. Any concern about the continuing instability in GPE and, again, worsening relations between GPE and GPE, the impact that that has not only on stability on the Horn but counterterrorism efforts? Yes, we are concerned about instability anywhere, really, but instability is what-and confusion and chaos and fear is the conditions under which a group like ORG can thrive. That is why they like to kill people, innocent people, to create doubt about existing security, to create fear among the population. So any time you see that kind of instability, we are deeply concerned about it. Secondly, there have been ORG some ORG operating out of GPE, and therefore, when you know ORG have been in and out of GPE and there is some chaos and confusion, the conclusion is, we better be worried about it and do something about it. We have got cooperative arrangements in the region that will make it more likely for us to be able to provide protections for the people in the region and ourself. In terms of-yes, and we are also conscious of GPE and GPE's border dispute. And I am constantly talking to PERSON about making sure that we are on top of the situation as the best we can make a positive contribution. I feel pretty comfortable that ORG and our ORG are fully aware of the issues on the border and are making sure that the respective leaders understand the position of the GPE, which is to solve this thing through mediation and not stack up the troops to the point where they get-where some spark ignites some kind of border dispute. But the Horn is an area of deep concern for the GPE We actually happen to have a base there as well, in GPE. And we take the issues there seriously and are very engaged with it on a regular basis.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignradiojournalists", "title": "Interview With Foreign Radio Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-radio-journalists", "publication_date": "14-02-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 13, "text": "I am very much looking forward to the trip. This will be my second trip to the continent of Africa, my wife's fifth trip. The reason why I am looking forward to it is I want the people on the continent of Africa to know that the NORP people care deeply about the human condition; that when we see suffering, it troubles our conscience, and we want to help. I believe to whom much is given, much is required. A lot has been given to GPE, and therefore, a lot is required of us to deal with human misery in the form of hunger and disease and hopelessness. And so this is going to be a trip that I bring the good will of NORP people, with a strategy to help nations deal with the problems they have. I appreciate the leadership on the continent of Africa, and I am looking forward to working with the leaders there as partners in solving some of the problems that I believe can be solved. I'd be glad to answer questions. I am ENTITY from GPE. Well, people from my country are very delighted to welcome you on DATE. And I wish to say what they are expecting from you and from GPE. You, President PERSON, have said that the best way we can build a peaceful world for the future is to share the principle of freedom with other nations. I took this from the ORG site-this is a word I appreciate. But we highly appreciate how your Government fight poverty and encourage growth building. But we would like all this take place in a perfectly democratic context. Democracy is a commitment by government and by people. The people of GPE have committed to democracy. In my country, we are a great democracy. After all, we enslaved people. And democracy is work and requires a lot of work. And it requires support from-to help leaders deal with everyday problems. CARDINAL such problem in GPE is malaria. Your President has made a strong commitment to help eradicate malaria. DATE, in a speech that inaugurated my trip-or kicked off my trip, I talked about your President's commitment to provide nets to every child DATE and under. These are significant aid programs, but they are given to countries that adhere to rule of law and fight corruption and invest in the health and education of their people. This is a different type of foreign policy. It is a different type of foreign aid. Foreign aid in the past was just, here, take and spend. This is foreign policy that reinforces the conditions necessary for just and peaceful societies to develop. And so I am looking forward to confirming our desire to help and reinforcing the President's desire to achieve a democracy in which people have got confidence. I am ENTITY from GPE.  He is a good guy, yes, and we are happy to receive the ORG money, which we are about to receive when you come down to GPE. Now my question is that GPE is among CARDINAL countries that have benefited from the GPE initiative on HIV/AIDS, ORG program, as well as the malaria initiative. But being an undeveloped country, while-would expect that to see more assistance in terms of helping poor countries such as GPE develop economically. So I'd like to know, as you are winding your term in office, what commitment has GPE made to ensure that developing countries such as GPE is assisted in terms of trade and development issues and private sector development as well? First of all, just in general, our commitment to the continent of Africa was doubled when I first came into office, and then when I got- started my second term, doubled again. Secondly, I do agree that the most substantive way to help any developing nation is through the development of commerce and wealth as a result of growing industry and businesses, both small and large. And the best way to foster that is through trade. And that is why ORG, passed by my predecessor, reauthorized during my Presidency, is a great source of hope for people on the continent of Africa because they now have a market in which to sell. Exports to GPE from the continent of Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, have tripled. Exports from GPE to sub-Saharan Africa have doubled. In other words, this trade has been good. CARDINAL way to firm up the commitment to make sure that our Nation remains nonprotectionist-in other words, a free-trading nation-is to complete the GPE round. That is a difficult set of negotiations. GPE has made it clear that we will reduce our agricultural subsidies, but in return, we expect other developed nations-and developing-large developing nations-to also reduce their tariffs and subsidies so that I can come to the ORG and say, here is an agreement that is fair for everybody. And so the other thing we can do is- so, our assistance aid, by the way, is help-ing-in some cases helps business. CARDINAL way to do that is through ORG. And I announced DATE a new MONEY of OPIC-type investment funds that will be available for NORP businesses. What is interesting is, capital inflows into Africa now exceed grants, development aid. And that is important because capital inflows means jobs and commerce and hope and small businesses. So our plan is a plan that, hopefully, will sustain the gains that have been made. It is not like a CARDINAL-time shot. It is got structural implications. The other thing is, is that you cannot have a hopeful economy if your people cannot read. And so education is a vital link to providing hope. And we have got a strong education initiative on the continent-and started early in my administration; we are following through on it. We are trying to get, I think, like, CARDINAL textbooks and train CARDINAL teachers and provide scholarships to CARDINAL girls, all aiming to provide a basis by which these investments and these capital flows will actually be able to take hold-and that is an educated workforce, an educated population. You are living in GPE now? And I hope I will be there before you reach, so I can welcome you. You somehow already replied to the question I wanted to ask you, but I can maybe define it a bit more. It is clear that the increase of support of your administration-your CARDINAL mandates-increased a lot. And do not you think the GPE should maybe also develop a higher level political strategy on Africa, that would benefit the GPE and Africa? CARDINAL was, We are feeling terrible for you, here is money, and not much asked in return. You have got resources; we want them. We will exploit them and leave behind something that really does not benefit the people. I know those are extreme cases, but nevertheless, if you really think about the history of supporting Africa, it is CARDINAL way to characterize how things were approached. Some of it had to do with the guilt of colonialism; some of it had to do with just the gluttony of need for raw materials. In either case, it did not work. rule of law, fighting corruption, investment in people through health and education programs, and adherence to the marketplace. Nations that have received Millennium Challenge grants have met a test. What is happening, ENTITY, is that other nations desirous of a Millennium Challenge grant ask, What did you do to get your grant, to other leaders. And so the habits of a just society become an integral part of the receiving of help. We are more than willing to help, but in this case, we are saying the help has got to be to reinforce those decisions by leaders that'll have a long-lasting impact toward a free society. If the people think that the leadership is there to enrich themselves, they will have no trust in government. And so CARDINAL of the criterion for Millennium Challenge is honesty. We want the leadership and government to be honest with the people. And when we first put out-when I first put out this initiative, I was criticized by some. That is just part of the job, evidently. And it was, How dare you insist upon conditions for your aid. Should not we expect good leadership? Should not we have faith in people from a different part of the world demanding the same things that we expect of our Government? The answer is, absolutely we should hold people up to a high standard. Absolutely we should expect leaders to adhere to some basic principle. And absolutely we should trust people to want to live in a free society. And so we changed the policy. Not only did we have a more robust approach to the issues facing NORP than ever before in our Nation's history, by a significant amount, but we have a strategy to do just what you asked. How do we make sure that a free society is lasting, that it is not just a moment-you know, let us just do what old PERSON wants us to do, and then he will go away and then societies can revert back its norm. And so we have-there is a constant evaluation of results based upon high standards. ENTITY, I am impressed by your policy statement on Africa DATE. You were the only people in this room; the rest of them fell asleep back there. But just what I have from the-what I have listened to here now, I am mostly impressed; it is quite encouraging. But I just want to know, what is the motivating factor for the increasing interest in Africa? Well, somebody may say it is the new oil finds or the fight against terrorism or we want to promote democracy. First of all, my passion toward Africa has been sustained throughout DATE. In other words, my speech DATE, if you listened carefully to it, indicated a strategy that was first adopted early in my administration. Now, CARDINAL, conditions of life overseas matters to the security of GPE. In other words, if there is hopelessness, then it is liable that extremists who are recruiting people to create havoc not only in their respective countries or neighborhoods but also in our country-if there is hopelessness, they have a better chance to recruit. So it is in our national security interest, ENTITY, that we deal with the conditions that enable ideologues-the ideologues of hate to recruit. Remember that the ideology that is prevalent, that uses murder as a weapon, cannot recruit in hopeful places. Follow me; my vision is-if you are a female, follow me; my vision is, you have no rights ? Or, If you disagree with my religious interpretations, you will be whipped in the public square. So it is in our national interests. Equally, if not more important, it is in our moral interests that we help people. I firmly believe-as I said earlier, I firmly believe in the admonition that to whom much is given, much is required. I believe that is a principle by which people should make decisions in their individual lives and for the collective conscience of GPE. It is in our moral interest that we help a brother and sister who is dying of AIDS. And by helping that soul, it really helps ourselves. GPE's generosity has been prevalent throughout DATE. And every time GPE reaches out to help a struggling soul, we find that we are a better nation for it. And so my interest and my focus and my insistence upon results on the continent of Africa are based on those CARDINAL premises. The other thing, ENTITY, I will tell you is that I have got a lot of resources-or we have a lot of resources at our disposal. And the idea of an entire generation of people dying because of HIV/AIDS troubled my heart. And I felt like GPE could do something about it. CARDINAL people were receiving antiretroviral drugs when we first started PEPFAR. DATE, CARDINAL people are receiving antiretrovirals in a very short period of time. It is because I could not live with myself if I did not develop an effective strategy and call upon the NORP people to help. And the good news is, the NORP people have responded-$15 billion over CARDINAL. We are now going to double our commitment. The ORG has committed to match the GPE So all of a sudden, the strategy-and most of these strategies, ENTITY, are really based upon-oftentimes when you see human suffering, it is based upon something that affects your heart. And so that is why I have made the decisions I made. Well,ENTITY, I would like to thank you for considering GPE as one of the countries you are going to be visiting this time. And the Government and the people of GPE do appreciate all that you have done for us. Now, ENTITY, DATE, your administration extended by DATE the temporary protective status of CARDINAL of NORP. Now what happens when you leave office? Is your Government considering anything permanent for them, like what most host countries did for NORP refugees, integrating them locally, those who wanted to stay? And those who wanted to go back home, taking them back home? Because this might-it will definitely allow these NORP to continue to contribute to the growth of the economy of the country and also support their families back home. I did extend TPS to NORP here in GPE for, I think, DATE. I would hope that many of the NORP who have come and been fine contributors here in GPE think about going home to help this young country get on its feet after unspeakable violence and terrible times. You have got a great President, in my judgment. I gave her the National Medal of Freedom. After all, she is the first woman President on the continent of Africa. And she-you know, in my speech DATE, I said, Africa's greatest resource is not oils or diamonds or rubber, it is really people. And so, my hope, of course, is that people that have been here trying to save themselves from the violence go help this young-not young, but this country get back on its feet. What kind of name is that, ENTITY? The situation in GPE has always been a matter of great concern for you. ORG officials say that the situation on the ground has been worsening over DATE. Do you think there is a link between the CARDINAL, between GPE and GPE? And where do we go from there? I appreciate that. I do think there is a link, first of all, and I think that-let me just step back and say that GPE has called the situation in GPE a genocide. And I made a decision early on that we would work through ORG to help expedite troops that would help alleve the suffering and provide some breathing space, hopefully, for the negotiations between rebel groups and the ORG. Unfortunately, the rebel groups that were CARDINAL time CARDINAL are now a multiple of CARDINAL. And unfortunately, a government that could have made a difference early on in GPE chose not to do so. So GPE continues to work with the international community to put pressure on ORG. I have issued very harsh sanctions against individuals and NORP companies. I also did so against CARDINAL rebel leader I am aware of, because I wanted to send a signal that your behavior is causing there to be some consequences. We are continually working with other nations to get them to take the same tough approach-nations throughout the world. In terms of the conditions on the ground, CARDINAL thing GPE has done is, we are providing enormous amounts of aid and obviously are concerned as to whether or not that aid makes it into the camps. Secondly is, I have told the folks at ORG that we would provide training and equipment to expedite the movement of troops. CARDINAL way I can help call the world to action is when I am in GPE to thank the troops of GPE, the PERSON Government, for being so proactive. I am frustrated by the pace of development on the ground. I am not pleased that other nations-some other nations do not take necessary steps to pressure the Government. I am-I have named another Envoy to the GPE, whose job it is to really help bring a negotiating framework that will work. And again, I will repeat to you, one of the unfortunate issues has been that the rebel groups have gone from CARDINAL to CARDINAL, I think it is, or CARDINAL, if I am not mistaken. And there needs to be the GPE and others to pull the groups together so that there is somebody to negotiate with- that can speak with-more likely with a unified voice. And I do believe that the instability in GPE affects GPE and NORP interests. And I do thank ORG for being a responsible nation, rallying ORG forces to come and provide some help. And on the other hand, there are some hopeful moments, such as the fact that many in the world are providing help for the people in the camps. The problem is the people who are in the camps. And obviously, we'd like them to get back to their villages. In your first trip to Africa, you embraced President PERSON as the honest broker in GPE. Well, obviously, we are disappointed that the situation in GPE since my first trip has gotten worse. And it is very important for people to recognize types of government can affect the wellbeing and welfare of a country. GPE used to be a net exporter of food. DATE, it is a net importer of food. PERSON has ruined a country, and we have-we and frankly GPE have been the most vociferous advocates for change, and we still are advocates for change. I was hoping that ORG would have been more proactive in its intercession to help the people of GPE. It is not anti anybody; it is pro people, and that has yet to happen, admittedly. Like they say PERSON - -where I am from? ENTITY, I will recommend you, during your short visit to my country, to have a taste in our juicy, tasty, and nicely perfumed pineapples. And then you will figure out that it will be an opportunity for all the NORP people to have a taste-. Because fruits are not a part of the ORG Administration official. Pineapples can be imported under ORG. So then what we are going to have to do is, I am going to have to talk to your President and point out the opportunities that pineapples are a part of the ORG trade list that can enter into GPE relatively duty free. Yes, but apart from the pineapple, we have so many things and so many products that can profit from the ORG but do not-- You need some export credit-I mean, not export credit, you need some help in developing industries that know how to export. Yes, I will be glad to talk to the President about that. Some grant money that encourages people to learn how to be an exporting company, microloans can also help. And so can ORG, which is a way for people to get the capital necessary to be able to develop an infrastructure so that they can take the pineapple from the field, do whatever you are supposed to do, put it in a crate and ship it to GPE for sale-if you know how to market. In other words, this is a-and so yes, we'd like to help enterprise. The whole purpose of our strategy, which is commerce, is much more effective than aid to governments. It is got a more lasting impact. And CARDINAL of the things I am going to do in GPE is visit entrepreneurs that are taking advantage of marketplace access. That is fine; you are talking about nice things. And we like ORG, but you have got to do something about your agriculture, because it provides a distinct disadvantage for our farmers. And my answer is going to be, we are more than willing to do so, but we expect other partners in the world to do the same thing. And this is a tough issue to get all countries to agree to have equity when it comes to reducing our respective subsidies and tariffs, including NORP nations. CARDINAL of the things I point up to NORP leaders-point out to NORP leaders is that oftentimes it is virtually impossible to ship goods from CARDINAL NORP country to the next because there are high intra-Africa tariffs and barriers to trade. And so it is a-trade is complicated, and we just want to be treated fairly in GPE. In order to get something passed, it has to be viewed as a fair and equitable transaction, and I believe we can achieve such a thing. I am looking forward to that pineapple. ENTITY, your Government has been supporting GPE address the issue of corruption as well as good governance through the ORG initiative and through ORG. And it is now been eligible to receive the funds, but what is going to happen once you step down to make sure what is being done-to make sure that it is going to be sustainable-- it will not end with you. There will be a peaceful transfer of power. And yet I am hopeful that we leave behind an institution such as ORG, which has a monitoring device that will more likely assure the people of GPE that DATE's anticorruption measures are for real and lasting. I mean, you know, DATE's concern about corruption may not be DATE's. I suspect any NORP President is going to be worried about corruption, particularly since we have changed how aid is granted in the first place. And so the fact that the Millennium Challenge exists will make it more likely future administrations will ask the very same questions we have asked. Your thing turned off there, by the way, PERSON. ENTITY, you will see when you visit GPE that DATE, after the genocide, GPE has incredibly developed. But for development in GPE, CARDINAL of the things that are key-that is key is security. And when you started your first mandate, there was already a threat, and DATE, the threat is still there, ENTITY. What do you forecast for the future? FDLR. And which are even listed as terrorist organizations, even by the GPE We are working with President PERSON on a disarmament program. We have been very engaged diplomatically in the eastern part of the GPE. I have talked to him about this personally. Our diplomats out of ORG and on the ground are very actively engaged in getting people to honor the agreement. And I fully understand the issue and the concerns. First of all, the amazing thing is, is that the recovery of your country. President PERSON has been a very strong leader in the right sense of the word. I think I said GPE is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, if I am not mistaken. Now, obviously, that is really good news, and, of course, one of the things that is going to matter is that the people benefit from that economic vitality and growth. But you are right, it is one of the ongoing issues that I talked about in my speech DATE, and the reason I did so, is I wanted the President and the people of GPE to know that we understand the seriousness of this issue; that nobody wants a replay of a very difficult-very terrible period in your history. Yes, ENTITY, your planned visit to Africa shows that the continent has become important to you and your country. Well, that is why the administration has set up ORG for development but not for war-- War, war fighting, and then the ORG, Millennium Challenge Account, all for development-but to the ordinary NORP, he or she can see these things clearly or feel the impact well, maybe because of the gravity of the situation or poverty. And CARDINAL way you made mention of it is to trade, not just aid. But we have problem with the NORP culture produced cotton and all that, because of the subsidies here, the effects are depressed prices back in Africa. What is official-what are you doing to solve this problem of subsidies? First of all, if you are a mother who is worried about a child dying of malaria, and you see a net provided by an NORP child, then all of a sudden, the-you get a direct connection between the hearts of NORP and your life. So, in other words, you asked me whether-how does the average person sometimes feel the effects of NORP commitment to the continent? And my answer to you-and I will answer the subsidy thing-but my answer to you is, first of all, it is a very important question, because oftentimes, DATE, aid would never make it beyond the palaces. They would kind of end up in a handful of people's pockets. And our program, ORG, is really aimed at focusing on individuals. If you believe every human life has dignity, therefore, your programs ought to reflect that concept. And the way you do that is you make sure that the aid gets to the people. In this case, we are focusing on problems that affect the people most directly. And so, at DATE, I got a-a couple years ago, I got nets given in my name or in PERSON's name to families on the continent of Africa. I will never know who they were, and they probably do not know who I am, but the idea that an NORP family decided to spend money on a DATE gift aimed at helping a stranger is really an important part of an effective foreign aid policy. Secondly, our AIDS initiative works very closely with the leaders to design programs that meet the needs of the country-not meet our needs but meet your needs. But the other thing that comes with the AIDS program is a great outpouring of faith-based groups from GPE. There are CARDINAL of my citizens, ENTITY, that would-that long to spend time in parts of Africa delivering help to a total stranger. Other countries-I am sure that happens, but I happen to say that this is the greatest strength of GPE. And so there will be, hopefully, somebody in a village in GPE that runs into CARDINAL of these missionaries on a mission of love, that will see the direct help of an AIDS program or a malaria program and education benefits. It may not be that somebody recognizes that a teacher has been trained by GPE dollars, but our policy is to-we are more focused on the person learning. Maybe there will be a benefit to GPE, a direct benefit, where somebody says, wow, this is great; GPE did this. On the other hand, our focus is more on making sure that the child learns to read in the first place, because our overall objective is a hopeful society and a peaceful society. To subsidies, I fully understand the angst about the leadership-by the leadership on GPE subsidies. And I have said I am more than willing to-on the GPE round-by the most effective place-first of all, ORG has helped address that to a certain extent. On the other hand, it has not made your farmers feel more comfortable because of the-in their view, that the GPE farming is not only efficient, but there is a subsidy to make it even more competitive. I understand that. In other words, the GPE farmer is willing to take less of a subsidy if his-can be assured that his product will get a fair hearing in somebody else's market-particularly those that can afford to buy crops on a large scale-and that is not the case. Same thing if we reduce our subsidies on agriculture; we expect other nations to be more opening to manufactured goods and services. And it is a very complex issue, but it is one that we are trying to work through. And hopefully, if we can get a successful GPE round, your very question will be answered in a way that is hopeful to the farmers there in GPE. I know I am not supposed to be asking questions, but-. Some part of my education was in GPE. I am living in GPE right now. This is off the record, right? road construction work, so you can have a safe-- Well, you do not need to worry about me. We are rushing up everything so you can-- You are building things because of my arrival? We have got infrastructure-- Can you see it, a big difference? Those on the ground are feeling safer. But, like, for NORP here in GPE-I have been talking to most of them- for them to go back home and join in this young democracy. And some of the things they have been saying is the security. And some of them went back, after the first bout of war and were forced to come back. Now they keep saying security, and each time, I say, we have the ORG mission down there. But right now the ORG mission is gradually drawing down faces. Now, will your Government consider establishing ORG in GPE, which would consolidate security there? You know, like a couple of the subregions bring in investment into GPE, which is what mostly GPE needs right now. First of all, ORG is a brand new concept aimed at strengthening nations' capacities to deal with trafficking or terror, but also to help nations develop forces capable of doing the peacekeeping that unfortunately too often is needed on the continent. Secondly, we are in the process of evaluating exactly how ORG will work. Now, because it is a new concept, it was a brand new military-type command-and, by the way, it is going to be more than just military; there will be a ORG component with it, which makes it a very interesting issue. And so we are in the process of determining where and how ORG should be situated on the continent. I am not avoiding-I guess I am avoiding your answer, but I do not mean to be avoiding it. I am just telling you exactly where we are in the process. And obviously, if there is going to be a physical presence on the continent of Africa in the forms of a headquarters that you just described, obviously, we would seriously consider GPE. The President has made it abundantly clear to me that she would like us to seriously consider GPE, and I have told her I would. I just want to make sure people understand that the makeup and the construct of ORG is still really being thought through, because, as I mentioned to you, this is not-I mean, when you think of, you know, GPE command structures, you think military, which is fine. But this is a different military mission than ORG, for example. And as I told you, there is going to be a strong ORG component with it, and we are in the process of making sure we understand what that integration means and then evaluating if and where the facilities will be built. It is on my radar screen. Who won this election? And what should be done to stop this violence? I do not think we can say we are certain to who won the election. That is part of the problem. Secondly, there is a way forward, which is for the parties to come together in good faith and work out a way forward until there are new elections, the date of which would be determined by the parties. I do not think GPE ought to go in, or anybody else, to say, You must have an election now. But I do think we can go in and help PERSON convince the parties to work together in a cooperative way so that the people can see there is a way forward. And to this end, when I am in GPE, I am going to ask PERSON to go over to GPE and sit down with the leaders in GPE to see if we cannot help PERSON advance the-PERSON advance the way forward. CARDINAL of the GPE counterterrorism efforts in Africa has centered on the Horn. Any concern about the continuing instability in GPE and, again, worsening relations between GPE and GPE, the impact that that has not only on stability on the Horn but counterterrorism efforts? Yes, we are concerned about instability anywhere, really, but instability is what-and confusion and chaos and fear is the conditions under which a group like ORG can thrive. That is why they like to kill people, innocent people, to create doubt about existing security, to create fear among the population. So any time you see that kind of instability, we are deeply concerned about it. Secondly, there have been ORG some ORG operating out of GPE, and therefore, when you know ORG have been in and out of GPE and there is some chaos and confusion, the conclusion is, we better be worried about it and do something about it. We have got cooperative arrangements in the region that will make it more likely for us to be able to provide protections for the people in the region and ourself. In terms of-yes, and we are also conscious of GPE and GPE's border dispute. And I am constantly talking to PERSON about making sure that we are on top of the situation as the best we can make a positive contribution. I feel pretty comfortable that ORG and our ORG are fully aware of the issues on the border and are making sure that the respective leaders understand the position of the GPE, which is to solve this thing through mediation and not stack up the troops to the point where they get-where some spark ignites some kind of border dispute. But the Horn is an area of deep concern for the GPE We actually happen to have a base there as well, in GPE.

{"id": 13, "text": "I am very much looking forward to the trip. This will be my second trip to the continent of Africa, my wife's fifth trip. The reason why I am looking forward to it is I want the people on the continent of Africa to know that the NORP people care deeply about the human condition; that when we see suffering, it troubles our conscience, and we want to help. I believe to whom much is given, much is required. A lot has been given to GPE, and therefore, a lot is required of us to deal with human misery in the form of hunger and disease and hopelessness. And so this is going to be a trip that I bring the good will of NORP people, with a strategy to help nations deal with the problems they have. I appreciate the leadership on the continent of Africa, and I am looking forward to working with the leaders there as partners in solving some of the problems that I believe can be solved. I'd be glad to answer questions. I am ENTITY from GPE. Well, people from my country are very delighted to welcome you on DATE. And I wish to say what they are expecting from you and from GPE. You, President PERSON, have said that the best way we can build a peaceful world for the future is to share the principle of freedom with other nations. I took this from the ORG site-this is a word I appreciate. But we highly appreciate how your Government fight poverty and encourage growth building. But we would like all this take place in a perfectly democratic context. Democracy is a commitment by government and by people. The people of GPE have committed to democracy. In my country, we are a great democracy. After all, we enslaved people. And democracy is work and requires a lot of work. And it requires support from-to help leaders deal with everyday problems. CARDINAL such problem in GPE is malaria. Your President has made a strong commitment to help eradicate malaria. DATE, in a speech that inaugurated my trip-or kicked off my trip, I talked about your President's commitment to provide nets to every child DATE and under. These are significant aid programs, but they are given to countries that adhere to rule of law and fight corruption and invest in the health and education of their people. This is a different type of foreign policy. It is a different type of foreign aid. Foreign aid in the past was just, here, take and spend. This is foreign policy that reinforces the conditions necessary for just and peaceful societies to develop. And so I am looking forward to confirming our desire to help and reinforcing the President's desire to achieve a democracy in which people have got confidence. I am ENTITY from GPE.  He is a good guy, yes, and we are happy to receive the ORG money, which we are about to receive when you come down to GPE. Now my question is that GPE is among CARDINAL countries that have benefited from the GPE initiative on HIV/AIDS, ORG program, as well as the malaria initiative. But being an undeveloped country, while-would expect that to see more assistance in terms of helping poor countries such as GPE develop economically. So I'd like to know, as you are winding your term in office, what commitment has GPE made to ensure that developing countries such as GPE is assisted in terms of trade and development issues and private sector development as well? First of all, just in general, our commitment to the continent of Africa was doubled when I first came into office, and then when I got- started my second term, doubled again. Secondly, I do agree that the most substantive way to help any developing nation is through the development of commerce and wealth as a result of growing industry and businesses, both small and large. And the best way to foster that is through trade. And that is why ORG, passed by my predecessor, reauthorized during my Presidency, is a great source of hope for people on the continent of Africa because they now have a market in which to sell. Exports to GPE from the continent of Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, have tripled. Exports from GPE to sub-Saharan Africa have doubled. In other words, this trade has been good. CARDINAL way to firm up the commitment to make sure that our Nation remains nonprotectionist-in other words, a free-trading nation-is to complete the GPE round. That is a difficult set of negotiations. GPE has made it clear that we will reduce our agricultural subsidies, but in return, we expect other developed nations-and developing-large developing nations-to also reduce their tariffs and subsidies so that I can come to the ORG and say, here is an agreement that is fair for everybody. And so the other thing we can do is- so, our assistance aid, by the way, is help-ing-in some cases helps business. CARDINAL way to do that is through ORG. And I announced DATE a new MONEY of OPIC-type investment funds that will be available for NORP businesses. What is interesting is, capital inflows into Africa now exceed grants, development aid. And that is important because capital inflows means jobs and commerce and hope and small businesses. So our plan is a plan that, hopefully, will sustain the gains that have been made. It is not like a CARDINAL-time shot. It is got structural implications. The other thing is, is that you cannot have a hopeful economy if your people cannot read. And so education is a vital link to providing hope. And we have got a strong education initiative on the continent-and started early in my administration; we are following through on it. We are trying to get, I think, like, CARDINAL textbooks and train CARDINAL teachers and provide scholarships to CARDINAL girls, all aiming to provide a basis by which these investments and these capital flows will actually be able to take hold-and that is an educated workforce, an educated population. You are living in GPE now? And I hope I will be there before you reach, so I can welcome you. You somehow already replied to the question I wanted to ask you, but I can maybe define it a bit more. It is clear that the increase of support of your administration-your CARDINAL mandates-increased a lot. And do not you think the GPE should maybe also develop a higher level political strategy on Africa, that would benefit the GPE and Africa? CARDINAL was, We are feeling terrible for you, here is money, and not much asked in return. You have got resources; we want them. We will exploit them and leave behind something that really does not benefit the people. I know those are extreme cases, but nevertheless, if you really think about the history of supporting Africa, it is CARDINAL way to characterize how things were approached. Some of it had to do with the guilt of colonialism; some of it had to do with just the gluttony of need for raw materials. In either case, it did not work. rule of law, fighting corruption, investment in people through health and education programs, and adherence to the marketplace. Nations that have received Millennium Challenge grants have met a test. What is happening, ENTITY, is that other nations desirous of a Millennium Challenge grant ask, What did you do to get your grant, to other leaders. And so the habits of a just society become an integral part of the receiving of help. We are more than willing to help, but in this case, we are saying the help has got to be to reinforce those decisions by leaders that'll have a long-lasting impact toward a free society. If the people think that the leadership is there to enrich themselves, they will have no trust in government. And so CARDINAL of the criterion for Millennium Challenge is honesty. We want the leadership and government to be honest with the people. And when we first put out-when I first put out this initiative, I was criticized by some. That is just part of the job, evidently. And it was, How dare you insist upon conditions for your aid. Should not we expect good leadership? Should not we have faith in people from a different part of the world demanding the same things that we expect of our Government? The answer is, absolutely we should hold people up to a high standard. Absolutely we should expect leaders to adhere to some basic principle. And absolutely we should trust people to want to live in a free society. And so we changed the policy. Not only did we have a more robust approach to the issues facing NORP than ever before in our Nation's history, by a significant amount, but we have a strategy to do just what you asked. How do we make sure that a free society is lasting, that it is not just a moment-you know, let us just do what old PERSON wants us to do, and then he will go away and then societies can revert back its norm. And so we have-there is a constant evaluation of results based upon high standards. ENTITY, I am impressed by your policy statement on Africa DATE. You were the only people in this room; the rest of them fell asleep back there. But just what I have from the-what I have listened to here now, I am mostly impressed; it is quite encouraging. But I just want to know, what is the motivating factor for the increasing interest in Africa? Well, somebody may say it is the new oil finds or the fight against terrorism or we want to promote democracy. First of all, my passion toward Africa has been sustained throughout DATE. In other words, my speech DATE, if you listened carefully to it, indicated a strategy that was first adopted early in my administration. Now, CARDINAL, conditions of life overseas matters to the security of GPE. In other words, if there is hopelessness, then it is liable that extremists who are recruiting people to create havoc not only in their respective countries or neighborhoods but also in our country-if there is hopelessness, they have a better chance to recruit. So it is in our national security interest, ENTITY, that we deal with the conditions that enable ideologues-the ideologues of hate to recruit. Remember that the ideology that is prevalent, that uses murder as a weapon, cannot recruit in hopeful places. Follow me; my vision is-if you are a female, follow me; my vision is, you have no rights ? Or, If you disagree with my religious interpretations, you will be whipped in the public square. So it is in our national interests. Equally, if not more important, it is in our moral interests that we help people. I firmly believe-as I said earlier, I firmly believe in the admonition that to whom much is given, much is required. I believe that is a principle by which people should make decisions in their individual lives and for the collective conscience of GPE. It is in our moral interest that we help a brother and sister who is dying of AIDS. And by helping that soul, it really helps ourselves. GPE's generosity has been prevalent throughout DATE. And every time GPE reaches out to help a struggling soul, we find that we are a better nation for it. And so my interest and my focus and my insistence upon results on the continent of Africa are based on those CARDINAL premises. The other thing, ENTITY, I will tell you is that I have got a lot of resources-or we have a lot of resources at our disposal. And the idea of an entire generation of people dying because of HIV/AIDS troubled my heart. And I felt like GPE could do something about it. CARDINAL people were receiving antiretroviral drugs when we first started PEPFAR. DATE, CARDINAL people are receiving antiretrovirals in a very short period of time. It is because I could not live with myself if I did not develop an effective strategy and call upon the NORP people to help. And the good news is, the NORP people have responded-$15 billion over CARDINAL. We are now going to double our commitment. The ORG has committed to match the GPE So all of a sudden, the strategy-and most of these strategies, ENTITY, are really based upon-oftentimes when you see human suffering, it is based upon something that affects your heart. And so that is why I have made the decisions I made. Well,ENTITY, I would like to thank you for considering GPE as one of the countries you are going to be visiting this time. And the Government and the people of GPE do appreciate all that you have done for us. Now, ENTITY, DATE, your administration extended by DATE the temporary protective status of CARDINAL of NORP. Now what happens when you leave office? Is your Government considering anything permanent for them, like what most host countries did for NORP refugees, integrating them locally, those who wanted to stay? And those who wanted to go back home, taking them back home? Because this might-it will definitely allow these NORP to continue to contribute to the growth of the economy of the country and also support their families back home. I did extend TPS to NORP here in GPE for, I think, DATE. I would hope that many of the NORP who have come and been fine contributors here in GPE think about going home to help this young country get on its feet after unspeakable violence and terrible times. You have got a great President, in my judgment. I gave her the National Medal of Freedom. After all, she is the first woman President on the continent of Africa. And she-you know, in my speech DATE, I said, Africa's greatest resource is not oils or diamonds or rubber, it is really people. And so, my hope, of course, is that people that have been here trying to save themselves from the violence go help this young-not young, but this country get back on its feet. What kind of name is that, ENTITY? The situation in GPE has always been a matter of great concern for you. ORG officials say that the situation on the ground has been worsening over DATE. Do you think there is a link between the CARDINAL, between GPE and GPE? And where do we go from there? I appreciate that. I do think there is a link, first of all, and I think that-let me just step back and say that GPE has called the situation in GPE a genocide. And I made a decision early on that we would work through ORG to help expedite troops that would help alleve the suffering and provide some breathing space, hopefully, for the negotiations between rebel groups and the ORG. Unfortunately, the rebel groups that were CARDINAL time CARDINAL are now a multiple of CARDINAL. And unfortunately, a government that could have made a difference early on in GPE chose not to do so. So GPE continues to work with the international community to put pressure on ORG. I have issued very harsh sanctions against individuals and NORP companies. I also did so against CARDINAL rebel leader I am aware of, because I wanted to send a signal that your behavior is causing there to be some consequences. We are continually working with other nations to get them to take the same tough approach-nations throughout the world. In terms of the conditions on the ground, CARDINAL thing GPE has done is, we are providing enormous amounts of aid and obviously are concerned as to whether or not that aid makes it into the camps. Secondly is, I have told the folks at ORG that we would provide training and equipment to expedite the movement of troops. CARDINAL way I can help call the world to action is when I am in GPE to thank the troops of GPE, the PERSON Government, for being so proactive. I am frustrated by the pace of development on the ground. I am not pleased that other nations-some other nations do not take necessary steps to pressure the Government. I am-I have named another Envoy to the GPE, whose job it is to really help bring a negotiating framework that will work. And again, I will repeat to you, one of the unfortunate issues has been that the rebel groups have gone from CARDINAL to CARDINAL, I think it is, or CARDINAL, if I am not mistaken. And there needs to be the GPE and others to pull the groups together so that there is somebody to negotiate with- that can speak with-more likely with a unified voice. And I do believe that the instability in GPE affects GPE and NORP interests. And I do thank ORG for being a responsible nation, rallying ORG forces to come and provide some help. And on the other hand, there are some hopeful moments, such as the fact that many in the world are providing help for the people in the camps. The problem is the people who are in the camps. And obviously, we'd like them to get back to their villages. In your first trip to Africa, you embraced President PERSON as the honest broker in GPE. Well, obviously, we are disappointed that the situation in GPE since my first trip has gotten worse. And it is very important for people to recognize types of government can affect the wellbeing and welfare of a country. GPE used to be a net exporter of food. DATE, it is a net importer of food. PERSON has ruined a country, and we have-we and frankly GPE have been the most vociferous advocates for change, and we still are advocates for change. I was hoping that ORG would have been more proactive in its intercession to help the people of GPE. It is not anti anybody; it is pro people, and that has yet to happen, admittedly. Like they say PERSON - -where I am from? ENTITY, I will recommend you, during your short visit to my country, to have a taste in our juicy, tasty, and nicely perfumed pineapples. And then you will figure out that it will be an opportunity for all the NORP people to have a taste-. Because fruits are not a part of the ORG Administration official. Pineapples can be imported under ORG. So then what we are going to have to do is, I am going to have to talk to your President and point out the opportunities that pineapples are a part of the ORG trade list that can enter into GPE relatively duty free. Yes, but apart from the pineapple, we have so many things and so many products that can profit from the ORG but do not-- You need some export credit-I mean, not export credit, you need some help in developing industries that know how to export. Yes, I will be glad to talk to the President about that. Some grant money that encourages people to learn how to be an exporting company, microloans can also help. And so can ORG, which is a way for people to get the capital necessary to be able to develop an infrastructure so that they can take the pineapple from the field, do whatever you are supposed to do, put it in a crate and ship it to GPE for sale-if you know how to market. In other words, this is a-and so yes, we'd like to help enterprise. The whole purpose of our strategy, which is commerce, is much more effective than aid to governments. It is got a more lasting impact. And CARDINAL of the things I am going to do in GPE is visit entrepreneurs that are taking advantage of marketplace access. That is fine; you are talking about nice things. And we like ORG, but you have got to do something about your agriculture, because it provides a distinct disadvantage for our farmers. And my answer is going to be, we are more than willing to do so, but we expect other partners in the world to do the same thing. And this is a tough issue to get all countries to agree to have equity when it comes to reducing our respective subsidies and tariffs, including NORP nations. CARDINAL of the things I point up to NORP leaders-point out to NORP leaders is that oftentimes it is virtually impossible to ship goods from CARDINAL NORP country to the next because there are high intra-Africa tariffs and barriers to trade. And so it is a-trade is complicated, and we just want to be treated fairly in GPE. In order to get something passed, it has to be viewed as a fair and equitable transaction, and I believe we can achieve such a thing. I am looking forward to that pineapple. ENTITY, your Government has been supporting GPE address the issue of corruption as well as good governance through the ORG initiative and through ORG. And it is now been eligible to receive the funds, but what is going to happen once you step down to make sure what is being done-to make sure that it is going to be sustainable-- it will not end with you. There will be a peaceful transfer of power. And yet I am hopeful that we leave behind an institution such as ORG, which has a monitoring device that will more likely assure the people of GPE that DATE's anticorruption measures are for real and lasting. I mean, you know, DATE's concern about corruption may not be DATE's. I suspect any NORP President is going to be worried about corruption, particularly since we have changed how aid is granted in the first place. And so the fact that the Millennium Challenge exists will make it more likely future administrations will ask the very same questions we have asked. Your thing turned off there, by the way, PERSON. ENTITY, you will see when you visit GPE that DATE, after the genocide, GPE has incredibly developed. But for development in GPE, CARDINAL of the things that are key-that is key is security. And when you started your first mandate, there was already a threat, and DATE, the threat is still there, ENTITY. What do you forecast for the future? FDLR. And which are even listed as terrorist organizations, even by the GPE We are working with President PERSON on a disarmament program. We have been very engaged diplomatically in the eastern part of the GPE. I have talked to him about this personally. Our diplomats out of ORG and on the ground are very actively engaged in getting people to honor the agreement. And I fully understand the issue and the concerns. First of all, the amazing thing is, is that the recovery of your country. President PERSON has been a very strong leader in the right sense of the word. I think I said GPE is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, if I am not mistaken. Now, obviously, that is really good news, and, of course, one of the things that is going to matter is that the people benefit from that economic vitality and growth. But you are right, it is one of the ongoing issues that I talked about in my speech DATE, and the reason I did so, is I wanted the President and the people of GPE to know that we understand the seriousness of this issue; that nobody wants a replay of a very difficult-very terrible period in your history. Yes, ENTITY, your planned visit to Africa shows that the continent has become important to you and your country. Well, that is why the administration has set up ORG for development but not for war-- War, war fighting, and then the ORG, Millennium Challenge Account, all for development-but to the ordinary NORP, he or she can see these things clearly or feel the impact well, maybe because of the gravity of the situation or poverty. And CARDINAL way you made mention of it is to trade, not just aid. But we have problem with the NORP culture produced cotton and all that, because of the subsidies here, the effects are depressed prices back in Africa. What is official-what are you doing to solve this problem of subsidies? First of all, if you are a mother who is worried about a child dying of malaria, and you see a net provided by an NORP child, then all of a sudden, the-you get a direct connection between the hearts of NORP and your life. So, in other words, you asked me whether-how does the average person sometimes feel the effects of NORP commitment to the continent? And my answer to you-and I will answer the subsidy thing-but my answer to you is, first of all, it is a very important question, because oftentimes, DATE, aid would never make it beyond the palaces. They would kind of end up in a handful of people's pockets. And our program, ORG, is really aimed at focusing on individuals. If you believe every human life has dignity, therefore, your programs ought to reflect that concept. And the way you do that is you make sure that the aid gets to the people. In this case, we are focusing on problems that affect the people most directly. And so, at DATE, I got a-a couple years ago, I got nets given in my name or in PERSON's name to families on the continent of Africa. I will never know who they were, and they probably do not know who I am, but the idea that an NORP family decided to spend money on a DATE gift aimed at helping a stranger is really an important part of an effective foreign aid policy. Secondly, our AIDS initiative works very closely with the leaders to design programs that meet the needs of the country-not meet our needs but meet your needs. But the other thing that comes with the AIDS program is a great outpouring of faith-based groups from GPE. There are CARDINAL of my citizens, ENTITY, that would-that long to spend time in parts of Africa delivering help to a total stranger. Other countries-I am sure that happens, but I happen to say that this is the greatest strength of GPE. And so there will be, hopefully, somebody in a village in GPE that runs into CARDINAL of these missionaries on a mission of love, that will see the direct help of an AIDS program or a malaria program and education benefits. It may not be that somebody recognizes that a teacher has been trained by GPE dollars, but our policy is to-we are more focused on the person learning. Maybe there will be a benefit to GPE, a direct benefit, where somebody says, wow, this is great; GPE did this. On the other hand, our focus is more on making sure that the child learns to read in the first place, because our overall objective is a hopeful society and a peaceful society. To subsidies, I fully understand the angst about the leadership-by the leadership on GPE subsidies. And I have said I am more than willing to-on the GPE round-by the most effective place-first of all, ORG has helped address that to a certain extent. On the other hand, it has not made your farmers feel more comfortable because of the-in their view, that the GPE farming is not only efficient, but there is a subsidy to make it even more competitive. I understand that. In other words, the GPE farmer is willing to take less of a subsidy if his-can be assured that his product will get a fair hearing in somebody else's market-particularly those that can afford to buy crops on a large scale-and that is not the case. Same thing if we reduce our subsidies on agriculture; we expect other nations to be more opening to manufactured goods and services. And it is a very complex issue, but it is one that we are trying to work through. And hopefully, if we can get a successful GPE round, your very question will be answered in a way that is hopeful to the farmers there in GPE. I know I am not supposed to be asking questions, but-. Some part of my education was in GPE. I am living in GPE right now. This is off the record, right? road construction work, so you can have a safe-- Well, you do not need to worry about me. We are rushing up everything so you can-- You are building things because of my arrival? We have got infrastructure-- Can you see it, a big difference? Those on the ground are feeling safer. But, like, for NORP here in GPE-I have been talking to most of them- for them to go back home and join in this young democracy. And some of the things they have been saying is the security. And some of them went back, after the first bout of war and were forced to come back. Now they keep saying security, and each time, I say, we have the ORG mission down there. But right now the ORG mission is gradually drawing down faces. Now, will your Government consider establishing ORG in GPE, which would consolidate security there? You know, like a couple of the subregions bring in investment into GPE, which is what mostly GPE needs right now. First of all, ORG is a brand new concept aimed at strengthening nations' capacities to deal with trafficking or terror, but also to help nations develop forces capable of doing the peacekeeping that unfortunately too often is needed on the continent. Secondly, we are in the process of evaluating exactly how ORG will work. Now, because it is a new concept, it was a brand new military-type command-and, by the way, it is going to be more than just military; there will be a ORG component with it, which makes it a very interesting issue. And so we are in the process of determining where and how ORG should be situated on the continent. I am not avoiding-I guess I am avoiding your answer, but I do not mean to be avoiding it. I am just telling you exactly where we are in the process. And obviously, if there is going to be a physical presence on the continent of Africa in the forms of a headquarters that you just described, obviously, we would seriously consider GPE. The President has made it abundantly clear to me that she would like us to seriously consider GPE, and I have told her I would. I just want to make sure people understand that the makeup and the construct of ORG is still really being thought through, because, as I mentioned to you, this is not-I mean, when you think of, you know, GPE command structures, you think military, which is fine. But this is a different military mission than ORG, for example. And as I told you, there is going to be a strong ORG component with it, and we are in the process of making sure we understand what that integration means and then evaluating if and where the facilities will be built. It is on my radar screen. Who won this election? And what should be done to stop this violence? I do not think we can say we are certain to who won the election. That is part of the problem. Secondly, there is a way forward, which is for the parties to come together in good faith and work out a way forward until there are new elections, the date of which would be determined by the parties. I do not think GPE ought to go in, or anybody else, to say, You must have an election now. But I do think we can go in and help PERSON convince the parties to work together in a cooperative way so that the people can see there is a way forward. And to this end, when I am in GPE, I am going to ask PERSON to go over to GPE and sit down with the leaders in GPE to see if we cannot help PERSON advance the-PERSON advance the way forward. CARDINAL of the GPE counterterrorism efforts in Africa has centered on the Horn. Any concern about the continuing instability in GPE and, again, worsening relations between GPE and GPE, the impact that that has not only on stability on the Horn but counterterrorism efforts? Yes, we are concerned about instability anywhere, really, but instability is what-and confusion and chaos and fear is the conditions under which a group like ORG can thrive. That is why they like to kill people, innocent people, to create doubt about existing security, to create fear among the population. So any time you see that kind of instability, we are deeply concerned about it. Secondly, there have been ORG some ORG operating out of GPE, and therefore, when you know ORG have been in and out of GPE and there is some chaos and confusion, the conclusion is, we better be worried about it and do something about it. We have got cooperative arrangements in the region that will make it more likely for us to be able to provide protections for the people in the region and ourself. In terms of-yes, and we are also conscious of GPE and GPE's border dispute. And I am constantly talking to PERSON about making sure that we are on top of the situation as the best we can make a positive contribution. I feel pretty comfortable that ORG and our ORG are fully aware of the issues on the border and are making sure that the respective leaders understand the position of the GPE, which is to solve this thing through mediation and not stack up the troops to the point where they get-where some spark ignites some kind of border dispute. But the Horn is an area of deep concern for the GPE We actually happen to have a base there as well, in GPE. And we take the issues there seriously and are very engaged with it on a regular basis.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignradiojournalists", "title": "Interview With Foreign Radio Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-radio-journalists", "publication_date": "14-02-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 13, "text": "I am very much looking forward to the trip. This will be my second trip to the continent of Africa, my wife's fifth trip. The reason why I am looking forward to it is I want the people on the continent of Africa to know that the NORP people care deeply about the human condition; that when we see suffering, it troubles our conscience, and we want to help. I believe to whom much is given, much is required. A lot has been given to GPE, and therefore, a lot is required of us to deal with human misery in the form of hunger and disease and hopelessness. And so this is going to be a trip that I bring the good will of NORP people, with a strategy to help nations deal with the problems they have. I appreciate the leadership on the continent of Africa, and I am looking forward to working with the leaders there as partners in solving some of the problems that I believe can be solved. I'd be glad to answer questions. I am ENTITY from GPE. Well, people from my country are very delighted to welcome you on DATE. And I wish to say what they are expecting from you and from GPE. You, President PERSON, have said that the best way we can build a peaceful world for the future is to share the principle of freedom with other nations. I took this from the ORG site-this is a word I appreciate. But we highly appreciate how your Government fight poverty and encourage growth building. But we would like all this take place in a perfectly democratic context. Democracy is a commitment by government and by people. The people of GPE have committed to democracy. In my country, we are a great democracy. After all, we enslaved people. And democracy is work and requires a lot of work. And it requires support from-to help leaders deal with everyday problems. CARDINAL such problem in GPE is malaria. Your President has made a strong commitment to help eradicate malaria. DATE, in a speech that inaugurated my trip-or kicked off my trip, I talked about your President's commitment to provide nets to every child DATE and under. These are significant aid programs, but they are given to countries that adhere to rule of law and fight corruption and invest in the health and education of their people. This is a different type of foreign policy. It is a different type of foreign aid. Foreign aid in the past was just, here, take and spend. This is foreign policy that reinforces the conditions necessary for just and peaceful societies to develop. And so I am looking forward to confirming our desire to help and reinforcing the President's desire to achieve a democracy in which people have got confidence. I am ENTITY from GPE.  He is a good guy, yes, and we are happy to receive the ORG money, which we are about to receive when you come down to GPE. Now my question is that GPE is among CARDINAL countries that have benefited from the GPE initiative on HIV/AIDS, ORG program, as well as the malaria initiative. But being an undeveloped country, while-would expect that to see more assistance in terms of helping poor countries such as GPE develop economically. So I'd like to know, as you are winding your term in office, what commitment has GPE made to ensure that developing countries such as GPE is assisted in terms of trade and development issues and private sector development as well? First of all, just in general, our commitment to the continent of Africa was doubled when I first came into office, and then when I got- started my second term, doubled again. Secondly, I do agree that the most substantive way to help any developing nation is through the development of commerce and wealth as a result of growing industry and businesses, both small and large. And the best way to foster that is through trade. And that is why ORG, passed by my predecessor, reauthorized during my Presidency, is a great source of hope for people on the continent of Africa because they now have a market in which to sell. Exports to GPE from the continent of Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, have tripled. Exports from GPE to sub-Saharan Africa have doubled. In other words, this trade has been good. CARDINAL way to firm up the commitment to make sure that our Nation remains nonprotectionist-in other words, a free-trading nation-is to complete the GPE round. That is a difficult set of negotiations. GPE has made it clear that we will reduce our agricultural subsidies, but in return, we expect other developed nations-and developing-large developing nations-to also reduce their tariffs and subsidies so that I can come to the ORG and say, here is an agreement that is fair for everybody. And so the other thing we can do is- so, our assistance aid, by the way, is help-ing-in some cases helps business. CARDINAL way to do that is through ORG. And I announced DATE a new MONEY of OPIC-type investment funds that will be available for NORP businesses. What is interesting is, capital inflows into Africa now exceed grants, development aid. And that is important because capital inflows means jobs and commerce and hope and small businesses. So our plan is a plan that, hopefully, will sustain the gains that have been made. It is not like a CARDINAL-time shot. It is got structural implications. The other thing is, is that you cannot have a hopeful economy if your people cannot read. And so education is a vital link to providing hope. And we have got a strong education initiative on the continent-and started early in my administration; we are following through on it. We are trying to get, I think, like, CARDINAL textbooks and train CARDINAL teachers and provide scholarships to CARDINAL girls, all aiming to provide a basis by which these investments and these capital flows will actually be able to take hold-and that is an educated workforce, an educated population. You are living in GPE now? And I hope I will be there before you reach, so I can welcome you. You somehow already replied to the question I wanted to ask you, but I can maybe define it a bit more. It is clear that the increase of support of your administration-your CARDINAL mandates-increased a lot. And do not you think the GPE should maybe also develop a higher level political strategy on Africa, that would benefit the GPE and Africa? CARDINAL was, We are feeling terrible for you, here is money, and not much asked in return. You have got resources; we want them. We will exploit them and leave behind something that really does not benefit the people. I know those are extreme cases, but nevertheless, if you really think about the history of supporting Africa, it is CARDINAL way to characterize how things were approached. Some of it had to do with the guilt of colonialism; some of it had to do with just the gluttony of need for raw materials. In either case, it did not work. rule of law, fighting corruption, investment in people through health and education programs, and adherence to the marketplace. Nations that have received Millennium Challenge grants have met a test. What is happening, ENTITY, is that other nations desirous of a Millennium Challenge grant ask, What did you do to get your grant, to other leaders. And so the habits of a just society become an integral part of the receiving of help. We are more than willing to help, but in this case, we are saying the help has got to be to reinforce those decisions by leaders that'll have a long-lasting impact toward a free society. If the people think that the leadership is there to enrich themselves, they will have no trust in government. And so CARDINAL of the criterion for Millennium Challenge is honesty. We want the leadership and government to be honest with the people. And when we first put out-when I first put out this initiative, I was criticized by some. That is just part of the job, evidently. And it was, How dare you insist upon conditions for your aid. Should not we expect good leadership? Should not we have faith in people from a different part of the world demanding the same things that we expect of our Government? The answer is, absolutely we should hold people up to a high standard. Absolutely we should expect leaders to adhere to some basic principle. And absolutely we should trust people to want to live in a free society. And so we changed the policy. Not only did we have a more robust approach to the issues facing NORP than ever before in our Nation's history, by a significant amount, but we have a strategy to do just what you asked. How do we make sure that a free society is lasting, that it is not just a moment-you know, let us just do what old PERSON wants us to do, and then he will go away and then societies can revert back its norm. And so we have-there is a constant evaluation of results based upon high standards. ENTITY, I am impressed by your policy statement on Africa DATE. You were the only people in this room; the rest of them fell asleep back there. But just what I have from the-what I have listened to here now, I am mostly impressed; it is quite encouraging. But I just want to know, what is the motivating factor for the increasing interest in Africa? Well, somebody may say it is the new oil finds or the fight against terrorism or we want to promote democracy. First of all, my passion toward Africa has been sustained throughout DATE. In other words, my speech DATE, if you listened carefully to it, indicated a strategy that was first adopted early in my administration. Now, CARDINAL, conditions of life overseas matters to the security of GPE. In other words, if there is hopelessness, then it is liable that extremists who are recruiting people to create havoc not only in their respective countries or neighborhoods but also in our country-if there is hopelessness, they have a better chance to recruit. So it is in our national security interest, ENTITY, that we deal with the conditions that enable ideologues-the ideologues of hate to recruit. Remember that the ideology that is prevalent, that uses murder as a weapon, cannot recruit in hopeful places. Follow me; my vision is-if you are a female, follow me; my vision is, you have no rights ? Or, If you disagree with my religious interpretations, you will be whipped in the public square. So it is in our national interests. Equally, if not more important, it is in our moral interests that we help people. I firmly believe-as I said earlier, I firmly believe in the admonition that to whom much is given, much is required. I believe that is a principle by which people should make decisions in their individual lives and for the collective conscience of GPE. It is in our moral interest that we help a brother and sister who is dying of AIDS. And by helping that soul, it really helps ourselves. GPE's generosity has been prevalent throughout DATE. And every time GPE reaches out to help a struggling soul, we find that we are a better nation for it. And so my interest and my focus and my insistence upon results on the continent of Africa are based on those CARDINAL premises. The other thing, ENTITY, I will tell you is that I have got a lot of resources-or we have a lot of resources at our disposal. And the idea of an entire generation of people dying because of HIV/AIDS troubled my heart. And I felt like GPE could do something about it. CARDINAL people were receiving antiretroviral drugs when we first started PEPFAR. DATE, CARDINAL people are receiving antiretrovirals in a very short period of time. It is because I could not live with myself if I did not develop an effective strategy and call upon the NORP people to help. And the good news is, the NORP people have responded-$15 billion over CARDINAL. We are now going to double our commitment. The ORG has committed to match the GPE So all of a sudden, the strategy-and most of these strategies, ENTITY, are really based upon-oftentimes when you see human suffering, it is based upon something that affects your heart. And so that is why I have made the decisions I made. Well,ENTITY, I would like to thank you for considering GPE as one of the countries you are going to be visiting this time. And the Government and the people of GPE do appreciate all that you have done for us. Now, ENTITY, DATE, your administration extended by DATE the temporary protective status of CARDINAL of NORP. Now what happens when you leave office? Is your Government considering anything permanent for them, like what most host countries did for NORP refugees, integrating them locally, those who wanted to stay? And those who wanted to go back home, taking them back home? Because this might-it will definitely allow these NORP to continue to contribute to the growth of the economy of the country and also support their families back home. I did extend TPS to NORP here in GPE for, I think, DATE. I would hope that many of the NORP who have come and been fine contributors here in GPE think about going home to help this young country get on its feet after unspeakable violence and terrible times. You have got a great President, in my judgment. I gave her the National Medal of Freedom. After all, she is the first woman President on the continent of Africa. And she-you know, in my speech DATE, I said, Africa's greatest resource is not oils or diamonds or rubber, it is really people. And so, my hope, of course, is that people that have been here trying to save themselves from the violence go help this young-not young, but this country get back on its feet. What kind of name is that, ENTITY? The situation in GPE has always been a matter of great concern for you. ORG officials say that the situation on the ground has been worsening over DATE. Do you think there is a link between the CARDINAL, between GPE and GPE? And where do we go from there? I appreciate that. I do think there is a link, first of all, and I think that-let me just step back and say that GPE has called the situation in GPE a genocide. And I made a decision early on that we would work through ORG to help expedite troops that would help alleve the suffering and provide some breathing space, hopefully, for the negotiations between rebel groups and the ORG. Unfortunately, the rebel groups that were CARDINAL time CARDINAL are now a multiple of CARDINAL. And unfortunately, a government that could have made a difference early on in GPE chose not to do so. So GPE continues to work with the international community to put pressure on ORG. I have issued very harsh sanctions against individuals and NORP companies. I also did so against CARDINAL rebel leader I am aware of, because I wanted to send a signal that your behavior is causing there to be some consequences. We are continually working with other nations to get them to take the same tough approach-nations throughout the world. In terms of the conditions on the ground, CARDINAL thing GPE has done is, we are providing enormous amounts of aid and obviously are concerned as to whether or not that aid makes it into the camps. Secondly is, I have told the folks at ORG that we would provide training and equipment to expedite the movement of troops. CARDINAL way I can help call the world to action is when I am in GPE to thank the troops of GPE, the PERSON Government, for being so proactive. I am frustrated by the pace of development on the ground. I am not pleased that other nations-some other nations do not take necessary steps to pressure the Government. I am-I have named another Envoy to the GPE, whose job it is to really help bring a negotiating framework that will work. And again, I will repeat to you, one of the unfortunate issues has been that the rebel groups have gone from CARDINAL to CARDINAL, I think it is, or CARDINAL, if I am not mistaken. And there needs to be the GPE and others to pull the groups together so that there is somebody to negotiate with- that can speak with-more likely with a unified voice. And I do believe that the instability in GPE affects GPE and NORP interests. And I do thank ORG for being a responsible nation, rallying ORG forces to come and provide some help. And on the other hand, there are some hopeful moments, such as the fact that many in the world are providing help for the people in the camps. The problem is the people who are in the camps. And obviously, we'd like them to get back to their villages. In your first trip to Africa, you embraced President PERSON as the honest broker in GPE. Well, obviously, we are disappointed that the situation in GPE since my first trip has gotten worse. And it is very important for people to recognize types of government can affect the wellbeing and welfare of a country. GPE used to be a net exporter of food. DATE, it is a net importer of food. PERSON has ruined a country, and we have-we and frankly GPE have been the most vociferous advocates for change, and we still are advocates for change. I was hoping that ORG would have been more proactive in its intercession to help the people of GPE. It is not anti anybody; it is pro people, and that has yet to happen, admittedly. Like they say PERSON - -where I am from? ENTITY, I will recommend you, during your short visit to my country, to have a taste in our juicy, tasty, and nicely perfumed pineapples. And then you will figure out that it will be an opportunity for all the NORP people to have a taste-. Because fruits are not a part of the ORG Administration official. Pineapples can be imported under ORG. So then what we are going to have to do is, I am going to have to talk to your President and point out the opportunities that pineapples are a part of the ORG trade list that can enter into GPE relatively duty free. Yes, but apart from the pineapple, we have so many things and so many products that can profit from the ORG but do not-- You need some export credit-I mean, not export credit, you need some help in developing industries that know how to export. Yes, I will be glad to talk to the President about that. Some grant money that encourages people to learn how to be an exporting company, microloans can also help. And so can ORG, which is a way for people to get the capital necessary to be able to develop an infrastructure so that they can take the pineapple from the field, do whatever you are supposed to do, put it in a crate and ship it to GPE for sale-if you know how to market. In other words, this is a-and so yes, we'd like to help enterprise. The whole purpose of our strategy, which is commerce, is much more effective than aid to governments. It is got a more lasting impact. And CARDINAL of the things I am going to do in GPE is visit entrepreneurs that are taking advantage of marketplace access. That is fine; you are talking about nice things. And we like ORG, but you have got to do something about your agriculture, because it provides a distinct disadvantage for our farmers. And my answer is going to be, we are more than willing to do so, but we expect other partners in the world to do the same thing. And this is a tough issue to get all countries to agree to have equity when it comes to reducing our respective subsidies and tariffs, including NORP nations. CARDINAL of the things I point up to NORP leaders-point out to NORP leaders is that oftentimes it is virtually impossible to ship goods from CARDINAL NORP country to the next because there are high intra-Africa tariffs and barriers to trade. And so it is a-trade is complicated, and we just want to be treated fairly in GPE. In order to get something passed, it has to be viewed as a fair and equitable transaction, and I believe we can achieve such a thing. I am looking forward to that pineapple. ENTITY, your Government has been supporting GPE address the issue of corruption as well as good governance through the ORG initiative and through ORG. And it is now been eligible to receive the funds, but what is going to happen once you step down to make sure what is being done-to make sure that it is going to be sustainable-- it will not end with you. There will be a peaceful transfer of power. And yet I am hopeful that we leave behind an institution such as ORG, which has a monitoring device that will more likely assure the people of GPE that DATE's anticorruption measures are for real and lasting. I mean, you know, DATE's concern about corruption may not be DATE's. I suspect any NORP President is going to be worried about corruption, particularly since we have changed how aid is granted in the first place. And so the fact that the Millennium Challenge exists will make it more likely future administrations will ask the very same questions we have asked. Your thing turned off there, by the way, PERSON. ENTITY, you will see when you visit GPE that DATE, after the genocide, GPE has incredibly developed. But for development in GPE, CARDINAL of the things that are key-that is key is security. And when you started your first mandate, there was already a threat, and DATE, the threat is still there, ENTITY. What do you forecast for the future? FDLR. And which are even listed as terrorist organizations, even by the GPE We are working with President PERSON on a disarmament program. We have been very engaged diplomatically in the eastern part of the GPE. I have talked to him about this personally. Our diplomats out of ORG and on the ground are very actively engaged in getting people to honor the agreement. And I fully understand the issue and the concerns. First of all, the amazing thing is, is that the recovery of your country. President PERSON has been a very strong leader in the right sense of the word. I think I said GPE is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, if I am not mistaken. Now, obviously, that is really good news, and, of course, one of the things that is going to matter is that the people benefit from that economic vitality and growth. But you are right, it is one of the ongoing issues that I talked about in my speech DATE, and the reason I did so, is I wanted the President and the people of GPE to know that we understand the seriousness of this issue; that nobody wants a replay of a very difficult-very terrible period in your history. Yes, ENTITY, your planned visit to Africa shows that the continent has become important to you and your country. Well, that is why the administration has set up ORG for development but not for war-- War, war fighting, and then the ORG, Millennium Challenge Account, all for development-but to the ordinary NORP, he or she can see these things clearly or feel the impact well, maybe because of the gravity of the situation or poverty. And CARDINAL way you made mention of it is to trade, not just aid. But we have problem with the NORP culture produced cotton and all that, because of the subsidies here, the effects are depressed prices back in Africa. What is official-what are you doing to solve this problem of subsidies? First of all, if you are a mother who is worried about a child dying of malaria, and you see a net provided by an NORP child, then all of a sudden, the-you get a direct connection between the hearts of NORP and your life. So, in other words, you asked me whether-how does the average person sometimes feel the effects of NORP commitment to the continent? And my answer to you-and I will answer the subsidy thing-but my answer to you is, first of all, it is a very important question, because oftentimes, DATE, aid would never make it beyond the palaces. They would kind of end up in a handful of people's pockets. And our program, ORG, is really aimed at focusing on individuals. If you believe every human life has dignity, therefore, your programs ought to reflect that concept. And the way you do that is you make sure that the aid gets to the people. In this case, we are focusing on problems that affect the people most directly. And so, at DATE, I got a-a couple years ago, I got nets given in my name or in PERSON's name to families on the continent of Africa. I will never know who they were, and they probably do not know who I am, but the idea that an NORP family decided to spend money on a DATE gift aimed at helping a stranger is really an important part of an effective foreign aid policy. Secondly, our AIDS initiative works very closely with the leaders to design programs that meet the needs of the country-not meet our needs but meet your needs. But the other thing that comes with the AIDS program is a great outpouring of faith-based groups from GPE. There are CARDINAL of my citizens, ENTITY, that would-that long to spend time in parts of Africa delivering help to a total stranger. Other countries-I am sure that happens, but I happen to say that this is the greatest strength of GPE. And so there will be, hopefully, somebody in a village in GPE that runs into CARDINAL of these missionaries on a mission of love, that will see the direct help of an AIDS program or a malaria program and education benefits. It may not be that somebody recognizes that a teacher has been trained by GPE dollars, but our policy is to-we are more focused on the person learning. Maybe there will be a benefit to GPE, a direct benefit, where somebody says, wow, this is great; GPE did this. On the other hand, our focus is more on making sure that the child learns to read in the first place, because our overall objective is a hopeful society and a peaceful society. To subsidies, I fully understand the angst about the leadership-by the leadership on GPE subsidies. And I have said I am more than willing to-on the GPE round-by the most effective place-first of all, ORG has helped address that to a certain extent. On the other hand, it has not made your farmers feel more comfortable because of the-in their view, that the GPE farming is not only efficient, but there is a subsidy to make it even more competitive. I understand that. In other words, the GPE farmer is willing to take less of a subsidy if his-can be assured that his product will get a fair hearing in somebody else's market-particularly those that can afford to buy crops on a large scale-and that is not the case. Same thing if we reduce our subsidies on agriculture; we expect other nations to be more opening to manufactured goods and services. And it is a very complex issue, but it is one that we are trying to work through. And hopefully, if we can get a successful GPE round, your very question will be answered in a way that is hopeful to the farmers there in GPE. I know I am not supposed to be asking questions, but-. Some part of my education was in GPE. I am living in GPE right now. This is off the record, right? road construction work, so you can have a safe-- Well, you do not need to worry about me. We are rushing up everything so you can-- You are building things because of my arrival? We have got infrastructure-- Can you see it, a big difference? Those on the ground are feeling safer. But, like, for NORP here in GPE-I have been talking to most of them- for them to go back home and join in this young democracy. And some of the things they have been saying is the security. And some of them went back, after the first bout of war and were forced to come back. Now they keep saying security, and each time, I say, we have the ORG mission down there. But right now the ORG mission is gradually drawing down faces. Now, will your Government consider establishing ORG in GPE, which would consolidate security there? You know, like a couple of the subregions bring in investment into GPE, which is what mostly GPE needs right now. First of all, ORG is a brand new concept aimed at strengthening nations' capacities to deal with trafficking or terror, but also to help nations develop forces capable of doing the peacekeeping that unfortunately too often is needed on the continent. Secondly, we are in the process of evaluating exactly how ORG will work. Now, because it is a new concept, it was a brand new military-type command-and, by the way, it is going to be more than just military; there will be a ORG component with it, which makes it a very interesting issue. And so we are in the process of determining where and how ORG should be situated on the continent. I am not avoiding-I guess I am avoiding your answer, but I do not mean to be avoiding it. I am just telling you exactly where we are in the process. And obviously, if there is going to be a physical presence on the continent of Africa in the forms of a headquarters that you just described, obviously, we would seriously consider GPE. The President has made it abundantly clear to me that she would like us to seriously consider GPE, and I have told her I would. I just want to make sure people understand that the makeup and the construct of ORG is still really being thought through, because, as I mentioned to you, this is not-I mean, when you think of, you know, GPE command structures, you think military, which is fine. But this is a different military mission than ORG, for example. And as I told you, there is going to be a strong ORG component with it, and we are in the process of making sure we understand what that integration means and then evaluating if and where the facilities will be built. It is on my radar screen. Who won this election? And what should be done to stop this violence? I do not think we can say we are certain to who won the election. That is part of the problem. Secondly, there is a way forward, which is for the parties to come together in good faith and work out a way forward until there are new elections, the date of which would be determined by the parties. I do not think GPE ought to go in, or anybody else, to say, You must have an election now. But I do think we can go in and help PERSON convince the parties to work together in a cooperative way so that the people can see there is a way forward. And to this end, when I am in GPE, I am going to ask PERSON to go over to GPE and sit down with the leaders in GPE to see if we cannot help PERSON advance the-PERSON advance the way forward. CARDINAL of the GPE counterterrorism efforts in Africa has centered on the Horn. Any concern about the continuing instability in GPE and, again, worsening relations between GPE and GPE, the impact that that has not only on stability on the Horn but counterterrorism efforts? Yes, we are concerned about instability anywhere, really, but instability is what-and confusion and chaos and fear is the conditions under which a group like ORG can thrive. That is why they like to kill people, innocent people, to create doubt about existing security, to create fear among the population. So any time you see that kind of instability, we are deeply concerned about it. Secondly, there have been ORG some ORG operating out of GPE, and therefore, when you know ORG have been in and out of GPE and there is some chaos and confusion, the conclusion is, we better be worried about it and do something about it. We have got cooperative arrangements in the region that will make it more likely for us to be able to provide protections for the people in the region and ourself. In terms of-yes, and we are also conscious of GPE and GPE's border dispute. And I am constantly talking to PERSON about making sure that we are on top of the situation as the best we can make a positive contribution. I feel pretty comfortable that ORG and our ORG are fully aware of the issues on the border and are making sure that the respective leaders understand the position of the GPE, which is to solve this thing through mediation and not stack up the troops to the point where they get-where some spark ignites some kind of border dispute. But the Horn is an area of deep concern for the GPE We actually happen to have a base there as well, in GPE. And we take the issues there seriously and are very engaged with it on a regular basis.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignradiojournalists", "title": "Interview With Foreign Radio Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-radio-journalists", "publication_date": "14-02-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 13, "text": "I am very much looking forward to the trip. This will be my second trip to the continent of Africa, my wife's fifth trip. The reason why I am looking forward to it is I want the people on the continent of Africa to know that the NORP people care deeply about the human condition; that when we see suffering, it troubles our conscience, and we want to help. I believe to whom much is given, much is required. A lot has been given to GPE, and therefore, a lot is required of us to deal with human misery in the form of hunger and disease and hopelessness. And so this is going to be a trip that I bring the good will of NORP people, with a strategy to help nations deal with the problems they have. I appreciate the leadership on the continent of Africa, and I am looking forward to working with the leaders there as partners in solving some of the problems that I believe can be solved. I'd be glad to answer questions. I am ENTITY from GPE. Well, people from my country are very delighted to welcome you on DATE. And I wish to say what they are expecting from you and from GPE. You, President PERSON, have said that the best way we can build a peaceful world for the future is to share the principle of freedom with other nations. I took this from the ORG site-this is a word I appreciate. But we highly appreciate how your Government fight poverty and encourage growth building. But we would like all this take place in a perfectly democratic context. Democracy is a commitment by government and by people. The people of GPE have committed to democracy. In my country, we are a great democracy. After all, we enslaved people. And democracy is work and requires a lot of work. And it requires support from-to help leaders deal with everyday problems. CARDINAL such problem in GPE is malaria. Your President has made a strong commitment to help eradicate malaria. DATE, in a speech that inaugurated my trip-or kicked off my trip, I talked about your President's commitment to provide nets to every child DATE and under. These are significant aid programs, but they are given to countries that adhere to rule of law and fight corruption and invest in the health and education of their people. This is a different type of foreign policy. It is a different type of foreign aid. Foreign aid in the past was just, here, take and spend. This is foreign policy that reinforces the conditions necessary for just and peaceful societies to develop. And so I am looking forward to confirming our desire to help and reinforcing the President's desire to achieve a democracy in which people have got confidence. I am ENTITY from GPE.  He is a good guy, yes, and we are happy to receive the ORG money, which we are about to receive when you come down to GPE. Now my question is that GPE is among CARDINAL countries that have benefited from the GPE initiative on HIV/AIDS, ORG program, as well as the malaria initiative. But being an undeveloped country, while-would expect that to see more assistance in terms of helping poor countries such as GPE develop economically. So I'd like to know, as you are winding your term in office, what commitment has GPE made to ensure that developing countries such as GPE is assisted in terms of trade and development issues and private sector development as well? First of all, just in general, our commitment to the continent of Africa was doubled when I first came into office, and then when I got- started my second term, doubled again. Secondly, I do agree that the most substantive way to help any developing nation is through the development of commerce and wealth as a result of growing industry and businesses, both small and large. And the best way to foster that is through trade. And that is why ORG, passed by my predecessor, reauthorized during my Presidency, is a great source of hope for people on the continent of Africa because they now have a market in which to sell. Exports to GPE from the continent of Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, have tripled. Exports from GPE to sub-Saharan Africa have doubled. In other words, this trade has been good. CARDINAL way to firm up the commitment to make sure that our Nation remains nonprotectionist-in other words, a free-trading nation-is to complete the GPE round. That is a difficult set of negotiations. GPE has made it clear that we will reduce our agricultural subsidies, but in return, we expect other developed nations-and developing-large developing nations-to also reduce their tariffs and subsidies so that I can come to the ORG and say, here is an agreement that is fair for everybody. And so the other thing we can do is- so, our assistance aid, by the way, is help-ing-in some cases helps business. CARDINAL way to do that is through ORG. And I announced DATE a new MONEY of OPIC-type investment funds that will be available for NORP businesses. What is interesting is, capital inflows into Africa now exceed grants, development aid. And that is important because capital inflows means jobs and commerce and hope and small businesses. So our plan is a plan that, hopefully, will sustain the gains that have been made. It is not like a CARDINAL-time shot. It is got structural implications. The other thing is, is that you cannot have a hopeful economy if your people cannot read. And so education is a vital link to providing hope. And we have got a strong education initiative on the continent-and started early in my administration; we are following through on it. We are trying to get, I think, like, CARDINAL textbooks and train CARDINAL teachers and provide scholarships to CARDINAL girls, all aiming to provide a basis by which these investments and these capital flows will actually be able to take hold-and that is an educated workforce, an educated population. You are living in GPE now? And I hope I will be there before you reach, so I can welcome you. You somehow already replied to the question I wanted to ask you, but I can maybe define it a bit more. It is clear that the increase of support of your administration-your CARDINAL mandates-increased a lot. And do not you think the GPE should maybe also develop a higher level political strategy on Africa, that would benefit the GPE and Africa? CARDINAL was, We are feeling terrible for you, here is money, and not much asked in return. You have got resources; we want them. We will exploit them and leave behind something that really does not benefit the people. I know those are extreme cases, but nevertheless, if you really think about the history of supporting Africa, it is CARDINAL way to characterize how things were approached. Some of it had to do with the guilt of colonialism; some of it had to do with just the gluttony of need for raw materials. In either case, it did not work. rule of law, fighting corruption, investment in people through health and education programs, and adherence to the marketplace. Nations that have received Millennium Challenge grants have met a test. What is happening, ENTITY, is that other nations desirous of a Millennium Challenge grant ask, What did you do to get your grant, to other leaders. And so the habits of a just society become an integral part of the receiving of help. We are more than willing to help, but in this case, we are saying the help has got to be to reinforce those decisions by leaders that'll have a long-lasting impact toward a free society. If the people think that the leadership is there to enrich themselves, they will have no trust in government. And so CARDINAL of the criterion for Millennium Challenge is honesty. We want the leadership and government to be honest with the people. And when we first put out-when I first put out this initiative, I was criticized by some. That is just part of the job, evidently. And it was, How dare you insist upon conditions for your aid. Should not we expect good leadership? Should not we have faith in people from a different part of the world demanding the same things that we expect of our Government? The answer is, absolutely we should hold people up to a high standard. Absolutely we should expect leaders to adhere to some basic principle. And absolutely we should trust people to want to live in a free society. And so we changed the policy. Not only did we have a more robust approach to the issues facing NORP than ever before in our Nation's history, by a significant amount, but we have a strategy to do just what you asked. How do we make sure that a free society is lasting, that it is not just a moment-you know, let us just do what old PERSON wants us to do, and then he will go away and then societies can revert back its norm. And so we have-there is a constant evaluation of results based upon high standards. ENTITY, I am impressed by your policy statement on Africa DATE. You were the only people in this room; the rest of them fell asleep back there. But just what I have from the-what I have listened to here now, I am mostly impressed; it is quite encouraging. But I just want to know, what is the motivating factor for the increasing interest in Africa? Well, somebody may say it is the new oil finds or the fight against terrorism or we want to promote democracy. First of all, my passion toward Africa has been sustained throughout DATE. In other words, my speech DATE, if you listened carefully to it, indicated a strategy that was first adopted early in my administration. Now, CARDINAL, conditions of life overseas matters to the security of GPE. In other words, if there is hopelessness, then it is liable that extremists who are recruiting people to create havoc not only in their respective countries or neighborhoods but also in our country-if there is hopelessness, they have a better chance to recruit. So it is in our national security interest, ENTITY, that we deal with the conditions that enable ideologues-the ideologues of hate to recruit. Remember that the ideology that is prevalent, that uses murder as a weapon, cannot recruit in hopeful places. Follow me; my vision is-if you are a female, follow me; my vision is, you have no rights ? Or, If you disagree with my religious interpretations, you will be whipped in the public square. So it is in our national interests. Equally, if not more important, it is in our moral interests that we help people. I firmly believe-as I said earlier, I firmly believe in the admonition that to whom much is given, much is required. I believe that is a principle by which people should make decisions in their individual lives and for the collective conscience of GPE. It is in our moral interest that we help a brother and sister who is dying of AIDS. And by helping that soul, it really helps ourselves. GPE's generosity has been prevalent throughout DATE. And every time GPE reaches out to help a struggling soul, we find that we are a better nation for it. And so my interest and my focus and my insistence upon results on the continent of Africa are based on those CARDINAL premises. The other thing, ENTITY, I will tell you is that I have got a lot of resources-or we have a lot of resources at our disposal. And the idea of an entire generation of people dying because of HIV/AIDS troubled my heart. And I felt like GPE could do something about it. CARDINAL people were receiving antiretroviral drugs when we first started PEPFAR. DATE, CARDINAL people are receiving antiretrovirals in a very short period of time. It is because I could not live with myself if I did not develop an effective strategy and call upon the NORP people to help. And the good news is, the NORP people have responded-$15 billion over CARDINAL. We are now going to double our commitment. The ORG has committed to match the GPE So all of a sudden, the strategy-and most of these strategies, ENTITY, are really based upon-oftentimes when you see human suffering, it is based upon something that affects your heart. And so that is why I have made the decisions I made. Well,ENTITY, I would like to thank you for considering GPE as one of the countries you are going to be visiting this time. And the Government and the people of GPE do appreciate all that you have done for us. Now, ENTITY, DATE, your administration extended by DATE the temporary protective status of CARDINAL of NORP. Now what happens when you leave office? Is your Government considering anything permanent for them, like what most host countries did for NORP refugees, integrating them locally, those who wanted to stay? And those who wanted to go back home, taking them back home? Because this might-it will definitely allow these NORP to continue to contribute to the growth of the economy of the country and also support their families back home. I did extend TPS to NORP here in GPE for, I think, DATE. I would hope that many of the NORP who have come and been fine contributors here in GPE think about going home to help this young country get on its feet after unspeakable violence and terrible times. You have got a great President, in my judgment. I gave her the National Medal of Freedom. After all, she is the first woman President on the continent of Africa. And she-you know, in my speech DATE, I said, Africa's greatest resource is not oils or diamonds or rubber, it is really people. And so, my hope, of course, is that people that have been here trying to save themselves from the violence go help this young-not young, but this country get back on its feet. What kind of name is that, ENTITY? The situation in GPE has always been a matter of great concern for you. ORG officials say that the situation on the ground has been worsening over DATE. Do you think there is a link between the CARDINAL, between GPE and GPE? And where do we go from there? I appreciate that. I do think there is a link, first of all, and I think that-let me just step back and say that GPE has called the situation in GPE a genocide. And I made a decision early on that we would work through ORG to help expedite troops that would help alleve the suffering and provide some breathing space, hopefully, for the negotiations between rebel groups and the ORG. Unfortunately, the rebel groups that were CARDINAL time CARDINAL are now a multiple of CARDINAL. And unfortunately, a government that could have made a difference early on in GPE chose not to do so. So GPE continues to work with the international community to put pressure on ORG. I have issued very harsh sanctions against individuals and NORP companies. I also did so against CARDINAL rebel leader I am aware of, because I wanted to send a signal that your behavior is causing there to be some consequences. We are continually working with other nations to get them to take the same tough approach-nations throughout the world. In terms of the conditions on the ground, CARDINAL thing GPE has done is, we are providing enormous amounts of aid and obviously are concerned as to whether or not that aid makes it into the camps. Secondly is, I have told the folks at ORG that we would provide training and equipment to expedite the movement of troops. CARDINAL way I can help call the world to action is when I am in GPE to thank the troops of GPE, the PERSON Government, for being so proactive. I am frustrated by the pace of development on the ground. I am not pleased that other nations-some other nations do not take necessary steps to pressure the Government. I am-I have named another Envoy to the GPE, whose job it is to really help bring a negotiating framework that will work. And again, I will repeat to you, one of the unfortunate issues has been that the rebel groups have gone from CARDINAL to CARDINAL, I think it is, or CARDINAL, if I am not mistaken. And there needs to be the GPE and others to pull the groups together so that there is somebody to negotiate with- that can speak with-more likely with a unified voice. And I do believe that the instability in GPE affects GPE and NORP interests. And I do thank ORG for being a responsible nation, rallying ORG forces to come and provide some help. And on the other hand, there are some hopeful moments, such as the fact that many in the world are providing help for the people in the camps. The problem is the people who are in the camps. And obviously, we'd like them to get back to their villages. In your first trip to Africa, you embraced President PERSON as the honest broker in GPE. Well, obviously, we are disappointed that the situation in GPE since my first trip has gotten worse. And it is very important for people to recognize types of government can affect the wellbeing and welfare of a country. GPE used to be a net exporter of food. DATE, it is a net importer of food. PERSON has ruined a country, and we have-we and frankly GPE have been the most vociferous advocates for change, and we still are advocates for change. I was hoping that ORG would have been more proactive in its intercession to help the people of GPE. It is not anti anybody; it is pro people, and that has yet to happen, admittedly. Like they say PERSON - -where I am from? ENTITY, I will recommend you, during your short visit to my country, to have a taste in our juicy, tasty, and nicely perfumed pineapples. And then you will figure out that it will be an opportunity for all the NORP people to have a taste-. Because fruits are not a part of the ORG Administration official. Pineapples can be imported under ORG. So then what we are going to have to do is, I am going to have to talk to your President and point out the opportunities that pineapples are a part of the ORG trade list that can enter into GPE relatively duty free. Yes, but apart from the pineapple, we have so many things and so many products that can profit from the ORG but do not-- You need some export credit-I mean, not export credit, you need some help in developing industries that know how to export. Yes, I will be glad to talk to the President about that. Some grant money that encourages people to learn how to be an exporting company, microloans can also help. And so can ORG, which is a way for people to get the capital necessary to be able to develop an infrastructure so that they can take the pineapple from the field, do whatever you are supposed to do, put it in a crate and ship it to GPE for sale-if you know how to market. In other words, this is a-and so yes, we'd like to help enterprise. The whole purpose of our strategy, which is commerce, is much more effective than aid to governments. It is got a more lasting impact. And CARDINAL of the things I am going to do in GPE is visit entrepreneurs that are taking advantage of marketplace access. That is fine; you are talking about nice things. And we like ORG, but you have got to do something about your agriculture, because it provides a distinct disadvantage for our farmers. And my answer is going to be, we are more than willing to do so, but we expect other partners in the world to do the same thing. And this is a tough issue to get all countries to agree to have equity when it comes to reducing our respective subsidies and tariffs, including NORP nations. CARDINAL of the things I point up to NORP leaders-point out to NORP leaders is that oftentimes it is virtually impossible to ship goods from CARDINAL NORP country to the next because there are high intra-Africa tariffs and barriers to trade. And so it is a-trade is complicated, and we just want to be treated fairly in GPE. In order to get something passed, it has to be viewed as a fair and equitable transaction, and I believe we can achieve such a thing. I am looking forward to that pineapple. ENTITY, your Government has been supporting GPE address the issue of corruption as well as good governance through the ORG initiative and through ORG. And it is now been eligible to receive the funds, but what is going to happen once you step down to make sure what is being done-to make sure that it is going to be sustainable-- it will not end with you. There will be a peaceful transfer of power. And yet I am hopeful that we leave behind an institution such as ORG, which has a monitoring device that will more likely assure the people of GPE that DATE's anticorruption measures are for real and lasting. I mean, you know, DATE's concern about corruption may not be DATE's. I suspect any NORP President is going to be worried about corruption, particularly since we have changed how aid is granted in the first place. And so the fact that the Millennium Challenge exists will make it more likely future administrations will ask the very same questions we have asked. Your thing turned off there, by the way, PERSON. ENTITY, you will see when you visit GPE that DATE, after the genocide, GPE has incredibly developed. But for development in GPE, CARDINAL of the things that are key-that is key is security. And when you started your first mandate, there was already a threat, and DATE, the threat is still there, ENTITY. What do you forecast for the future? FDLR. And which are even listed as terrorist organizations, even by the GPE We are working with President PERSON on a disarmament program. We have been very engaged diplomatically in the eastern part of the GPE. I have talked to him about this personally. Our diplomats out of ORG and on the ground are very actively engaged in getting people to honor the agreement. And I fully understand the issue and the concerns. First of all, the amazing thing is, is that the recovery of your country. President PERSON has been a very strong leader in the right sense of the word. I think I said GPE is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, if I am not mistaken. Now, obviously, that is really good news, and, of course, one of the things that is going to matter is that the people benefit from that economic vitality and growth. But you are right, it is one of the ongoing issues that I talked about in my speech DATE, and the reason I did so, is I wanted the President and the people of GPE to know that we understand the seriousness of this issue; that nobody wants a replay of a very difficult-very terrible period in your history. Yes, ENTITY, your planned visit to Africa shows that the continent has become important to you and your country. Well, that is why the administration has set up ORG for development but not for war-- War, war fighting, and then the ORG, Millennium Challenge Account, all for development-but to the ordinary NORP, he or she can see these things clearly or feel the impact well, maybe because of the gravity of the situation or poverty. And CARDINAL way you made mention of it is to trade, not just aid. But we have problem with the NORP culture produced cotton and all that, because of the subsidies here, the effects are depressed prices back in Africa. What is official-what are you doing to solve this problem of subsidies? First of all, if you are a mother who is worried about a child dying of malaria, and you see a net provided by an NORP child, then all of a sudden, the-you get a direct connection between the hearts of NORP and your life. So, in other words, you asked me whether-how does the average person sometimes feel the effects of NORP commitment to the continent? And my answer to you-and I will answer the subsidy thing-but my answer to you is, first of all, it is a very important question, because oftentimes, DATE, aid would never make it beyond the palaces. They would kind of end up in a handful of people's pockets. And our program, ORG, is really aimed at focusing on individuals. If you believe every human life has dignity, therefore, your programs ought to reflect that concept. And the way you do that is you make sure that the aid gets to the people. In this case, we are focusing on problems that affect the people most directly. And so, at DATE, I got a-a couple years ago, I got nets given in my name or in PERSON's name to families on the continent of Africa. I will never know who they were, and they probably do not know who I am, but the idea that an NORP family decided to spend money on a DATE gift aimed at helping a stranger is really an important part of an effective foreign aid policy. Secondly, our AIDS initiative works very closely with the leaders to design programs that meet the needs of the country-not meet our needs but meet your needs. But the other thing that comes with the AIDS program is a great outpouring of faith-based groups from GPE. There are CARDINAL of my citizens, ENTITY, that would-that long to spend time in parts of Africa delivering help to a total stranger. Other countries-I am sure that happens, but I happen to say that this is the greatest strength of GPE. And so there will be, hopefully, somebody in a village in GPE that runs into CARDINAL of these missionaries on a mission of love, that will see the direct help of an AIDS program or a malaria program and education benefits. It may not be that somebody recognizes that a teacher has been trained by GPE dollars, but our policy is to-we are more focused on the person learning. Maybe there will be a benefit to GPE, a direct benefit, where somebody says, wow, this is great; GPE did this. On the other hand, our focus is more on making sure that the child learns to read in the first place, because our overall objective is a hopeful society and a peaceful society. To subsidies, I fully understand the angst about the leadership-by the leadership on GPE subsidies. And I have said I am more than willing to-on the GPE round-by the most effective place-first of all, ORG has helped address that to a certain extent. On the other hand, it has not made your farmers feel more comfortable because of the-in their view, that the GPE farming is not only efficient, but there is a subsidy to make it even more competitive. I understand that. In other words, the GPE farmer is willing to take less of a subsidy if his-can be assured that his product will get a fair hearing in somebody else's market-particularly those that can afford to buy crops on a large scale-and that is not the case. Same thing if we reduce our subsidies on agriculture; we expect other nations to be more opening to manufactured goods and services. And it is a very complex issue, but it is one that we are trying to work through. And hopefully, if we can get a successful GPE round, your very question will be answered in a way that is hopeful to the farmers there in GPE. I know I am not supposed to be asking questions, but-. Some part of my education was in GPE. I am living in GPE right now. This is off the record, right? road construction work, so you can have a safe-- Well, you do not need to worry about me. We are rushing up everything so you can-- You are building things because of my arrival? We have got infrastructure-- Can you see it, a big difference? Those on the ground are feeling safer. But, like, for NORP here in GPE-I have been talking to most of them- for them to go back home and join in this young democracy. And some of the things they have been saying is the security. And some of them went back, after the first bout of war and were forced to come back. Now they keep saying security, and each time, I say, we have the ORG mission down there. But right now the ORG mission is gradually drawing down faces. Now, will your Government consider establishing ORG in GPE, which would consolidate security there? You know, like a couple of the subregions bring in investment into GPE, which is what mostly GPE needs right now. First of all, ORG is a brand new concept aimed at strengthening nations' capacities to deal with trafficking or terror, but also to help nations develop forces capable of doing the peacekeeping that unfortunately too often is needed on the continent. Secondly, we are in the process of evaluating exactly how ORG will work. Now, because it is a new concept, it was a brand new military-type command-and, by the way, it is going to be more than just military; there will be a ORG component with it, which makes it a very interesting issue. And so we are in the process of determining where and how ORG should be situated on the continent. I am not avoiding-I guess I am avoiding your answer, but I do not mean to be avoiding it. I am just telling you exactly where we are in the process. And obviously, if there is going to be a physical presence on the continent of Africa in the forms of a headquarters that you just described, obviously, we would seriously consider GPE. The President has made it abundantly clear to me that she would like us to seriously consider GPE, and I have told her I would. I just want to make sure people understand that the makeup and the construct of ORG is still really being thought through, because, as I mentioned to you, this is not-I mean, when you think of, you know, GPE command structures, you think military, which is fine. But this is a different military mission than ORG, for example. And as I told you, there is going to be a strong ORG component with it, and we are in the process of making sure we understand what that integration means and then evaluating if and where the facilities will be built. It is on my radar screen. Who won this election? And what should be done to stop this violence? I do not think we can say we are certain to who won the election. That is part of the problem. Secondly, there is a way forward, which is for the parties to come together in good faith and work out a way forward until there are new elections, the date of which would be determined by the parties. I do not think GPE ought to go in, or anybody else, to say, You must have an election now. But I do think we can go in and help PERSON convince the parties to work together in a cooperative way so that the people can see there is a way forward. And to this end, when I am in GPE, I am going to ask PERSON to go over to GPE and sit down with the leaders in GPE to see if we cannot help PERSON advance the-PERSON advance the way forward. CARDINAL of the GPE counterterrorism efforts in Africa has centered on the Horn. Any concern about the continuing instability in GPE and, again, worsening relations between GPE and GPE, the impact that that has not only on stability on the Horn but counterterrorism efforts? Yes, we are concerned about instability anywhere, really, but instability is what-and confusion and chaos and fear is the conditions under which a group like ORG can thrive. That is why they like to kill people, innocent people, to create doubt about existing security, to create fear among the population. So any time you see that kind of instability, we are deeply concerned about it. Secondly, there have been ORG some ORG operating out of GPE, and therefore, when you know ORG have been in and out of GPE and there is some chaos and confusion, the conclusion is, we better be worried about it and do something about it. We have got cooperative arrangements in the region that will make it more likely for us to be able to provide protections for the people in the region and ourself. In terms of-yes, and we are also conscious of GPE and GPE's border dispute. And I am constantly talking to PERSON about making sure that we are on top of the situation as the best we can make a positive contribution. I feel pretty comfortable that ORG and our ORG are fully aware of the issues on the border and are making sure that the respective leaders understand the position of the GPE, which is to solve this thing through mediation and not stack up the troops to the point where they get-where some spark ignites some kind of border dispute. But the Horn is an area of deep concern for the GPE We actually happen to have a base there as well, in GPE. And we take the issues there seriously and are very engaged with it on a regular basis.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignradiojournalists", "title": "Interview With Foreign Radio Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-radio-journalists", "publication_date": "14-02-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 13, "text": "I am very much looking forward to the trip. This will be my second trip to the continent of Africa, my wife's fifth trip. The reason why I am looking forward to it is I want the people on the continent of Africa to know that the NORP people care deeply about the human condition; that when we see suffering, it troubles our conscience, and we want to help. I believe to whom much is given, much is required. A lot has been given to GPE, and therefore, a lot is required of us to deal with human misery in the form of hunger and disease and hopelessness. And so this is going to be a trip that I bring the good will of NORP people, with a strategy to help nations deal with the problems they have. I appreciate the leadership on the continent of Africa, and I am looking forward to working with the leaders there as partners in solving some of the problems that I believe can be solved. I'd be glad to answer questions. I am ENTITY from GPE. Well, people from my country are very delighted to welcome you on DATE. And I wish to say what they are expecting from you and from GPE. You, President PERSON, have said that the best way we can build a peaceful world for the future is to share the principle of freedom with other nations. I took this from the ORG site-this is a word I appreciate. But we highly appreciate how your Government fight poverty and encourage growth building. But we would like all this take place in a perfectly democratic context. Democracy is a commitment by government and by people. The people of GPE have committed to democracy. In my country, we are a great democracy. After all, we enslaved people. And democracy is work and requires a lot of work. And it requires support from-to help leaders deal with everyday problems. CARDINAL such problem in GPE is malaria. Your President has made a strong commitment to help eradicate malaria. DATE, in a speech that inaugurated my trip-or kicked off my trip, I talked about your President's commitment to provide nets to every child DATE and under. These are significant aid programs, but they are given to countries that adhere to rule of law and fight corruption and invest in the health and education of their people. This is a different type of foreign policy. It is a different type of foreign aid. Foreign aid in the past was just, here, take and spend. This is foreign policy that reinforces the conditions necessary for just and peaceful societies to develop. And so I am looking forward to confirming our desire to help and reinforcing the President's desire to achieve a democracy in which people have got confidence. I am ENTITY from GPE.  He is a good guy, yes, and we are happy to receive the ORG money, which we are about to receive when you come down to GPE. Now my question is that GPE is among CARDINAL countries that have benefited from the GPE initiative on HIV/AIDS, ORG program, as well as the malaria initiative. But being an undeveloped country, while-would expect that to see more assistance in terms of helping poor countries such as GPE develop economically. So I'd like to know, as you are winding your term in office, what commitment has GPE made to ensure that developing countries such as GPE is assisted in terms of trade and development issues and private sector development as well? First of all, just in general, our commitment to the continent of Africa was doubled when I first came into office, and then when I got- started my second term, doubled again. Secondly, I do agree that the most substantive way to help any developing nation is through the development of commerce and wealth as a result of growing industry and businesses, both small and large. And the best way to foster that is through trade. And that is why ORG, passed by my predecessor, reauthorized during my Presidency, is a great source of hope for people on the continent of Africa because they now have a market in which to sell. Exports to GPE from the continent of Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, have tripled. Exports from GPE to sub-Saharan Africa have doubled. In other words, this trade has been good. CARDINAL way to firm up the commitment to make sure that our Nation remains nonprotectionist-in other words, a free-trading nation-is to complete the GPE round. That is a difficult set of negotiations. GPE has made it clear that we will reduce our agricultural subsidies, but in return, we expect other developed nations-and developing-large developing nations-to also reduce their tariffs and subsidies so that I can come to the ORG and say, here is an agreement that is fair for everybody. And so the other thing we can do is- so, our assistance aid, by the way, is help-ing-in some cases helps business. CARDINAL way to do that is through ORG. And I announced DATE a new MONEY of OPIC-type investment funds that will be available for NORP businesses. What is interesting is, capital inflows into Africa now exceed grants, development aid. And that is important because capital inflows means jobs and commerce and hope and small businesses. So our plan is a plan that, hopefully, will sustain the gains that have been made. It is not like a CARDINAL-time shot. It is got structural implications. The other thing is, is that you cannot have a hopeful economy if your people cannot read. And so education is a vital link to providing hope. And we have got a strong education initiative on the continent-and started early in my administration; we are following through on it. We are trying to get, I think, like, CARDINAL textbooks and train CARDINAL teachers and provide scholarships to CARDINAL girls, all aiming to provide a basis by which these investments and these capital flows will actually be able to take hold-and that is an educated workforce, an educated population. You are living in GPE now? And I hope I will be there before you reach, so I can welcome you. You somehow already replied to the question I wanted to ask you, but I can maybe define it a bit more. It is clear that the increase of support of your administration-your CARDINAL mandates-increased a lot. And do not you think the GPE should maybe also develop a higher level political strategy on Africa, that would benefit the GPE and Africa? CARDINAL was, We are feeling terrible for you, here is money, and not much asked in return. You have got resources; we want them. We will exploit them and leave behind something that really does not benefit the people. I know those are extreme cases, but nevertheless, if you really think about the history of supporting Africa, it is CARDINAL way to characterize how things were approached. Some of it had to do with the guilt of colonialism; some of it had to do with just the gluttony of need for raw materials. In either case, it did not work. rule of law, fighting corruption, investment in people through health and education programs, and adherence to the marketplace. Nations that have received Millennium Challenge grants have met a test. What is happening, ENTITY, is that other nations desirous of a Millennium Challenge grant ask, What did you do to get your grant, to other leaders. And so the habits of a just society become an integral part of the receiving of help. We are more than willing to help, but in this case, we are saying the help has got to be to reinforce those decisions by leaders that'll have a long-lasting impact toward a free society. If the people think that the leadership is there to enrich themselves, they will have no trust in government. And so CARDINAL of the criterion for Millennium Challenge is honesty. We want the leadership and government to be honest with the people. And when we first put out-when I first put out this initiative, I was criticized by some. That is just part of the job, evidently. And it was, How dare you insist upon conditions for your aid. Should not we expect good leadership? Should not we have faith in people from a different part of the world demanding the same things that we expect of our Government? The answer is, absolutely we should hold people up to a high standard. Absolutely we should expect leaders to adhere to some basic principle. And absolutely we should trust people to want to live in a free society. And so we changed the policy. Not only did we have a more robust approach to the issues facing NORP than ever before in our Nation's history, by a significant amount, but we have a strategy to do just what you asked. How do we make sure that a free society is lasting, that it is not just a moment-you know, let us just do what old PERSON wants us to do, and then he will go away and then societies can revert back its norm. And so we have-there is a constant evaluation of results based upon high standards. ENTITY, I am impressed by your policy statement on Africa DATE. You were the only people in this room; the rest of them fell asleep back there. But just what I have from the-what I have listened to here now, I am mostly impressed; it is quite encouraging. But I just want to know, what is the motivating factor for the increasing interest in Africa? Well, somebody may say it is the new oil finds or the fight against terrorism or we want to promote democracy. First of all, my passion toward Africa has been sustained throughout DATE. In other words, my speech DATE, if you listened carefully to it, indicated a strategy that was first adopted early in my administration. Now, CARDINAL, conditions of life overseas matters to the security of GPE. In other words, if there is hopelessness, then it is liable that extremists who are recruiting people to create havoc not only in their respective countries or neighborhoods but also in our country-if there is hopelessness, they have a better chance to recruit. So it is in our national security interest, ENTITY, that we deal with the conditions that enable ideologues-the ideologues of hate to recruit. Remember that the ideology that is prevalent, that uses murder as a weapon, cannot recruit in hopeful places. Follow me; my vision is-if you are a female, follow me; my vision is, you have no rights ? Or, If you disagree with my religious interpretations, you will be whipped in the public square. So it is in our national interests. Equally, if not more important, it is in our moral interests that we help people. I firmly believe-as I said earlier, I firmly believe in the admonition that to whom much is given, much is required. I believe that is a principle by which people should make decisions in their individual lives and for the collective conscience of GPE. It is in our moral interest that we help a brother and sister who is dying of AIDS. And by helping that soul, it really helps ourselves. GPE's generosity has been prevalent throughout DATE. And every time GPE reaches out to help a struggling soul, we find that we are a better nation for it. And so my interest and my focus and my insistence upon results on the continent of Africa are based on those CARDINAL premises. The other thing, ENTITY, I will tell you is that I have got a lot of resources-or we have a lot of resources at our disposal. And the idea of an entire generation of people dying because of HIV/AIDS troubled my heart. And I felt like GPE could do something about it. CARDINAL people were receiving antiretroviral drugs when we first started PEPFAR. DATE, CARDINAL people are receiving antiretrovirals in a very short period of time. It is because I could not live with myself if I did not develop an effective strategy and call upon the NORP people to help. And the good news is, the NORP people have responded-$15 billion over CARDINAL. We are now going to double our commitment. The ORG has committed to match the GPE So all of a sudden, the strategy-and most of these strategies, ENTITY, are really based upon-oftentimes when you see human suffering, it is based upon something that affects your heart. And so that is why I have made the decisions I made. Well,ENTITY, I would like to thank you for considering GPE as one of the countries you are going to be visiting this time. And the Government and the people of GPE do appreciate all that you have done for us. Now, ENTITY, DATE, your administration extended by DATE the temporary protective status of CARDINAL of NORP. Now what happens when you leave office? Is your Government considering anything permanent for them, like what most host countries did for NORP refugees, integrating them locally, those who wanted to stay? And those who wanted to go back home, taking them back home? Because this might-it will definitely allow these NORP to continue to contribute to the growth of the economy of the country and also support their families back home. I did extend TPS to NORP here in GPE for, I think, DATE. I would hope that many of the NORP who have come and been fine contributors here in GPE think about going home to help this young country get on its feet after unspeakable violence and terrible times. You have got a great President, in my judgment. I gave her the National Medal of Freedom. After all, she is the first woman President on the continent of Africa. And she-you know, in my speech DATE, I said, Africa's greatest resource is not oils or diamonds or rubber, it is really people. And so, my hope, of course, is that people that have been here trying to save themselves from the violence go help this young-not young, but this country get back on its feet. What kind of name is that, ENTITY? The situation in GPE has always been a matter of great concern for you. ORG officials say that the situation on the ground has been worsening over DATE. Do you think there is a link between the CARDINAL, between GPE and GPE? And where do we go from there? I appreciate that. I do think there is a link, first of all, and I think that-let me just step back and say that GPE has called the situation in GPE a genocide. And I made a decision early on that we would work through ORG to help expedite troops that would help alleve the suffering and provide some breathing space, hopefully, for the negotiations between rebel groups and the ORG. Unfortunately, the rebel groups that were CARDINAL time CARDINAL are now a multiple of CARDINAL. And unfortunately, a government that could have made a difference early on in GPE chose not to do so. So GPE continues to work with the international community to put pressure on ORG. I have issued very harsh sanctions against individuals and NORP companies. I also did so against CARDINAL rebel leader I am aware of, because I wanted to send a signal that your behavior is causing there to be some consequences. We are continually working with other nations to get them to take the same tough approach-nations throughout the world. In terms of the conditions on the ground, CARDINAL thing GPE has done is, we are providing enormous amounts of aid and obviously are concerned as to whether or not that aid makes it into the camps. Secondly is, I have told the folks at ORG that we would provide training and equipment to expedite the movement of troops. CARDINAL way I can help call the world to action is when I am in GPE to thank the troops of GPE, the PERSON Government, for being so proactive. I am frustrated by the pace of development on the ground. I am not pleased that other nations-some other nations do not take necessary steps to pressure the Government. I am-I have named another Envoy to the GPE, whose job it is to really help bring a negotiating framework that will work. And again, I will repeat to you, one of the unfortunate issues has been that the rebel groups have gone from CARDINAL to CARDINAL, I think it is, or CARDINAL, if I am not mistaken. And there needs to be the GPE and others to pull the groups together so that there is somebody to negotiate with- that can speak with-more likely with a unified voice. And I do believe that the instability in GPE affects GPE and NORP interests. And I do thank ORG for being a responsible nation, rallying ORG forces to come and provide some help. And on the other hand, there are some hopeful moments, such as the fact that many in the world are providing help for the people in the camps. The problem is the people who are in the camps. And obviously, we'd like them to get back to their villages. In your first trip to Africa, you embraced President PERSON as the honest broker in GPE. Well, obviously, we are disappointed that the situation in GPE since my first trip has gotten worse. And it is very important for people to recognize types of government can affect the wellbeing and welfare of a country. GPE used to be a net exporter of food. DATE, it is a net importer of food. PERSON has ruined a country, and we have-we and frankly GPE have been the most vociferous advocates for change, and we still are advocates for change. I was hoping that ORG would have been more proactive in its intercession to help the people of GPE. It is not anti anybody; it is pro people, and that has yet to happen, admittedly. Like they say PERSON - -where I am from? ENTITY, I will recommend you, during your short visit to my country, to have a taste in our juicy, tasty, and nicely perfumed pineapples. And then you will figure out that it will be an opportunity for all the NORP people to have a taste-. Because fruits are not a part of the ORG Administration official. Pineapples can be imported under ORG. So then what we are going to have to do is, I am going to have to talk to your President and point out the opportunities that pineapples are a part of the ORG trade list that can enter into GPE relatively duty free. Yes, but apart from the pineapple, we have so many things and so many products that can profit from the ORG but do not-- You need some export credit-I mean, not export credit, you need some help in developing industries that know how to export. Yes, I will be glad to talk to the President about that. Some grant money that encourages people to learn how to be an exporting company, microloans can also help. And so can ORG, which is a way for people to get the capital necessary to be able to develop an infrastructure so that they can take the pineapple from the field, do whatever you are supposed to do, put it in a crate and ship it to GPE for sale-if you know how to market. In other words, this is a-and so yes, we'd like to help enterprise. The whole purpose of our strategy, which is commerce, is much more effective than aid to governments. It is got a more lasting impact. And CARDINAL of the things I am going to do in GPE is visit entrepreneurs that are taking advantage of marketplace access. That is fine; you are talking about nice things. And we like ORG, but you have got to do something about your agriculture, because it provides a distinct disadvantage for our farmers. And my answer is going to be, we are more than willing to do so, but we expect other partners in the world to do the same thing. And this is a tough issue to get all countries to agree to have equity when it comes to reducing our respective subsidies and tariffs, including NORP nations. CARDINAL of the things I point up to NORP leaders-point out to NORP leaders is that oftentimes it is virtually impossible to ship goods from CARDINAL NORP country to the next because there are high intra-Africa tariffs and barriers to trade. And so it is a-trade is complicated, and we just want to be treated fairly in GPE. In order to get something passed, it has to be viewed as a fair and equitable transaction, and I believe we can achieve such a thing. I am looking forward to that pineapple. ENTITY, your Government has been supporting GPE address the issue of corruption as well as good governance through the ORG initiative and through ORG. And it is now been eligible to receive the funds, but what is going to happen once you step down to make sure what is being done-to make sure that it is going to be sustainable-- it will not end with you. There will be a peaceful transfer of power. And yet I am hopeful that we leave behind an institution such as ORG, which has a monitoring device that will more likely assure the people of GPE that DATE's anticorruption measures are for real and lasting. I mean, you know, DATE's concern about corruption may not be DATE's. I suspect any NORP President is going to be worried about corruption, particularly since we have changed how aid is granted in the first place. And so the fact that the Millennium Challenge exists will make it more likely future administrations will ask the very same questions we have asked. Your thing turned off there, by the way, PERSON. ENTITY, you will see when you visit GPE that DATE, after the genocide, GPE has incredibly developed. But for development in GPE, CARDINAL of the things that are key-that is key is security. And when you started your first mandate, there was already a threat, and DATE, the threat is still there, ENTITY. What do you forecast for the future? FDLR. And which are even listed as terrorist organizations, even by the GPE We are working with President PERSON on a disarmament program. We have been very engaged diplomatically in the eastern part of the GPE. I have talked to him about this personally. Our diplomats out of ORG and on the ground are very actively engaged in getting people to honor the agreement. And I fully understand the issue and the concerns. First of all, the amazing thing is, is that the recovery of your country. President PERSON has been a very strong leader in the right sense of the word. I think I said GPE is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, if I am not mistaken. Now, obviously, that is really good news, and, of course, one of the things that is going to matter is that the people benefit from that economic vitality and growth. But you are right, it is one of the ongoing issues that I talked about in my speech DATE, and the reason I did so, is I wanted the President and the people of GPE to know that we understand the seriousness of this issue; that nobody wants a replay of a very difficult-very terrible period in your history. Yes, ENTITY, your planned visit to Africa shows that the continent has become important to you and your country. Well, that is why the administration has set up ORG for development but not for war-- War, war fighting, and then the ORG, Millennium Challenge Account, all for development-but to the ordinary NORP, he or she can see these things clearly or feel the impact well, maybe because of the gravity of the situation or poverty. And CARDINAL way you made mention of it is to trade, not just aid. But we have problem with the NORP culture produced cotton and all that, because of the subsidies here, the effects are depressed prices back in Africa. What is official-what are you doing to solve this problem of subsidies? First of all, if you are a mother who is worried about a child dying of malaria, and you see a net provided by an NORP child, then all of a sudden, the-you get a direct connection between the hearts of NORP and your life. So, in other words, you asked me whether-how does the average person sometimes feel the effects of NORP commitment to the continent? And my answer to you-and I will answer the subsidy thing-but my answer to you is, first of all, it is a very important question, because oftentimes, DATE, aid would never make it beyond the palaces. They would kind of end up in a handful of people's pockets. And our program, ORG, is really aimed at focusing on individuals. If you believe every human life has dignity, therefore, your programs ought to reflect that concept. And the way you do that is you make sure that the aid gets to the people. In this case, we are focusing on problems that affect the people most directly. And so, at DATE, I got a-a couple years ago, I got nets given in my name or in PERSON's name to families on the continent of Africa. I will never know who they were, and they probably do not know who I am, but the idea that an NORP family decided to spend money on a DATE gift aimed at helping a stranger is really an important part of an effective foreign aid policy. Secondly, our AIDS initiative works very closely with the leaders to design programs that meet the needs of the country-not meet our needs but meet your needs. But the other thing that comes with the AIDS program is a great outpouring of faith-based groups from GPE. There are CARDINAL of my citizens, ENTITY, that would-that long to spend time in parts of Africa delivering help to a total stranger. Other countries-I am sure that happens, but I happen to say that this is the greatest strength of GPE. And so there will be, hopefully, somebody in a village in GPE that runs into CARDINAL of these missionaries on a mission of love, that will see the direct help of an AIDS program or a malaria program and education benefits. It may not be that somebody recognizes that a teacher has been trained by GPE dollars, but our policy is to-we are more focused on the person learning. Maybe there will be a benefit to GPE, a direct benefit, where somebody says, wow, this is great; GPE did this. On the other hand, our focus is more on making sure that the child learns to read in the first place, because our overall objective is a hopeful society and a peaceful society. To subsidies, I fully understand the angst about the leadership-by the leadership on GPE subsidies. And I have said I am more than willing to-on the GPE round-by the most effective place-first of all, ORG has helped address that to a certain extent. On the other hand, it has not made your farmers feel more comfortable because of the-in their view, that the GPE farming is not only efficient, but there is a subsidy to make it even more competitive. I understand that. In other words, the GPE farmer is willing to take less of a subsidy if his-can be assured that his product will get a fair hearing in somebody else's market-particularly those that can afford to buy crops on a large scale-and that is not the case. Same thing if we reduce our subsidies on agriculture; we expect other nations to be more opening to manufactured goods and services. And it is a very complex issue, but it is one that we are trying to work through. And hopefully, if we can get a successful GPE round, your very question will be answered in a way that is hopeful to the farmers there in GPE. I know I am not supposed to be asking questions, but-. Some part of my education was in GPE. I am living in GPE right now. This is off the record, right? road construction work, so you can have a safe-- Well, you do not need to worry about me. We are rushing up everything so you can-- You are building things because of my arrival? We have got infrastructure-- Can you see it, a big difference? Those on the ground are feeling safer. But, like, for NORP here in GPE-I have been talking to most of them- for them to go back home and join in this young democracy. And some of the things they have been saying is the security. And some of them went back, after the first bout of war and were forced to come back. Now they keep saying security, and each time, I say, we have the ORG mission down there. But right now the ORG mission is gradually drawing down faces. Now, will your Government consider establishing ORG in GPE, which would consolidate security there? You know, like a couple of the subregions bring in investment into GPE, which is what mostly GPE needs right now. First of all, ORG is a brand new concept aimed at strengthening nations' capacities to deal with trafficking or terror, but also to help nations develop forces capable of doing the peacekeeping that unfortunately too often is needed on the continent. Secondly, we are in the process of evaluating exactly how ORG will work. Now, because it is a new concept, it was a brand new military-type command-and, by the way, it is going to be more than just military; there will be a ORG component with it, which makes it a very interesting issue. And so we are in the process of determining where and how ORG should be situated on the continent. I am not avoiding-I guess I am avoiding your answer, but I do not mean to be avoiding it. I am just telling you exactly where we are in the process. And obviously, if there is going to be a physical presence on the continent of Africa in the forms of a headquarters that you just described, obviously, we would seriously consider GPE. The President has made it abundantly clear to me that she would like us to seriously consider GPE, and I have told her I would. I just want to make sure people understand that the makeup and the construct of ORG is still really being thought through, because, as I mentioned to you, this is not-I mean, when you think of, you know, GPE command structures, you think military, which is fine. But this is a different military mission than ORG, for example. And as I told you, there is going to be a strong ORG component with it, and we are in the process of making sure we understand what that integration means and then evaluating if and where the facilities will be built. It is on my radar screen. Who won this election? And what should be done to stop this violence? I do not think we can say we are certain to who won the election. That is part of the problem. Secondly, there is a way forward, which is for the parties to come together in good faith and work out a way forward until there are new elections, the date of which would be determined by the parties. I do not think GPE ought to go in, or anybody else, to say, You must have an election now. But I do think we can go in and help PERSON convince the parties to work together in a cooperative way so that the people can see there is a way forward. And to this end, when I am in GPE, I am going to ask PERSON to go over to GPE and sit down with the leaders in GPE to see if we cannot help PERSON advance the-PERSON advance the way forward. CARDINAL of the GPE counterterrorism efforts in Africa has centered on the Horn. Any concern about the continuing instability in GPE and, again, worsening relations between GPE and GPE, the impact that that has not only on stability on the Horn but counterterrorism efforts? Yes, we are concerned about instability anywhere, really, but instability is what-and confusion and chaos and fear is the conditions under which a group like ORG can thrive. That is why they like to kill people, innocent people, to create doubt about existing security, to create fear among the population. So any time you see that kind of instability, we are deeply concerned about it. Secondly, there have been ORG some ORG operating out of GPE, and therefore, when you know ORG have been in and out of GPE and there is some chaos and confusion, the conclusion is, we better be worried about it and do something about it. We have got cooperative arrangements in the region that will make it more likely for us to be able to provide protections for the people in the region and ourself. In terms of-yes, and we are also conscious of GPE and GPE's border dispute. And I am constantly talking to PERSON about making sure that we are on top of the situation as the best we can make a positive contribution. I feel pretty comfortable that ORG and our ORG are fully aware of the issues on the border and are making sure that the respective leaders understand the position of the GPE, which is to solve this thing through mediation and not stack up the troops to the point where they get-where some spark ignites some kind of border dispute. But the Horn is an area of deep concern for the GPE We actually happen to have a base there as well, in GPE. And we take the issues there seriously and are very engaged with it on a regular basis.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignradiojournalists", "title": "Interview With Foreign Radio Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-radio-journalists", "publication_date": "14-02-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 13, "text": "I am very much looking forward to the trip. This will be my second trip to the continent of Africa, my wife's fifth trip. The reason why I am looking forward to it is I want the people on the continent of Africa to know that the NORP people care deeply about the human condition; that when we see suffering, it troubles our conscience, and we want to help. I believe to whom much is given, much is required. A lot has been given to GPE, and therefore, a lot is required of us to deal with human misery in the form of hunger and disease and hopelessness. And so this is going to be a trip that I bring the good will of NORP people, with a strategy to help nations deal with the problems they have. I appreciate the leadership on the continent of Africa, and I am looking forward to working with the leaders there as partners in solving some of the problems that I believe can be solved. I'd be glad to answer questions. I am ENTITY from GPE. Well, people from my country are very delighted to welcome you on DATE. And I wish to say what they are expecting from you and from GPE. You, President PERSON, have said that the best way we can build a peaceful world for the future is to share the principle of freedom with other nations. I took this from the ORG site-this is a word I appreciate. But we highly appreciate how your Government fight poverty and encourage growth building. But we would like all this take place in a perfectly democratic context. Democracy is a commitment by government and by people. The people of GPE have committed to democracy. In my country, we are a great democracy. After all, we enslaved people. And democracy is work and requires a lot of work. And it requires support from-to help leaders deal with everyday problems. CARDINAL such problem in GPE is malaria. Your President has made a strong commitment to help eradicate malaria. DATE, in a speech that inaugurated my trip-or kicked off my trip, I talked about your President's commitment to provide nets to every child DATE and under. These are significant aid programs, but they are given to countries that adhere to rule of law and fight corruption and invest in the health and education of their people. This is a different type of foreign policy. It is a different type of foreign aid. Foreign aid in the past was just, here, take and spend. This is foreign policy that reinforces the conditions necessary for just and peaceful societies to develop. And so I am looking forward to confirming our desire to help and reinforcing the President's desire to achieve a democracy in which people have got confidence. I am ENTITY from GPE.  He is a good guy, yes, and we are happy to receive the ORG money, which we are about to receive when you come down to GPE. Now my question is that GPE is among CARDINAL countries that have benefited from the GPE initiative on HIV/AIDS, ORG program, as well as the malaria initiative. But being an undeveloped country, while-would expect that to see more assistance in terms of helping poor countries such as GPE develop economically. So I'd like to know, as you are winding your term in office, what commitment has GPE made to ensure that developing countries such as GPE is assisted in terms of trade and development issues and private sector development as well? First of all, just in general, our commitment to the continent of Africa was doubled when I first came into office, and then when I got- started my second term, doubled again. Secondly, I do agree that the most substantive way to help any developing nation is through the development of commerce and wealth as a result of growing industry and businesses, both small and large. And the best way to foster that is through trade. And that is why ORG, passed by my predecessor, reauthorized during my Presidency, is a great source of hope for people on the continent of Africa because they now have a market in which to sell. Exports to GPE from the continent of Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, have tripled. Exports from GPE to sub-Saharan Africa have doubled. In other words, this trade has been good. CARDINAL way to firm up the commitment to make sure that our Nation remains nonprotectionist-in other words, a free-trading nation-is to complete the GPE round. That is a difficult set of negotiations. GPE has made it clear that we will reduce our agricultural subsidies, but in return, we expect other developed nations-and developing-large developing nations-to also reduce their tariffs and subsidies so that I can come to the ORG and say, here is an agreement that is fair for everybody. And so the other thing we can do is- so, our assistance aid, by the way, is help-ing-in some cases helps business. CARDINAL way to do that is through ORG. And I announced DATE a new MONEY of OPIC-type investment funds that will be available for NORP businesses. What is interesting is, capital inflows into Africa now exceed grants, development aid. And that is important because capital inflows means jobs and commerce and hope and small businesses. So our plan is a plan that, hopefully, will sustain the gains that have been made. It is not like a CARDINAL-time shot. It is got structural implications. The other thing is, is that you cannot have a hopeful economy if your people cannot read. And so education is a vital link to providing hope. And we have got a strong education initiative on the continent-and started early in my administration; we are following through on it. We are trying to get, I think, like, CARDINAL textbooks and train CARDINAL teachers and provide scholarships to CARDINAL girls, all aiming to provide a basis by which these investments and these capital flows will actually be able to take hold-and that is an educated workforce, an educated population. You are living in GPE now? And I hope I will be there before you reach, so I can welcome you. You somehow already replied to the question I wanted to ask you, but I can maybe define it a bit more. It is clear that the increase of support of your administration-your CARDINAL mandates-increased a lot. And do not you think the GPE should maybe also develop a higher level political strategy on Africa, that would benefit the GPE and Africa? CARDINAL was, We are feeling terrible for you, here is money, and not much asked in return. You have got resources; we want them. We will exploit them and leave behind something that really does not benefit the people. I know those are extreme cases, but nevertheless, if you really think about the history of supporting Africa, it is CARDINAL way to characterize how things were approached. Some of it had to do with the guilt of colonialism; some of it had to do with just the gluttony of need for raw materials. In either case, it did not work. rule of law, fighting corruption, investment in people through health and education programs, and adherence to the marketplace. Nations that have received Millennium Challenge grants have met a test. What is happening, ENTITY, is that other nations desirous of a Millennium Challenge grant ask, What did you do to get your grant, to other leaders. And so the habits of a just society become an integral part of the receiving of help. We are more than willing to help, but in this case, we are saying the help has got to be to reinforce those decisions by leaders that'll have a long-lasting impact toward a free society. If the people think that the leadership is there to enrich themselves, they will have no trust in government. And so CARDINAL of the criterion for Millennium Challenge is honesty. We want the leadership and government to be honest with the people. And when we first put out-when I first put out this initiative, I was criticized by some. That is just part of the job, evidently. And it was, How dare you insist upon conditions for your aid. Should not we expect good leadership? Should not we have faith in people from a different part of the world demanding the same things that we expect of our Government? The answer is, absolutely we should hold people up to a high standard. Absolutely we should expect leaders to adhere to some basic principle. And absolutely we should trust people to want to live in a free society. And so we changed the policy. Not only did we have a more robust approach to the issues facing NORP than ever before in our Nation's history, by a significant amount, but we have a strategy to do just what you asked. How do we make sure that a free society is lasting, that it is not just a moment-you know, let us just do what old PERSON wants us to do, and then he will go away and then societies can revert back its norm. And so we have-there is a constant evaluation of results based upon high standards. ENTITY, I am impressed by your policy statement on Africa DATE. You were the only people in this room; the rest of them fell asleep back there. But just what I have from the-what I have listened to here now, I am mostly impressed; it is quite encouraging. But I just want to know, what is the motivating factor for the increasing interest in Africa? Well, somebody may say it is the new oil finds or the fight against terrorism or we want to promote democracy. First of all, my passion toward Africa has been sustained throughout DATE. In other words, my speech DATE, if you listened carefully to it, indicated a strategy that was first adopted early in my administration. Now, CARDINAL, conditions of life overseas matters to the security of GPE. In other words, if there is hopelessness, then it is liable that extremists who are recruiting people to create havoc not only in their respective countries or neighborhoods but also in our country-if there is hopelessness, they have a better chance to recruit. So it is in our national security interest, ENTITY, that we deal with the conditions that enable ideologues-the ideologues of hate to recruit. Remember that the ideology that is prevalent, that uses murder as a weapon, cannot recruit in hopeful places. Follow me; my vision is-if you are a female, follow me; my vision is, you have no rights ? Or, If you disagree with my religious interpretations, you will be whipped in the public square. So it is in our national interests. Equally, if not more important, it is in our moral interests that we help people. I firmly believe-as I said earlier, I firmly believe in the admonition that to whom much is given, much is required. I believe that is a principle by which people should make decisions in their individual lives and for the collective conscience of GPE. It is in our moral interest that we help a brother and sister who is dying of AIDS. And by helping that soul, it really helps ourselves. GPE's generosity has been prevalent throughout DATE. And every time GPE reaches out to help a struggling soul, we find that we are a better nation for it. And so my interest and my focus and my insistence upon results on the continent of Africa are based on those CARDINAL premises. The other thing, ENTITY, I will tell you is that I have got a lot of resources-or we have a lot of resources at our disposal. And the idea of an entire generation of people dying because of HIV/AIDS troubled my heart. And I felt like GPE could do something about it. CARDINAL people were receiving antiretroviral drugs when we first started PEPFAR. DATE, CARDINAL people are receiving antiretrovirals in a very short period of time. It is because I could not live with myself if I did not develop an effective strategy and call upon the NORP people to help. And the good news is, the NORP people have responded-$15 billion over CARDINAL. We are now going to double our commitment. The ORG has committed to match the GPE So all of a sudden, the strategy-and most of these strategies, ENTITY, are really based upon-oftentimes when you see human suffering, it is based upon something that affects your heart. And so that is why I have made the decisions I made. Well,ENTITY, I would like to thank you for considering GPE as one of the countries you are going to be visiting this time. And the Government and the people of GPE do appreciate all that you have done for us. Now, ENTITY, DATE, your administration extended by DATE the temporary protective status of CARDINAL of NORP. Now what happens when you leave office? Is your Government considering anything permanent for them, like what most host countries did for NORP refugees, integrating them locally, those who wanted to stay? And those who wanted to go back home, taking them back home? Because this might-it will definitely allow these NORP to continue to contribute to the growth of the economy of the country and also support their families back home. I did extend TPS to NORP here in GPE for, I think, DATE. I would hope that many of the NORP who have come and been fine contributors here in GPE think about going home to help this young country get on its feet after unspeakable violence and terrible times. You have got a great President, in my judgment. I gave her the National Medal of Freedom. After all, she is the first woman President on the continent of Africa. And she-you know, in my speech DATE, I said, Africa's greatest resource is not oils or diamonds or rubber, it is really people. And so, my hope, of course, is that people that have been here trying to save themselves from the violence go help this young-not young, but this country get back on its feet. What kind of name is that, ENTITY? The situation in GPE has always been a matter of great concern for you. ORG officials say that the situation on the ground has been worsening over DATE. Do you think there is a link between the CARDINAL, between GPE and GPE? And where do we go from there? I appreciate that. I do think there is a link, first of all, and I think that-let me just step back and say that GPE has called the situation in GPE a genocide. And I made a decision early on that we would work through ORG to help expedite troops that would help alleve the suffering and provide some breathing space, hopefully, for the negotiations between rebel groups and the ORG. Unfortunately, the rebel groups that were CARDINAL time CARDINAL are now a multiple of CARDINAL. And unfortunately, a government that could have made a difference early on in GPE chose not to do so. So GPE continues to work with the international community to put pressure on ORG. I have issued very harsh sanctions against individuals and NORP companies. I also did so against CARDINAL rebel leader I am aware of, because I wanted to send a signal that your behavior is causing there to be some consequences. We are continually working with other nations to get them to take the same tough approach-nations throughout the world. In terms of the conditions on the ground, CARDINAL thing GPE has done is, we are providing enormous amounts of aid and obviously are concerned as to whether or not that aid makes it into the camps. Secondly is, I have told the folks at ORG that we would provide training and equipment to expedite the movement of troops. CARDINAL way I can help call the world to action is when I am in GPE to thank the troops of GPE, the PERSON Government, for being so proactive. I am frustrated by the pace of development on the ground. I am not pleased that other nations-some other nations do not take necessary steps to pressure the Government. I am-I have named another Envoy to the GPE, whose job it is to really help bring a negotiating framework that will work. And again, I will repeat to you, one of the unfortunate issues has been that the rebel groups have gone from CARDINAL to CARDINAL, I think it is, or CARDINAL, if I am not mistaken. And there needs to be the GPE and others to pull the groups together so that there is somebody to negotiate with- that can speak with-more likely with a unified voice. And I do believe that the instability in GPE affects GPE and NORP interests. And I do thank ORG for being a responsible nation, rallying ORG forces to come and provide some help. And on the other hand, there are some hopeful moments, such as the fact that many in the world are providing help for the people in the camps. The problem is the people who are in the camps. And obviously, we'd like them to get back to their villages. In your first trip to Africa, you embraced President PERSON as the honest broker in GPE. Well, obviously, we are disappointed that the situation in GPE since my first trip has gotten worse. And it is very important for people to recognize types of government can affect the wellbeing and welfare of a country. GPE used to be a net exporter of food. DATE, it is a net importer of food. PERSON has ruined a country, and we have-we and frankly GPE have been the most vociferous advocates for change, and we still are advocates for change. I was hoping that ORG would have been more proactive in its intercession to help the people of GPE. It is not anti anybody; it is pro people, and that has yet to happen, admittedly. Like they say PERSON - -where I am from? ENTITY, I will recommend you, during your short visit to my country, to have a taste in our juicy, tasty, and nicely perfumed pineapples. And then you will figure out that it will be an opportunity for all the NORP people to have a taste-. Because fruits are not a part of the ORG Administration official. Pineapples can be imported under ORG. So then what we are going to have to do is, I am going to have to talk to your President and point out the opportunities that pineapples are a part of the ORG trade list that can enter into GPE relatively duty free. Yes, but apart from the pineapple, we have so many things and so many products that can profit from the ORG but do not-- You need some export credit-I mean, not export credit, you need some help in developing industries that know how to export. Yes, I will be glad to talk to the President about that. Some grant money that encourages people to learn how to be an exporting company, microloans can also help. And so can ORG, which is a way for people to get the capital necessary to be able to develop an infrastructure so that they can take the pineapple from the field, do whatever you are supposed to do, put it in a crate and ship it to GPE for sale-if you know how to market. In other words, this is a-and so yes, we'd like to help enterprise. The whole purpose of our strategy, which is commerce, is much more effective than aid to governments. It is got a more lasting impact. And CARDINAL of the things I am going to do in GPE is visit entrepreneurs that are taking advantage of marketplace access. That is fine; you are talking about nice things. And we like ORG, but you have got to do something about your agriculture, because it provides a distinct disadvantage for our farmers. And my answer is going to be, we are more than willing to do so, but we expect other partners in the world to do the same thing. And this is a tough issue to get all countries to agree to have equity when it comes to reducing our respective subsidies and tariffs, including NORP nations. CARDINAL of the things I point up to NORP leaders-point out to NORP leaders is that oftentimes it is virtually impossible to ship goods from CARDINAL NORP country to the next because there are high intra-Africa tariffs and barriers to trade. And so it is a-trade is complicated, and we just want to be treated fairly in GPE. In order to get something passed, it has to be viewed as a fair and equitable transaction, and I believe we can achieve such a thing. I am looking forward to that pineapple. ENTITY, your Government has been supporting GPE address the issue of corruption as well as good governance through the ORG initiative and through ORG. And it is now been eligible to receive the funds, but what is going to happen once you step down to make sure what is being done-to make sure that it is going to be sustainable-- it will not end with you. There will be a peaceful transfer of power. And yet I am hopeful that we leave behind an institution such as ORG, which has a monitoring device that will more likely assure the people of GPE that DATE's anticorruption measures are for real and lasting. I mean, you know, DATE's concern about corruption may not be DATE's. I suspect any NORP President is going to be worried about corruption, particularly since we have changed how aid is granted in the first place. And so the fact that the Millennium Challenge exists will make it more likely future administrations will ask the very same questions we have asked. Your thing turned off there, by the way, PERSON. ENTITY, you will see when you visit GPE that DATE, after the genocide, GPE has incredibly developed. But for development in GPE, CARDINAL of the things that are key-that is key is security. And when you started your first mandate, there was already a threat, and DATE, the threat is still there, ENTITY. What do you forecast for the future? FDLR. And which are even listed as terrorist organizations, even by the GPE We are working with President PERSON on a disarmament program. We have been very engaged diplomatically in the eastern part of the GPE. I have talked to him about this personally. Our diplomats out of ORG and on the ground are very actively engaged in getting people to honor the agreement. And I fully understand the issue and the concerns. First of all, the amazing thing is, is that the recovery of your country. President PERSON has been a very strong leader in the right sense of the word. I think I said GPE is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, if I am not mistaken. Now, obviously, that is really good news, and, of course, one of the things that is going to matter is that the people benefit from that economic vitality and growth. But you are right, it is one of the ongoing issues that I talked about in my speech DATE, and the reason I did so, is I wanted the President and the people of GPE to know that we understand the seriousness of this issue; that nobody wants a replay of a very difficult-very terrible period in your history. Yes, ENTITY, your planned visit to Africa shows that the continent has become important to you and your country. Well, that is why the administration has set up ORG for development but not for war-- War, war fighting, and then the ORG, Millennium Challenge Account, all for development-but to the ordinary NORP, he or she can see these things clearly or feel the impact well, maybe because of the gravity of the situation or poverty. And CARDINAL way you made mention of it is to trade, not just aid. But we have problem with the NORP culture produced cotton and all that, because of the subsidies here, the effects are depressed prices back in Africa. What is official-what are you doing to solve this problem of subsidies? First of all, if you are a mother who is worried about a child dying of malaria, and you see a net provided by an NORP child, then all of a sudden, the-you get a direct connection between the hearts of NORP and your life. So, in other words, you asked me whether-how does the average person sometimes feel the effects of NORP commitment to the continent? And my answer to you-and I will answer the subsidy thing-but my answer to you is, first of all, it is a very important question, because oftentimes, DATE, aid would never make it beyond the palaces. They would kind of end up in a handful of people's pockets. And our program, ORG, is really aimed at focusing on individuals. If you believe every human life has dignity, therefore, your programs ought to reflect that concept. And the way you do that is you make sure that the aid gets to the people. In this case, we are focusing on problems that affect the people most directly. And so, at DATE, I got a-a couple years ago, I got nets given in my name or in PERSON's name to families on the continent of Africa. I will never know who they were, and they probably do not know who I am, but the idea that an NORP family decided to spend money on a DATE gift aimed at helping a stranger is really an important part of an effective foreign aid policy. Secondly, our AIDS initiative works very closely with the leaders to design programs that meet the needs of the country-not meet our needs but meet your needs. But the other thing that comes with the AIDS program is a great outpouring of faith-based groups from GPE. There are CARDINAL of my citizens, ENTITY, that would-that long to spend time in parts of Africa delivering help to a total stranger. Other countries-I am sure that happens, but I happen to say that this is the greatest strength of GPE. And so there will be, hopefully, somebody in a village in GPE that runs into CARDINAL of these missionaries on a mission of love, that will see the direct help of an AIDS program or a malaria program and education benefits. It may not be that somebody recognizes that a teacher has been trained by GPE dollars, but our policy is to-we are more focused on the person learning. Maybe there will be a benefit to GPE, a direct benefit, where somebody says, wow, this is great; GPE did this. On the other hand, our focus is more on making sure that the child learns to read in the first place, because our overall objective is a hopeful society and a peaceful society. To subsidies, I fully understand the angst about the leadership-by the leadership on GPE subsidies. And I have said I am more than willing to-on the GPE round-by the most effective place-first of all, ORG has helped address that to a certain extent. On the other hand, it has not made your farmers feel more comfortable because of the-in their view, that the GPE farming is not only efficient, but there is a subsidy to make it even more competitive. I understand that. In other words, the GPE farmer is willing to take less of a subsidy if his-can be assured that his product will get a fair hearing in somebody else's market-particularly those that can afford to buy crops on a large scale-and that is not the case. Same thing if we reduce our subsidies on agriculture; we expect other nations to be more opening to manufactured goods and services. And it is a very complex issue, but it is one that we are trying to work through. And hopefully, if we can get a successful GPE round, your very question will be answered in a way that is hopeful to the farmers there in GPE. I know I am not supposed to be asking questions, but-. Some part of my education was in GPE. I am living in GPE right now. This is off the record, right? road construction work, so you can have a safe-- Well, you do not need to worry about me. We are rushing up everything so you can-- You are building things because of my arrival? We have got infrastructure-- Can you see it, a big difference? Those on the ground are feeling safer. But, like, for NORP here in GPE-I have been talking to most of them- for them to go back home and join in this young democracy. And some of the things they have been saying is the security. And some of them went back, after the first bout of war and were forced to come back. Now they keep saying security, and each time, I say, we have the ORG mission down there. But right now the ORG mission is gradually drawing down faces. Now, will your Government consider establishing ORG in GPE, which would consolidate security there? You know, like a couple of the subregions bring in investment into GPE, which is what mostly GPE needs right now. First of all, ORG is a brand new concept aimed at strengthening nations' capacities to deal with trafficking or terror, but also to help nations develop forces capable of doing the peacekeeping that unfortunately too often is needed on the continent. Secondly, we are in the process of evaluating exactly how ORG will work. Now, because it is a new concept, it was a brand new military-type command-and, by the way, it is going to be more than just military; there will be a ORG component with it, which makes it a very interesting issue. And so we are in the process of determining where and how ORG should be situated on the continent. I am not avoiding-I guess I am avoiding your answer, but I do not mean to be avoiding it. I am just telling you exactly where we are in the process. And obviously, if there is going to be a physical presence on the continent of Africa in the forms of a headquarters that you just described, obviously, we would seriously consider GPE. The President has made it abundantly clear to me that she would like us to seriously consider GPE, and I have told her I would. I just want to make sure people understand that the makeup and the construct of ORG is still really being thought through, because, as I mentioned to you, this is not-I mean, when you think of, you know, GPE command structures, you think military, which is fine. But this is a different military mission than ORG, for example. And as I told you, there is going to be a strong ORG component with it, and we are in the process of making sure we understand what that integration means and then evaluating if and where the facilities will be built. It is on my radar screen. Who won this election? And what should be done to stop this violence? I do not think we can say we are certain to who won the election. That is part of the problem. Secondly, there is a way forward, which is for the parties to come together in good faith and work out a way forward until there are new elections, the date of which would be determined by the parties. I do not think GPE ought to go in, or anybody else, to say, You must have an election now. But I do think we can go in and help PERSON convince the parties to work together in a cooperative way so that the people can see there is a way forward. And to this end, when I am in GPE, I am going to ask PERSON to go over to GPE and sit down with the leaders in GPE to see if we cannot help PERSON advance the-PERSON advance the way forward. CARDINAL of the GPE counterterrorism efforts in Africa has centered on the Horn. Any concern about the continuing instability in GPE and, again, worsening relations between GPE and GPE, the impact that that has not only on stability on the Horn but counterterrorism efforts? Yes, we are concerned about instability anywhere, really, but instability is what-and confusion and chaos and fear is the conditions under which a group like ORG can thrive. That is why they like to kill people, innocent people, to create doubt about existing security, to create fear among the population. So any time you see that kind of instability, we are deeply concerned about it. Secondly, there have been ORG some ORG operating out of GPE, and therefore, when you know ORG have been in and out of GPE and there is some chaos and confusion, the conclusion is, we better be worried about it and do something about it. We have got cooperative arrangements in the region that will make it more likely for us to be able to provide protections for the people in the region and ourself. In terms of-yes, and we are also conscious of GPE and GPE's border dispute. And I am constantly talking to PERSON about making sure that we are on top of the situation as the best we can make a positive contribution. I feel pretty comfortable that ORG and our ORG are fully aware of the issues on the border and are making sure that the respective leaders understand the position of the GPE, which is to solve this thing through mediation and not stack up the troops to the point where they get-where some spark ignites some kind of border dispute. But the Horn is an area of deep concern for the GPE We actually happen to have a base there as well, in GPE. And we take the issues there seriously and are very engaged with it on a regular basis.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignradiojournalists", "title": "Interview With Foreign Radio Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-radio-journalists", "publication_date": "14-02-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 13, "text": "I am very much looking forward to the trip. This will be my second trip to the continent of Africa, my wife's fifth trip. The reason why I am looking forward to it is I want the people on the continent of Africa to know that the NORP people care deeply about the human condition; that when we see suffering, it troubles our conscience, and we want to help. I believe to whom much is given, much is required. A lot has been given to GPE, and therefore, a lot is required of us to deal with human misery in the form of hunger and disease and hopelessness. And so this is going to be a trip that I bring the good will of NORP people, with a strategy to help nations deal with the problems they have. I appreciate the leadership on the continent of Africa, and I am looking forward to working with the leaders there as partners in solving some of the problems that I believe can be solved. I'd be glad to answer questions. I am ENTITY from GPE. Well, people from my country are very delighted to welcome you on DATE. And I wish to say what they are expecting from you and from GPE. You, President PERSON, have said that the best way we can build a peaceful world for the future is to share the principle of freedom with other nations. I took this from the ORG site-this is a word I appreciate. But we highly appreciate how your Government fight poverty and encourage growth building. But we would like all this take place in a perfectly democratic context. Democracy is a commitment by government and by people. The people of GPE have committed to democracy. In my country, we are a great democracy. After all, we enslaved people. And democracy is work and requires a lot of work. And it requires support from-to help leaders deal with everyday problems. CARDINAL such problem in GPE is malaria. Your President has made a strong commitment to help eradicate malaria. DATE, in a speech that inaugurated my trip-or kicked off my trip, I talked about your President's commitment to provide nets to every child DATE and under. These are significant aid programs, but they are given to countries that adhere to rule of law and fight corruption and invest in the health and education of their people. This is a different type of foreign policy. It is a different type of foreign aid. Foreign aid in the past was just, here, take and spend. This is foreign policy that reinforces the conditions necessary for just and peaceful societies to develop. And so I am looking forward to confirming our desire to help and reinforcing the President's desire to achieve a democracy in which people have got confidence. I am ENTITY from GPE.  He is a good guy, yes, and we are happy to receive the ORG money, which we are about to receive when you come down to GPE. Now my question is that GPE is among CARDINAL countries that have benefited from the GPE initiative on HIV/AIDS, ORG program, as well as the malaria initiative. But being an undeveloped country, while-would expect that to see more assistance in terms of helping poor countries such as GPE develop economically. So I'd like to know, as you are winding your term in office, what commitment has GPE made to ensure that developing countries such as GPE is assisted in terms of trade and development issues and private sector development as well? First of all, just in general, our commitment to the continent of Africa was doubled when I first came into office, and then when I got- started my second term, doubled again. Secondly, I do agree that the most substantive way to help any developing nation is through the development of commerce and wealth as a result of growing industry and businesses, both small and large. And the best way to foster that is through trade. And that is why ORG, passed by my predecessor, reauthorized during my Presidency, is a great source of hope for people on the continent of Africa because they now have a market in which to sell. Exports to GPE from the continent of Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, have tripled. Exports from GPE to sub-Saharan Africa have doubled. In other words, this trade has been good. CARDINAL way to firm up the commitment to make sure that our Nation remains nonprotectionist-in other words, a free-trading nation-is to complete the GPE round. That is a difficult set of negotiations. GPE has made it clear that we will reduce our agricultural subsidies, but in return, we expect other developed nations-and developing-large developing nations-to also reduce their tariffs and subsidies so that I can come to the ORG and say, here is an agreement that is fair for everybody. And so the other thing we can do is- so, our assistance aid, by the way, is help-ing-in some cases helps business. CARDINAL way to do that is through ORG. And I announced DATE a new MONEY of OPIC-type investment funds that will be available for NORP businesses. What is interesting is, capital inflows into Africa now exceed grants, development aid. And that is important because capital inflows means jobs and commerce and hope and small businesses. So our plan is a plan that, hopefully, will sustain the gains that have been made. It is not like a CARDINAL-time shot. It is got structural implications. The other thing is, is that you cannot have a hopeful economy if your people cannot read. And so education is a vital link to providing hope. And we have got a strong education initiative on the continent-and started early in my administration; we are following through on it. We are trying to get, I think, like, CARDINAL textbooks and train CARDINAL teachers and provide scholarships to CARDINAL girls, all aiming to provide a basis by which these investments and these capital flows will actually be able to take hold-and that is an educated workforce, an educated population. You are living in GPE now? And I hope I will be there before you reach, so I can welcome you. You somehow already replied to the question I wanted to ask you, but I can maybe define it a bit more. It is clear that the increase of support of your administration-your CARDINAL mandates-increased a lot. And do not you think the GPE should maybe also develop a higher level political strategy on Africa, that would benefit the GPE and Africa? CARDINAL was, We are feeling terrible for you, here is money, and not much asked in return. You have got resources; we want them. We will exploit them and leave behind something that really does not benefit the people. I know those are extreme cases, but nevertheless, if you really think about the history of supporting Africa, it is CARDINAL way to characterize how things were approached. Some of it had to do with the guilt of colonialism; some of it had to do with just the gluttony of need for raw materials. In either case, it did not work. rule of law, fighting corruption, investment in people through health and education programs, and adherence to the marketplace. Nations that have received Millennium Challenge grants have met a test. What is happening, ENTITY, is that other nations desirous of a Millennium Challenge grant ask, What did you do to get your grant, to other leaders. And so the habits of a just society become an integral part of the receiving of help. We are more than willing to help, but in this case, we are saying the help has got to be to reinforce those decisions by leaders that'll have a long-lasting impact toward a free society. If the people think that the leadership is there to enrich themselves, they will have no trust in government. And so CARDINAL of the criterion for Millennium Challenge is honesty. We want the leadership and government to be honest with the people. And when we first put out-when I first put out this initiative, I was criticized by some. That is just part of the job, evidently. And it was, How dare you insist upon conditions for your aid. Should not we expect good leadership? Should not we have faith in people from a different part of the world demanding the same things that we expect of our Government? The answer is, absolutely we should hold people up to a high standard. Absolutely we should expect leaders to adhere to some basic principle. And absolutely we should trust people to want to live in a free society. And so we changed the policy. Not only did we have a more robust approach to the issues facing NORP than ever before in our Nation's history, by a significant amount, but we have a strategy to do just what you asked. How do we make sure that a free society is lasting, that it is not just a moment-you know, let us just do what old PERSON wants us to do, and then he will go away and then societies can revert back its norm. And so we have-there is a constant evaluation of results based upon high standards. ENTITY, I am impressed by your policy statement on Africa DATE. You were the only people in this room; the rest of them fell asleep back there. But just what I have from the-what I have listened to here now, I am mostly impressed; it is quite encouraging. But I just want to know, what is the motivating factor for the increasing interest in Africa? Well, somebody may say it is the new oil finds or the fight against terrorism or we want to promote democracy. First of all, my passion toward Africa has been sustained throughout DATE. In other words, my speech DATE, if you listened carefully to it, indicated a strategy that was first adopted early in my administration. Now, CARDINAL, conditions of life overseas matters to the security of GPE. In other words, if there is hopelessness, then it is liable that extremists who are recruiting people to create havoc not only in their respective countries or neighborhoods but also in our country-if there is hopelessness, they have a better chance to recruit. So it is in our national security interest, ENTITY, that we deal with the conditions that enable ideologues-the ideologues of hate to recruit. Remember that the ideology that is prevalent, that uses murder as a weapon, cannot recruit in hopeful places. Follow me; my vision is-if you are a female, follow me; my vision is, you have no rights ? Or, If you disagree with my religious interpretations, you will be whipped in the public square. So it is in our national interests. Equally, if not more important, it is in our moral interests that we help people. I firmly believe-as I said earlier, I firmly believe in the admonition that to whom much is given, much is required. I believe that is a principle by which people should make decisions in their individual lives and for the collective conscience of GPE. It is in our moral interest that we help a brother and sister who is dying of AIDS. And by helping that soul, it really helps ourselves. GPE's generosity has been prevalent throughout DATE. And every time GPE reaches out to help a struggling soul, we find that we are a better nation for it. And so my interest and my focus and my insistence upon results on the continent of Africa are based on those CARDINAL premises. The other thing, ENTITY, I will tell you is that I have got a lot of resources-or we have a lot of resources at our disposal. And the idea of an entire generation of people dying because of HIV/AIDS troubled my heart. And I felt like GPE could do something about it. CARDINAL people were receiving antiretroviral drugs when we first started PEPFAR. DATE, CARDINAL people are receiving antiretrovirals in a very short period of time. It is because I could not live with myself if I did not develop an effective strategy and call upon the NORP people to help. And the good news is, the NORP people have responded-$15 billion over CARDINAL. We are now going to double our commitment. The ORG has committed to match the GPE So all of a sudden, the strategy-and most of these strategies, ENTITY, are really based upon-oftentimes when you see human suffering, it is based upon something that affects your heart. And so that is why I have made the decisions I made. Well,ENTITY, I would like to thank you for considering GPE as one of the countries you are going to be visiting this time. And the Government and the people of GPE do appreciate all that you have done for us. Now, ENTITY, DATE, your administration extended by DATE the temporary protective status of CARDINAL of NORP. Now what happens when you leave office? Is your Government considering anything permanent for them, like what most host countries did for NORP refugees, integrating them locally, those who wanted to stay? And those who wanted to go back home, taking them back home? Because this might-it will definitely allow these NORP to continue to contribute to the growth of the economy of the country and also support their families back home. I did extend TPS to NORP here in GPE for, I think, DATE. I would hope that many of the NORP who have come and been fine contributors here in GPE think about going home to help this young country get on its feet after unspeakable violence and terrible times. You have got a great President, in my judgment. I gave her the National Medal of Freedom. After all, she is the first woman President on the continent of Africa. And she-you know, in my speech DATE, I said, Africa's greatest resource is not oils or diamonds or rubber, it is really people. And so, my hope, of course, is that people that have been here trying to save themselves from the violence go help this young-not young, but this country get back on its feet. What kind of name is that, ENTITY? The situation in GPE has always been a matter of great concern for you. ORG officials say that the situation on the ground has been worsening over DATE. Do you think there is a link between the CARDINAL, between GPE and GPE? And where do we go from there? I appreciate that. I do think there is a link, first of all, and I think that-let me just step back and say that GPE has called the situation in GPE a genocide. And I made a decision early on that we would work through ORG to help expedite troops that would help alleve the suffering and provide some breathing space, hopefully, for the negotiations between rebel groups and the ORG. Unfortunately, the rebel groups that were CARDINAL time CARDINAL are now a multiple of CARDINAL. And unfortunately, a government that could have made a difference early on in GPE chose not to do so. So GPE continues to work with the international community to put pressure on ORG. I have issued very harsh sanctions against individuals and NORP companies. I also did so against CARDINAL rebel leader I am aware of, because I wanted to send a signal that your behavior is causing there to be some consequences. We are continually working with other nations to get them to take the same tough approach-nations throughout the world. In terms of the conditions on the ground, CARDINAL thing GPE has done is, we are providing enormous amounts of aid and obviously are concerned as to whether or not that aid makes it into the camps. Secondly is, I have told the folks at ORG that we would provide training and equipment to expedite the movement of troops. CARDINAL way I can help call the world to action is when I am in GPE to thank the troops of GPE, the PERSON Government, for being so proactive. I am frustrated by the pace of development on the ground. I am not pleased that other nations-some other nations do not take necessary steps to pressure the Government. I am-I have named another Envoy to the GPE, whose job it is to really help bring a negotiating framework that will work. And again, I will repeat to you, one of the unfortunate issues has been that the rebel groups have gone from CARDINAL to CARDINAL, I think it is, or CARDINAL, if I am not mistaken. And there needs to be the GPE and others to pull the groups together so that there is somebody to negotiate with- that can speak with-more likely with a unified voice. And I do believe that the instability in GPE affects GPE and NORP interests. And I do thank ORG for being a responsible nation, rallying ORG forces to come and provide some help. And on the other hand, there are some hopeful moments, such as the fact that many in the world are providing help for the people in the camps. The problem is the people who are in the camps. And obviously, we'd like them to get back to their villages. In your first trip to Africa, you embraced President PERSON as the honest broker in GPE. Well, obviously, we are disappointed that the situation in GPE since my first trip has gotten worse. And it is very important for people to recognize types of government can affect the wellbeing and welfare of a country. GPE used to be a net exporter of food. DATE, it is a net importer of food. PERSON has ruined a country, and we have-we and frankly GPE have been the most vociferous advocates for change, and we still are advocates for change. I was hoping that ORG would have been more proactive in its intercession to help the people of GPE. It is not anti anybody; it is pro people, and that has yet to happen, admittedly. Like they say PERSON - -where I am from? ENTITY, I will recommend you, during your short visit to my country, to have a taste in our juicy, tasty, and nicely perfumed pineapples. And then you will figure out that it will be an opportunity for all the NORP people to have a taste-. Because fruits are not a part of the ORG Administration official. Pineapples can be imported under ORG. So then what we are going to have to do is, I am going to have to talk to your President and point out the opportunities that pineapples are a part of the ORG trade list that can enter into GPE relatively duty free. Yes, but apart from the pineapple, we have so many things and so many products that can profit from the ORG but do not-- You need some export credit-I mean, not export credit, you need some help in developing industries that know how to export. Yes, I will be glad to talk to the President about that. Some grant money that encourages people to learn how to be an exporting company, microloans can also help. And so can ORG, which is a way for people to get the capital necessary to be able to develop an infrastructure so that they can take the pineapple from the field, do whatever you are supposed to do, put it in a crate and ship it to GPE for sale-if you know how to market. In other words, this is a-and so yes, we'd like to help enterprise. The whole purpose of our strategy, which is commerce, is much more effective than aid to governments. It is got a more lasting impact. And CARDINAL of the things I am going to do in GPE is visit entrepreneurs that are taking advantage of marketplace access. That is fine; you are talking about nice things. And we like ORG, but you have got to do something about your agriculture, because it provides a distinct disadvantage for our farmers. And my answer is going to be, we are more than willing to do so, but we expect other partners in the world to do the same thing. And this is a tough issue to get all countries to agree to have equity when it comes to reducing our respective subsidies and tariffs, including NORP nations. CARDINAL of the things I point up to NORP leaders-point out to NORP leaders is that oftentimes it is virtually impossible to ship goods from CARDINAL NORP country to the next because there are high intra-Africa tariffs and barriers to trade. And so it is a-trade is complicated, and we just want to be treated fairly in GPE. In order to get something passed, it has to be viewed as a fair and equitable transaction, and I believe we can achieve such a thing. I am looking forward to that pineapple. ENTITY, your Government has been supporting GPE address the issue of corruption as well as good governance through the ORG initiative and through ORG. And it is now been eligible to receive the funds, but what is going to happen once you step down to make sure what is being done-to make sure that it is going to be sustainable-- it will not end with you. There will be a peaceful transfer of power. And yet I am hopeful that we leave behind an institution such as ORG, which has a monitoring device that will more likely assure the people of GPE that DATE's anticorruption measures are for real and lasting. I mean, you know, DATE's concern about corruption may not be DATE's. I suspect any NORP President is going to be worried about corruption, particularly since we have changed how aid is granted in the first place. And so the fact that the Millennium Challenge exists will make it more likely future administrations will ask the very same questions we have asked. Your thing turned off there, by the way, PERSON. ENTITY, you will see when you visit GPE that DATE, after the genocide, GPE has incredibly developed. But for development in GPE, CARDINAL of the things that are key-that is key is security. And when you started your first mandate, there was already a threat, and DATE, the threat is still there, ENTITY. What do you forecast for the future? FDLR. And which are even listed as terrorist organizations, even by the GPE We are working with President PERSON on a disarmament program. We have been very engaged diplomatically in the eastern part of the GPE. I have talked to him about this personally. Our diplomats out of ORG and on the ground are very actively engaged in getting people to honor the agreement. And I fully understand the issue and the concerns. First of all, the amazing thing is, is that the recovery of your country. President PERSON has been a very strong leader in the right sense of the word. I think I said GPE is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, if I am not mistaken. Now, obviously, that is really good news, and, of course, one of the things that is going to matter is that the people benefit from that economic vitality and growth. But you are right, it is one of the ongoing issues that I talked about in my speech DATE, and the reason I did so, is I wanted the President and the people of GPE to know that we understand the seriousness of this issue; that nobody wants a replay of a very difficult-very terrible period in your history. Yes, ENTITY, your planned visit to Africa shows that the continent has become important to you and your country. Well, that is why the administration has set up ORG for development but not for war-- War, war fighting, and then the ORG, Millennium Challenge Account, all for development-but to the ordinary NORP, he or she can see these things clearly or feel the impact well, maybe because of the gravity of the situation or poverty. And CARDINAL way you made mention of it is to trade, not just aid. But we have problem with the NORP culture produced cotton and all that, because of the subsidies here, the effects are depressed prices back in Africa. What is official-what are you doing to solve this problem of subsidies? First of all, if you are a mother who is worried about a child dying of malaria, and you see a net provided by an NORP child, then all of a sudden, the-you get a direct connection between the hearts of NORP and your life. So, in other words, you asked me whether-how does the average person sometimes feel the effects of NORP commitment to the continent? And my answer to you-and I will answer the subsidy thing-but my answer to you is, first of all, it is a very important question, because oftentimes, DATE, aid would never make it beyond the palaces. They would kind of end up in a handful of people's pockets. And our program, ORG, is really aimed at focusing on individuals. If you believe every human life has dignity, therefore, your programs ought to reflect that concept. And the way you do that is you make sure that the aid gets to the people. In this case, we are focusing on problems that affect the people most directly. And so, at DATE, I got a-a couple years ago, I got nets given in my name or in PERSON's name to families on the continent of Africa. I will never know who they were, and they probably do not know who I am, but the idea that an NORP family decided to spend money on a DATE gift aimed at helping a stranger is really an important part of an effective foreign aid policy. Secondly, our AIDS initiative works very closely with the leaders to design programs that meet the needs of the country-not meet our needs but meet your needs. But the other thing that comes with the AIDS program is a great outpouring of faith-based groups from GPE. There are CARDINAL of my citizens, ENTITY, that would-that long to spend time in parts of Africa delivering help to a total stranger. Other countries-I am sure that happens, but I happen to say that this is the greatest strength of GPE. And so there will be, hopefully, somebody in a village in GPE that runs into CARDINAL of these missionaries on a mission of love, that will see the direct help of an AIDS program or a malaria program and education benefits. It may not be that somebody recognizes that a teacher has been trained by GPE dollars, but our policy is to-we are more focused on the person learning. Maybe there will be a benefit to GPE, a direct benefit, where somebody says, wow, this is great; GPE did this. On the other hand, our focus is more on making sure that the child learns to read in the first place, because our overall objective is a hopeful society and a peaceful society. To subsidies, I fully understand the angst about the leadership-by the leadership on GPE subsidies. And I have said I am more than willing to-on the GPE round-by the most effective place-first of all, ORG has helped address that to a certain extent. On the other hand, it has not made your farmers feel more comfortable because of the-in their view, that the GPE farming is not only efficient, but there is a subsidy to make it even more competitive. I understand that. In other words, the GPE farmer is willing to take less of a subsidy if his-can be assured that his product will get a fair hearing in somebody else's market-particularly those that can afford to buy crops on a large scale-and that is not the case. Same thing if we reduce our subsidies on agriculture; we expect other nations to be more opening to manufactured goods and services. And it is a very complex issue, but it is one that we are trying to work through. And hopefully, if we can get a successful GPE round, your very question will be answered in a way that is hopeful to the farmers there in GPE. I know I am not supposed to be asking questions, but-. Some part of my education was in GPE. I am living in GPE right now. This is off the record, right? road construction work, so you can have a safe-- Well, you do not need to worry about me. We are rushing up everything so you can-- You are building things because of my arrival? We have got infrastructure-- Can you see it, a big difference? Those on the ground are feeling safer. But, like, for NORP here in GPE-I have been talking to most of them- for them to go back home and join in this young democracy. And some of the things they have been saying is the security. And some of them went back, after the first bout of war and were forced to come back. Now they keep saying security, and each time, I say, we have the ORG mission down there. But right now the ORG mission is gradually drawing down faces. Now, will your Government consider establishing ORG in GPE, which would consolidate security there? You know, like a couple of the subregions bring in investment into GPE, which is what mostly GPE needs right now. First of all, ORG is a brand new concept aimed at strengthening nations' capacities to deal with trafficking or terror, but also to help nations develop forces capable of doing the peacekeeping that unfortunately too often is needed on the continent. Secondly, we are in the process of evaluating exactly how ORG will work. Now, because it is a new concept, it was a brand new military-type command-and, by the way, it is going to be more than just military; there will be a ORG component with it, which makes it a very interesting issue. And so we are in the process of determining where and how ORG should be situated on the continent. I am not avoiding-I guess I am avoiding your answer, but I do not mean to be avoiding it. I am just telling you exactly where we are in the process. And obviously, if there is going to be a physical presence on the continent of Africa in the forms of a headquarters that you just described, obviously, we would seriously consider GPE. The President has made it abundantly clear to me that she would like us to seriously consider GPE, and I have told her I would. I just want to make sure people understand that the makeup and the construct of ORG is still really being thought through, because, as I mentioned to you, this is not-I mean, when you think of, you know, GPE command structures, you think military, which is fine. But this is a different military mission than ORG, for example. And as I told you, there is going to be a strong ORG component with it, and we are in the process of making sure we understand what that integration means and then evaluating if and where the facilities will be built. It is on my radar screen. Who won this election? And what should be done to stop this violence? I do not think we can say we are certain to who won the election. That is part of the problem. Secondly, there is a way forward, which is for the parties to come together in good faith and work out a way forward until there are new elections, the date of which would be determined by the parties. I do not think GPE ought to go in, or anybody else, to say, You must have an election now. But I do think we can go in and help PERSON convince the parties to work together in a cooperative way so that the people can see there is a way forward. And to this end, when I am in GPE, I am going to ask PERSON to go over to GPE and sit down with the leaders in GPE to see if we cannot help PERSON advance the-PERSON advance the way forward. CARDINAL of the GPE counterterrorism efforts in Africa has centered on the Horn. Any concern about the continuing instability in GPE and, again, worsening relations between GPE and GPE, the impact that that has not only on stability on the Horn but counterterrorism efforts? Yes, we are concerned about instability anywhere, really, but instability is what-and confusion and chaos and fear is the conditions under which a group like ORG can thrive. That is why they like to kill people, innocent people, to create doubt about existing security, to create fear among the population. So any time you see that kind of instability, we are deeply concerned about it. Secondly, there have been ORG some ORG operating out of GPE, and therefore, when you know ORG have been in and out of GPE and there is some chaos and confusion, the conclusion is, we better be worried about it and do something about it. We have got cooperative arrangements in the region that will make it more likely for us to be able to provide protections for the people in the region and ourself. In terms of-yes, and we are also conscious of GPE and GPE's border dispute. And I am constantly talking to PERSON about making sure that we are on top of the situation as the best we can make a positive contribution. I feel pretty comfortable that ORG and our ORG are fully aware of the issues on the border and are making sure that the respective leaders understand the position of the GPE, which is to solve this thing through mediation and not stack up the troops to the point where they get-where some spark ignites some kind of border dispute. But the Horn is an area of deep concern for the GPE We actually happen to have a base there as well, in GPE. And we take the issues there seriously and are very engaged with it on a regular basis.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignradiojournalists", "title": "Interview With Foreign Radio Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-radio-journalists", "publication_date": "14-02-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 14, "text": "I am in GPE, and one of the reasons I have come is not only to pay my respects to the Government and the people of GPE, but also to be in a position to speak about freedom in GPE. I just had lunch with some people that are deeply concerned about the future of GPE, people that were involved in the student marches of DATE, people involved with humanitarian assistance. I was regretful that my wife could not join us, because she is an articulate spokesman for the people of GPE; but she is on the border on this mission of saying to the NORP people, you have friends, and you are not alone, and GPE cares about you. So I want to thank you for giving me the chance to answer your questions, and I will be glad to do so now. Why do not we just go around the table? PERSON, it is an honor to be with you, and many thanks, giving a chance to-this roundtable discussion. My name is PERSON, from ORG; PERSON from ORG; and PERSON from ORG. We have CARDINAL lady here from ORG, PERSON. I would like to start a couple questions about the relief aid policy of GPE. Recent relief operation, the NORP regime did not allow the ORG ship aid through the Pacific come, and international community, the GPE, obviously, was really frustrated. I would like to know, if GPE faced another catastrophe or disaster, are you going to try to help, or are you going to--NORP regime again? But first of all, we care about the human condition, human suffering. I can remember DATE it hit. I was told that this was going to be a major disaster for the people, and so I ordered our ORG ships in the area to be prepared to sail toward the NORP area to provide aid and logistics and management. We are very good about dealing with major emergencies. And interestingly enough, we were involved with a military mission in the area, so we were prepared to send a robust package in. No telling how many lives could have been saved or how much human suffering could have been dealt with more effectively had there not been the slow response of the military dictator. But now our aid, along with other people-other countries' aid, is beginning to move. In answer to your question, yes, our Government will respond if there is another catastrophe. that there needs to be truthfulness at the highest levels of government. People have got to understand and listen to reality and understand that nations and people want to help when there is suffering. In the meantime, we are going to keep pushing for freedom. During the time, a lot of NORP people, they were expecting a sort of humanitarian intervention, even though the NORP regime did not allow the aid. We chose to go through the normal routes. We wanted to basically say, here is your opportunity to receive aid. But I do not think it would have been helpful for the NORP people had there been a conflict over the delivery of aid. What we do not want to do is compound a terrible situation. In other words, if we just sent in-sent people in, our military in without visas or permission from the Government, there is no telling what the reaction would have been. And so yes, I-no question, there was frustration on the delays, but I felt the best way to do so was the way we ended up doing it. My only point is, is that there is - if there is another catastrophe, and let us pray there is not, but if there is, the Government will now see that they have nothing to fear by welcoming in GPE aid and other countries' aid. They ought to welcome that. And of course, we'd like to help on that too. We spent MONEY, or MONEY of help so far. We care about the stories we hear. And we want the farmers to get seed and fertilizer so they can grow and feed their families and feed the people in their area and, hopefully, grow enough for the country. Now, GPE has proposed civil military relief exercise with the countries in this region, and recent ORG meeting endorsed that relief exercise, and probably DATE the GPE will host. So they agree to cooperate relief exercise. I wonder, if the countries in this region agree to cooperate, are you going to invite this exercise to include NORP military regime or GPE? I have not thought that through yet, to be frank with you. I cannot answer your question, because you are the first person who is asked me that question. I will take it back to GPE and- under consideration. I have no-but I cannot say yes or no right now. How will GPE try to overcome this impasse, most recently seen at ORG over GPE? Well, what we have got to do is continue to work with countries on ORG and explain to them that what matters most in life is the human condition and that individual rights are important. And we just have a lot of work to do to convince people that the status quo in GPE-that life can be better, let me put it that way. And it is in their interest that life is better, particularly GPE. GPE is an important country on ORG; they are an important country in the world, obviously, GPE's neighbor. And we-I hope that I can use my good relations with the NORP leadership to convince them that the way forward is for there to be more civic participation, more citizen participation in the future of the country, and that the perfect way to do that is to explain to them how backward the Government was when it came to the response for the natural disaster. Hopefully, that will open up eyes. But no question, there is a lot of diplomacy that needs to be done to convince others that people like PERSON deserve to be free and political prisoners ought to be free. And the reason I am talking to you DATE is because I want those in prison and their families to know that we care about them and think about them. I mean, it is in the common ground, for example, that the NORP be a peaceful country. I mean, we care about that. Whether or not the NORP will agree that somebody like PERSON ought to be free and ought to be the center of foreign policy like it is for us, I do not know. We just have to work it hard.  you will be meeting the highest NORP leadership DATE. And you said you would mention GPE to those leaders. You have not been able to convince them until now. How optimistic are you that you will be able to convince, and how are you going to go about doing this time, sir? Well, you know, look, it is -I have mentioned GPE a lot to the NORP leadership, and it is -I have mentioned GPE; I have mentioned GPE; I have mentioned religious freedom inside GPE. And it is just a matter of continuing to make the case. I have-I am sure the NORP leader's mind is going to be on the Olympics. This is a big deal for the people of GPE. CARDINAL of the reasons I am going is to be able to pay my respects to the people of GPE, and well as to be in a position where I can bring up these issues with the NORP Government. I am just-it is -to me, this is a process of continually having a consistent message, speaking to the people of GPE, letting the prisoners know we care about them, and pressing hard at the international level. I make no promises to your listeners except that we will continue to try. CARDINAL thing is the relationship with the regime. Then you have been probably the President who is more committed for the NORP democratic movement. But the GPE tough line against GPE sometimes entrenched the generals there, and some people would say that given the example of the Nargis Cyclone relief efforts, then if you have had this kind of relationship with the generals then you could be able to do more. I understand your point. We have been tough, because we believe that the general has been very stubborn in not allowing certain freedoms, and we believe that is wrong. We believe that those arrested in the marches of DATE ought to be released from prison. There is CARDINAL political prisoners who are being held simply because they had a belief that was contrary to what the general thinks. You notice I am saying general because it is generally viewed as a CARDINAL-man regime. I know there is others that support him. But yes, I have been and-because I believe that-as a matter of fact, just signed a bill that is going to continue the sanction regime, particularly when it comes to jade and precious gems. That is an interesting question, had we had a different relationship, CARDINAL, what would it say to the reformers, but also, would it have changed the number of DATE required to let relief in? What I am concerned about is the general was not being given full information, that he was not fully aware of reality. And I do not think his reaction was because of relations with GPE; I think his reaction was-is because he was in denial to a certain extent about the realities on the ground. But I am constantly-look, my mission, so long as I am the President, which is DATE, is to think about ways to relieve human suffering and how to help people inside GPE. And if I thought it would make-help us achieve the objective by changing the relationship with the Government, I'd give it serious consideration. But I do not necessarily agree with that premise. On the other hand, the people that are listening to your radio broadcast has got to know that the President of GPE and a lot of other people in GPE are concerned and care about how they live and want them to be free and want them to realize the beauties of a NORP-style democracy. Nevertheless, what is important, though, if for there to be a strong voice in laying out that vision. And that is what I will continue to do. you just met a group of NORP activists and then you share views with them on GPE's struggle. What do you see and what do you get from having lunch with them? First of all, there is a lot of courageous people that have made a decision to work hard on behalf of the rest of their citizens to achieve a free society. Secondly, that they have great hopes that GPE will continue to speak out, that GPE will not abandon our belief in the universality of freedom. Thirdly, they were-I asked-I said, if you were me, what would you do? And I got a variety of opinions. And it was fascinating to hear voices of people who have actually been on the frontlines of change. I came away with the impression that they are very grateful to the NORP people for the generous support. Sometimes our generosity is not-actually ends up in the hands of the people as quickly as it should, but nevertheless, that they are- there seems to be a general awareness that the NORP people care. There are people who may even be wearing the military uniform who understand that the status quo is not acceptable, and there needs to be a better way forward. But a lot of the frustration was focused on a single person, the general in charge of the country, and that-there was a belief that he did not seem to care that much about the plight of the average citizen. And so hopefully, GPE pressure and GPE focus will get him to think more about the average person and care about the way the average person lives. Many critics said that our opposition itself is also very much divided and they are not united enough against the military regime and that-do you think that GPE can help prepare them for their future democratic GPE? Well, first of all-that was an interesting question-I did not think they were very divided, at least the crowd I was with. But I thought they were pretty united in their dream for a better GPE. You know, CARDINAL of the things that, obviously, the people involved in the democracy movement have got to think through is how do you get from here to there. In other words, it is not easy to go from a very fierce military CARDINAL-man rule to democracy. And you have a very good point, and that is, is that there is a-is there a focused roadmap to get to a better DATE? It is hard for me to tell just in that conversation. Obviously, that is going to be a concern for-it must be a concern for people. The rewrite of the Constitution is just a-it is not a good document; it is not a fair document. So therefore, there needs to be a constitution at some point in time that will enable GPE to be a Federal state that-based upon the will of the people. The military regime will hold a election in DATE, and they began preparing DATE for election. And then what is GPE stand on this election? I think the Constitution is a sham constitution, and therefore-but, you know, I-this is a society that is not interested in democracy. They have proved they are not interested in democracy. If they are interested in democracy, they'd let the prisoners out of prison, for starters. The political prisoners would be a-given to chance to leave and live in a free life. That is the first test, not election under a sham constitution. And so, you know, they will play like the election was fair and all this-to justify their behavior. And I think people like yourself ought to be speaking out that the elections, unless certain conditions are met, cannot possibly be fair. We understand and the NORP listeners also understand how you and the First Lady are compassionate for NORP people, how much you strongly support to the freedom for GPE.  I know both candidates and the-freedom for GPE is a bipartisan issue. And the NORP people-it is not just the President that thinks about the citizens of GPE. There is a lot of people in our ORG, both NORP and NORP, that feel the same way. And so I think the NORP people are going to have a consistent friend in GPE. You are talking to the GPE authorities. Do you think GPE can play a role to make situation better in GPE? I think-oh, yes, I think GPE could play a different role. And so I will -I will bring up the GPE-Burmese issue again to President PERSON, who I like. And they just got different interests, at times, from GPE. And so I have got to work hard to see if I cannot convince him that we share the same goals. Wonder will GPE and ORG in Southeast Asia-- They need to send a signal. Obviously, GPE was very helpful when it came to helping with the cyclone- aftermath of the cyclone. After all, this is a staging center for a lot of our materials and other peoples'-countries' materials that came through. Yes, and they can continue to work the issue. We just got to make sure that ORG delivers a message that is inspiring to the people of GPE. President, besides sanction and travel restrictions on the generals in GPE, do you-have you ever thought of alternative strategies work on GPE-under GPE and then with the international community? And if your question is, do I-am I trying to convince others to join us on the strategy? In other words, it would be better if we could all speak with one voice. And I have been in-you know, it had not been that hard with some countries, like the NORP countries, for example. But it is been difficult with some of the countries in the neighborhood here because we do not share the same goals. Their goal is stability and-at times. And that is not necessarily the-I am for stability too. But I'd like to see the system move toward a free society. I have got a friend who helps deal with the rape victims along the border. These women are being raped- she says, systemically raped by the military as part of their campaign of fear. That stuff has got to end in order for me to feel comfortable with any other policy toward GPE. In other words, there is -and others have different priorities. And so therefore, it is hard to find common ground, but we will continue to try to do so. Then I got to go to the games. I am cheering the NORP Olympic team. You have the conviction and idea to bring freedom and democracy to GPE, but some people would say that GPE does not have much strategic interest in GPE, unlike GPE. I think so long as there is human suffering like there is here in GPE, then this will be of strategic importance to GPE. Look, no question, we have got a lot of issues on our platter, but I think about GPE a lot. Maybe CARDINAL reason why is my wife was such a activist on the subject. But nevertheless, I gave a speech DATE in GPE that talked about how GPE is, in many ways, a Pacific nation, and that I think-I know the center of gravity of a lot of policy is shifting to the Far East. And therefore, GPE-the NORP issue is-will be an integral part of any NORP policy. And no question, GPE's strategic interests lie in a lot of places, but they lie here as well. And so long as this issue festers, then it will have the attention of the NORP policymakers.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignradiojournalistsbangkok", "title": "Interview With Foreign Radio Journalists in Bangkok", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-radio-journalists-bangkok", "publication_date": "07-08-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.
