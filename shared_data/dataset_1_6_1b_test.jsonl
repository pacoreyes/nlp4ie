We have 11 million trucks come across our borders. We have 51,000 foreign ships call into our ports. It reminds us that no nation can be totally secure or more secure, unless we are well-protected and unless our borders are well-screened. We must know who is coming into our country and why they are coming. We must know what our visitors are doing and when they leave. And we must always protect the rights of our law of law-abiding citizens from around the world who come here to conduct business or to study or to spend time with their family. That is what we are known for. We are known for respect. But on the other hand, we can do a better job of making our borders more secure and make our borders smart. We must use technology and be wise about how we use technology, to speed the flow of commerce across our borders and to identify frequent travelers who pose no risk. We should be directing resources to risk. We ought to be routing out smugglers and focusing on criminals and, of course, stopping terrorists from coming into the country. The bill I sign today enhances our ongoing efforts to strengthen our borders. The purpose of this bill is to help our country do a better job of border security. It authorizes 400 additional inspectors, investigators, and other staff on the INS over the next 5 years. We are adding manpower, obviously. It makes it easier for the INS and other Federal agencies to get better information about people and products that come into America. It requires every foreign visitor desiring entrance into the United States to carry a travel document containing biometric identification that would be fingerprints or facial recognition that will enable us to use technology to better deny fraudulent entry into America. It strengthens the requirements that all commercial passenger ships and airplanes entering the United States provide a list of passengers and crew before arrival, so that border authorities can act immediately to prevent someone from entering the country if he or she poses a threat to our citizens. It makes a lot of sense to do that. We should have probably been doing it a long time ago. These new measures will only be effective if Federal authorities have access to important information. One of the things we have learned is how to better share information. Right now, the FBI and the CIA do a good job of sharing information.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningtheenhancedbordersecurityandvisaentryreformact2002", "title": "Remarks on Signing the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-the-enhanced-border-security-and-visa-entry-reform-act-2002", "publication_date": "14-05-2002", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

I want to say too, again, I am glad that we are working to put 100,000 police officers on the streets of America, that we are putting community policing in every community in the country that is willing to receive it. But what really makes it work are law enforcement officers committed to it and citizens groups working on it. Today I had a very impressive briefing from people involved in the San Diego citizens patrol in the Safe Streets Now program. So I ask you, do not stop now. We need more citizens working with more police officers until crime is the exception, not the rule. When you are surprised when you hear about a crime, then you will know you have got a safe community. And you need to continue to do it. The second thing we are doing is to put criminals behind bars. And after they serve their time, if they do not belong here in the first place, they are being deported. The crime bill gave us the weapons we need to do things that had not been done before to deal with the problems of criminal activities by illegal immigrants. As of January of last year, we have arrested more than 1,700 criminal aliens and prosecuted them on Federal felony charges because they returned to America after having been deported in the first place. We are changing the policy of this country on that problem. We are also making strides in getting control of our border. We have added Border Patrol agents, in San Diego alone increasing by 762 the number of agents who are working for you by the end of this year. In El Paso, our border guards stand so close together, they can actually all see each other. Here in San Diego, control has been taken back of Imperial Beach from the criminals and the illegals. We deployed underground sensors, infrared night scopes, encrypted radios. We built miles of new fences, installed thousands of watts of new lighting. I heard what was said earlier about the threats facing San Diego residents in East County, particularly with the onset of the fire season.

And to me, we had a series of battles that were really the latest incarnation of this ageold battle of what does it mean to be an American, what is the idea of America, what is the purpose of a nation? There was my veto of the Newt tax bill after Newt was gone. The battle over the same thing is now happening, shaping up over the courts. The most important issue in this election may well be what happens to the courts. Because there is now already we are one vote away from having enough votes that would repeal Roe v.Wade. But there is this other issue in the courts which I think is quite profound, which is, there are five votes right now to restrict the ability of Congress to require the States to participate in protecting the American people in a lot of fundamental ways. But it is the same battle that we had between George Washington and John Adams and Alexander Hamilton and John Marshall on the one side and Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Payne, and a lot of other people on the other in the beginning; the same battle Abraham Lincoln had around the time of the Civil War. Did the Federal Government have the power to enslave them? The same battle we had at the dawn of the industrial revolution when Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson asserted the authority of the Nation to proscribe basic conditions in the workplace and protection. And it was the same battle that Franklin Roosevelt fought. Now we are in the fifth battle over how to define America. And in the first three skirmishes, we won.

Now, remember why we came together in 2008. It was because we saw that the basic bargain that built this country, that created the most prosperous economy the world has ever known, that basic bargain was not being met. And let me tell you what that bargain is. It says that if you act responsibly and you put in enough effort, you can find a job that pays the bills. You can have a home that you call your own. You will not go broke just because somebody in your family gets sick. You can retire with dignity and respect. And most importantly, you can give your kids a great education so they can dream even bigger and do even better than you did. But the problem was for a decade we had seen that bargain was not being met. So we had seen a decade in which jobs were being shipped overseas and wages and incomes for working people were going down, even though folks at the very top were doing very well, and the costs of everything from health care to college were going up. We ran two wars on a credit card. We went from surplus to deficit. So when I walked into office we already had a $1 trillion deficit. And it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That is the track record of the other party the last time they were in charge. And we knew that restoring the bargain that made this country great would not be easy. It was going to take more than one year or one term or even more than one ENTITY, but we knew we had to get started. And obviously, it became that much harder when the middle class was hammered by this crisis because a lot of folks lost jobs, lost homes, lost savings, and that American Dream seemed even further out of reach.

That is noble, and it is important for spreading peace, because democracies do not fight. We are democracies, and we coexist peacefully, and we work together to keep the peace.

The Congress should reconsider its recent actions which cut sharply into our national electric power policy. submitting to the Congress appropriation requests for certain power projects which must be provided right away. These requests include the TVA steamplant at New Johnsonville, Tenn., and certain other projects on which congressional reductions, if allowed to stand, will delay the production of power for a year or more. These appropriations should be promptly enacted, and at the same time certain crippling limitations should be removed from the law. In the final days before adjourning in June, the Congress passed a bill raising the salaries of some Federal employees. However, this bill neglected long overdue reforms in the Federal pay scales and discriminated unfairly against certain groups of employees. The Congress should take this opportunity to enact more equitable and realistic Federal pay legislation. Finally, I again urge upon the Congress the measures I recommended last February to protect and extend basic civil rights of citizenship and human liberty. A number of bills to carry out my recommendations have been introduced in the Congress. Many of them have already received careful consideration by congressional committees. Only one bill, however, has been enacted, a bill relating to the rights of Americans of Japanese origin. I believe that it is necessary to enact the laws I have recommended in order to make the guarantees of the Constitution real and vital. I believe they are necessary to carry out our American ideals of liberty and justice for all. I hope that there is no misunderstanding of the recommendations I have made. I urge the Congress not to be distracted from these central purposes. At the same time, as I have stated, the Congress can and should act on certain other important items of legislation at this special session.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsmessagethespecialsessionthe80thcongress", "title": "Message to the Special Session of the 80th Congress", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/message-the-special-session-the-80th-congress", "publication_date": "27-07-1948", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S.

I was working here in the summer 1970 and there was a dinner where he was, and I did not go shake hands with him, because I was young and mad about the Vietnam war.

I mean, he was still denying that he was addicted right up until the time that he was sentenced. So I am not so sure that incarceration is all bad, even for drug offenders, depending on the facts. Let me finish. I think the sentences in many cases are too long for non-violent offenders. I think the sentences are too long, and the facilities are not structured to maximize success when the people get out. Keep in mind, 90 percent of the people that are in the penitentiary are going to get out. So society's real interest is seeing that we maximize the chance that when they get out, that they can go back to being productive citizens, that they will get jobs, they will pay taxes, they will be good fathers and mothers, that they will do good things. You have got mandatory minimums. Would you do away with those? I certainly think they should be reexamined and the disparities are unconscionable between crack and powdered cocaine. I tried to change the disparities, and the Republican Congress was willing to narrow, but not eliminate, them on the theory that people who use crack are more violent than people who use cocaine. Well, what they really meant was that people who use crack are more likely to be poor and, coincidentally, black or brown and, therefore, not have money. Whereas, people who use cocaine were more likely to be rich, pay for it, and therefore be peaceable. But my own view is, if you do something violent, it is appropriate to have an incarceration. But I think we need a serious re-examination in the view toward what would make us a more peaceful, more productive society.

{"id": 4503, "text": "One is in the area of transportation, and we will recognize some that have achieved superior performance already. And we also are launching, with as effective a program as possible throughout our Nation, a means by which we conserve energy within individual homes. And we think that each home, on the average, can save 25 percent of the energy it has been consuming. This can be done through tax credits to encourage the weatherization of homes, the installation of devices like thermostats, that are timed by day, to prevent excessive air conditioning or heating loads when they are not needed, because somebody might be absent-minded and not change the thermostat when they could have changed it, and of course, the installation of solar heating devices of all kinds. We have received from the transportation industry about 190 different specific commitments derived from the previous meeting that we have had here. The homes will be the second achievement and a third one that we are working for is in the field of agriculture. I have been a farmer almost all my life, except when I have been in government service. All of my people before me for many generations have been full-time farmers, and I know from practical experience that, in my earlier days, we had much less dependence upon bought fuels for the heating or drying of crops and for cultivation and, as any farm agent knows and as any superior farmer knows, minimum tillage can be an advantage and not a disadvantage. And the sun-drying of our crops, instead of using imported oil or natural gas or butane, can be a very efficient way to do an equally superior job. We anticipate that if the farmers can save only 5 percent of the energy they use compared to a year ago and if homeowners can reduce, by an amount that I have already described, that we can cut our oil imports at a $32 per barrel price by roughly $20 billion each year. We have, finally, a need to expand the public awareness of what can be done. A lot of people have feared energy conservation because it is new to them, and they have assumed, incorrectly, that to save energy in their own lives, in their homes, on their farms, in their businesses, in their transportation, would cause them to lead an inferior quality of life compared to what they had been using, to which they had been accustomed.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksceremonyannouncethenationalenergyefficiencyprogramssecondphaseandpresent", "title": "Remarks at a Ceremony To Announce the National Energy Efficiency Program's Second Phase and Present Transportation Efficiency Awards", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-ceremony-announce-the-national-energy-efficiency-programs-second-phase-and-present", "publication_date": "22-07-1980", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Jimmy Carter"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I was not surprised that my announcement set off some pretty sharp rhetoric from the other side, but I'd like to think that with some good will and common sense Republicans and Democrats could rise above election-year politics for the good of our country. Certainly there are important areas-and three come immediately to mind-where we could and should be working together. For example, I believe there is basis for agreement on a down payment on projected budget deficits. I think we could reduce projected deficits by at least $100 billion over the next 3 years. So, frankly, I was a bit puzzled why those new converts to concern about looming deficits held back on joining a bipartisan working group. I urge them to approach the negotiations in the same spirit as we will. Let us try to put the partisan issues aside. I repeat that all issues can be on the table for discussion. But, obviously, we cannot compromise the principles of our tax program without compromising our economic recovery and America's future. I simply cannot agree to increase taxes on families already pinching pennies to pay their bills. We want to reduce the deficit, not the recovery. And it would be foolhardy, indeed, to compromise America's defense rebuilding program just as we are beginning to restore the credibility that was so recklessly squandered. Yet this does not mean that there are not areas in which to find bipartisan agreement. We could focus on the less contentious spending cuts still pending before the Congress. These could be combined with measures to close certain tax loopholes that the Treasury Department has indicated it believes worthy of support. If we focus on what we might agree on, we can get something done for the people. And the Grace commission has come up with some 2,500 recommendations for reducing wasteful government spending. We should examine them together. Uniting to promote democracy, peace, and prosperity in the troubled region of Central America is a second area where Republicans and Democrats should work together.

I would also like to say one more word about Tipper and about the Vice President, about the way they have dealt with this issue as a family and the gifts they have given to America, going back to before the time when we all became a team in the election of 1992, when they began their annual family conferences. All people in public life talk about family values. No couple in public life has ever done remotely as much to try to figure out what it would mean to turn those family values into real, concrete improvements in the lives of ordinary families as Al and Tipper Gore have over a long period of time. I sort of feel like an anticlimax at this convention-not for the reasons the political reporters think--but because the real story here is in the people who have already talked, in their stories of courage and struggle, of endurance and hope. Americans with mental illness should have the same opportunity all Americans have to live to the fullest of their God-given ability. They are, perhaps, just the latest in our enduring challenge as a people to continue the work of our Founders, to widen the circle of opportunity, to deepen the meaning of freedom, to strengthen the bonds of our community.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthewhitehouseconferencementalhealth", "title": "Remarks at the White House Conference on Mental Health", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-white-house-conference-mental-health", "publication_date": "07-06-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

But as all of you know because you were involved in 2008 or 2012, it does not work if we do not have folks on the ground who are speaking out on behalf of these issues and these values. Politics has become so toxic and information is so contested and people are separated from how they get news, that oftentimes to break through, what is necessary is the validation of a neighbor or a friend or a coworker or a family member. And that is where OFA comes in, because it is able to, in very concrete terms, help to generate people's energy and mobilize their interest around these issues in ways that are not abstract, but are very concrete and very specific and that reach people where they live, at the kitchen table, and at the water cooler at work. And that grassroots work that is done also then energizes me and informs the issues that we are going to try to lift up over the course of the next year. So I just want to say to all of you, what you are doing is really important, and we really appreciate it. It is often at the ground level, but it makes a difference. And one final example of that difference that is being made is when it comes to the Affordable Care Act. But as a consequence of some of the folks that have been doing this work on the ground, as of today, we have signed up more than 4 million people through the exchanges. That is 4 million people who have the security of health care, in many cases for the very first time. And that does not count the 3 million who are already able to get health insurance because they are staying on their parent's plan. That does not count the millions who have been able to sign up through Medicaid. So when you have got grassroots folks who are committed and energized like they are, it makes a difference. And whatever issues you care about, whether it is climate change or women's reproductive health or foreign policy or education or access to higher education, having folks who are willing to fight for what they believe in connected to what we do here is really powerful and important.

One group is talking about space and defense weapons; one is talking about strategic weapons; and the third one is talking about the intermediate-range weapons in Europe. And Mr. Gromyko himself said there is no way to control that, that it is not covered by any treaty. And the plain truth of the matter is, they have been doing the same kind of research in the same areas and started it before we did. Now, I do mean that if this research could lead to the kind of a weapon that would make one have to think twice as to whether they could be successful with the use of nuclear weapons, then it would lead to the very thing that both the late Mr. Chernenko and Gromyko have said, and that is that they would like to see the elimination of nuclear weapons; so would we. And if a defensive weapon that could be successful against them helps bring that about by making them too costly to take the chance of putting those costly things in the air only to be shot down, then we'd be further on the way toward the elimination of nuclear weapons. Do we need an interim agreement to keep the number of missiles down while we are having these talks? Look, we can settle it right here. We are ready to go all the way on the elimination of nuclear weapons. But I did not get an answer. But, yes, I would think that the logical thing would be to start with the reduction of the numbers of weapons, to get them down to a lower level. My hope has been that once we start on that path, that gradually everyone would see that it makes more sense to keep on going until you have eliminated them. Would it be wise to try to achieve that sort of interim agreement about the time when the SALT II limitations would have expired, that have been generally observed by both sides? Oh, I have not really thought about whether that makes any difference or not. It is just that the world is living under a threat; and other people are going to try, as we know, to get missiles themselves.

That we make investments in our infrastructure and railroads and canals and land-grant colleges and the National Academy of Sciences, because that provides us all with an opportunity to fulfill our potential, and we will all be better off as a consequence. He also had a sense of deep, profound empathy, a sense of the intrinsic worth of every individual, which led him to his opposition to slavery and ultimately to signing the Emancipation Proclamation. That view of life - as one in which we are all connected, as opposed to all isolated and looking out only for ourselves - that is a view that has made America great and allowed us to stitch together a sense of national identity out of all these different immigrant groups who have come here in waves throughout our history.

I do not know whether you are aware that Mr. Brezhnev said that detente was serving their purpose and that by 1985, they would be able to get whatever they wanted by other means. So, I have no illusions about them. But I do believe that the Soviets can be dealt with if you deal with them on the basis of what is practical for them and that you can point out is to their advantage as well as ours to do certain things.

Well, the Republicans tried for years to convince the American people that only one party had values. And unfortunately-I believe it was unfortunate-they were too often rewarded for that. But I never believed that only Republicans could stand up for the American family. I never believed that only Republicans could be tough on crime. The first bill I signed was the Family and Medical Leave Act. My predecessor, my Republican predecessor, vetoed it twice, and Senator Dole led the fight against it. I fought the crime bill through, which put 100,000 police on the street, banned assault weapons, and had tougher punishment programs and prevention programs for young people. The bitterest, I mean really, literally, bitterest opponent of the crime bill in the entire Congress was Senator Dole. Now, who is strong against crime? We have got 4 years of declining crime. So I did not steal their values. On welfare reform, long before they ever passed a bill, 3 months into my Presidency I granted the first waiver to a State to try a welfare-to-work experiment. We now have 1.8 million fewer people on welfare than we did the day I took office- before this welfare bill takes effect. So I did not steal their values agenda. I believe they are American values, and I did something about it. And I think they are angry because they made so many votes for years just by talking about it and not doing anything about it. So we did something about it, and they are complaining about it.

It can work the other way around just as easily. Just as we can shape our children's preferences for high-calorie, low-nutrient foods, with a little persistence and creativity we can also turn them on to higher quality, healthier foods. It starts with offering healthier options designed specifically for kids. And today, no matter what kind of restaurant you visit -- whether it is Italian, French, Mexican, American -- most kids' menus look pretty much the same. And trust me, we have seen a lot of them. One local survey found that 90 percent of those menus includes mac and cheese -- our children's favorite; 80 percent includes chicken fingers; 60 includes burgers or cheeseburgers. Some options weigh in at over 1,000 calories, and that is close to the recommended amount that a child should have for the entire day. And I think -- and I know you all think -- that our kids deserve better than that. That is why I want to challenge every restaurant to offer healthy menu options and then provide them up front so that parents do not have to hunt around and read the small print to find an appropriately sized portion that does not contain levels -- high levels of fat, salt and sugar. These choices have to be easy to make and they have to give parents the confidence to know that they can go into any restaurant in this country and choose a genuinely healthy meal for their kids. It is not easy to come up with choices that are both healthy and palatable for kids. And it may mean putting in some real effort and creativity to make this happen. But what it does not mean is providing just one token healthy option on the menu, or taking out one problematic ingredient and replacing it with another. And it is not about finding creative ways to market unhealthy food products as healthy. Instead, it is about producing products that actually are healthy; products that can help our children get into the habits that will last them a lifetime.

The greetings that I have received in passing to and fro through West Virginia are most encouraging. You have been generous, and you have given a profound indication to the country as to where you will stand on the 8th day of November. A short occasion like this renders it difficult to adequately speak on national issues. I have seen this morning an advertisement of a New York retail establishment, in which they state that they are able to offer hosiery at prices which are demonstrated by our officials as 30 to 40 percent less than you can manufacture them in this community, and that the reason they are able to offer them at these prices is due to the depreciated currencies abroad and their ability to take advantage of that lower exchange in securing commodities in competition with your workmen. And in the face of this our Democratic opponents propose to reduce the tariff as it stands. The Republican Party not only proposes to hold the tariff where it stands but through the Tariff Commission, whose authorities were created by the Republican Party in the Smoot-Hawley bill about a year ago, we propose a review of the differences in cost of production at home and abroad and determine if we are justified in an adjustment that should protect your community. If this advertisement is true I am confident that it will show such a change in the costs of production as will make it possible to give to you relief. And I ask you whether the fate of your city and your community and your State will be more safe in the hands of the party which has fathered and for 70 years supported and strengthened the protective tariff than in the hands of the party who have always opposed these policies and who now promise a reduction of these protective tariffs.

The early stages of the depression were more or less the normal stages of retribution from overspeculation and exploitation of our people. We have experienced them many times before and recovery has speedily followed.

When I was president, illegal alien criminals knew that if they trespassed across our border, they would be caught, they would be detained, and they would be sent to jail, or we would send them the hell back to where they came from. We created the most secure border in all of American history by far. Biden's border crisis is also helping drive an unprecedented crime wave, and you see the crime wave. Even without this you see all in Democrat run cities. The bloodshed and violence in these cities is reaching epidemic proportions. Homicides are up 42% in Los Angeles, 37% in Philadelphia, 68% in Atlanta, and over 500% in Portland over this time last year. What they did to Portland, and nothing happens to Antifa, and nothing happens to BLM. But to people that are patriots or conservatives or Republicans, they stay in jails for extended periods of time, and they destroy their lives. We are not going to take it anymore. In New York City, crime is out of control. It is at record levels with nobody being prosecuted except of course innocent Republicans are being prosecuted. The Democrats know their policies on crime are so unpopular, so radical, so crazy, they are now trying to pretend they never led the defund the police movement in the first place. We never said defund the police. You know who did it? The Republicans did it. That is what they do. ENTITY had to do with Russia. He loves Russia. He loves Putin. He loves everybody.

If you support defunding the police, vote for the radical left Democrats, and you see what is happening to the cities where they defunded the police. If you want more police and more cops on the streets, vote for America first Republicans or let us put it very simply, vote for MAGA.

I take especial satisfaction in this day. As the recipient of an honorary degree in 1956 from Boston College, and therefore an instant alumnus, I am particularly pleased to be with all of you on this most felicitous occasion. This university, or college, as Father Walsh has described, was founded in the darkest days of the Civil War, when this Nation was engaged in a climactic struggle to determine whether it would be half slave and half free or all free. And now, 100 years later, after the most intense century perhaps in human history, we are faced with the great question of whether this world will be half slave and half free, or whether it will be all one or the other. And on this occasion, as in 1863, the services of Boston College are still greatly needed. It is good also to participate in this ceremony which has honored three distinguished citizens of the free world--President Pusey, Father Bunn, and our friend from the world of freedom, Lady Jackson. Boston College is a hundred years old-old by the life span of men, but young by that of universities. In this week of observance, you have rightly celebrated the achievements of the past, and equally rightly you have turned in a series of discussions by outstanding scholars to the problems of the present and the future. Learned men have been talking here of the knowledge explosion, and in all that they have said I am sure they have implied the heavy present responsibility of institutions like this one. Yet today I want to say a word on the same theme, to impress upon you as urgently as I can the growing and insistent importance of universities in our national life. I speak of universities because that is what Boston College has long since become. But most of what I say applies to liberal arts colleges as well. My theme is not limited to any one class of universities, public or private, religious or secular. Our national tradition of variety in higher education shows no sign of weakening, and it remains the task of each of our institutions to shape its own role among its differing sisters. In this hope I am much encouraged by a reading in this last week of the remarkable encyclical, Pacem in Terris.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthebostoncollegecentennialceremonies", "title": "Address at the Boston College Centennial Ceremonies", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-boston-college-centennial-ceremonies", "publication_date": "20-04-1963", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["John F.

It is the same intelligence that was used by my predecessor to bomb Iraq. I am very confident we got good intelligence. And not only that, Mr. David Kay, who went over to kind of lead the effort to find the weapons or the intent of weapons, came back with a report that clearly stated that Mr. Saddam Hussein would-had been in material breach of Resolution 1441. In other words, had the inspectors found what Kay found, they would have reported back to the United Nations that he was in breach, that he was in violation of exactly what the United Nations expected him not to do. We will find the truth. But this guy for many years had been hiding weapons, deceiving weapons. He had dual-use programs that could have been sped up. Not only was he a danger to the free world-and that is what the world said; the world said it consistently-he was a danger to his own people as well. Remember, we discovered mass graves with hundreds of thousands of men and women and children clutching their little toys, as a result of this person's brutality.

And how is that going to strengthen U.S.-Brazil relations? I can remember my first visit with President Lula. He was not sure what to expect when he came to the Oval Office, and frankly, I was not sure what to expect when he came. You know, people have reputations that precede them in life. And yet, after we spent a brief period of time, we both came to realize, we share the same concerns, particularly for the poor, and we both represent big, influential nations; and that we can work together to achieve common objectives. And one such objective is human rights and rule of law, a civil society that empowers individuals; that we believe government ought to respond to people and that people ought to have the ultimate say in the fate of government. We came from different political directions-I readily concede-but nevertheless, when we listened carefully, we found common ground. And that puts us in a position where we can work in practical ways to address significant problems. One such problem is trade, and President Lula and I will spend time on the Doha round to determine whether or not we are able to advance Doha in a constructive way that benefits our nations and, equally importantly, the world's poor. The best way to alleviate poverty is for there to be prosperity, and one way to enhance prosperity is through a world that trades freely and fairly. The other area-another area of common ground is changing our energy uses. My last trip to Brazil, I was briefed extensively on Brazil's capacity to use its raw materials to develop a vast ethanol industry. And I was impressed by the progress Brazil has made. It reminded me of-the progress Brazil has made has reminded me of the vast potential that agricultural can make on the energy front. So I now return to Brazil with a robust domestic agenda on ethanol. We had already had an agenda on ethanol, but it is now even more robust as a result of a mandatory fuel standard I laid out that said, the United States will be consuming about 35 billion gallons of ethanol. The political implications of that, at least for the United States, are profound, in that we become less dependent on oil, which is good for our national security, as well as it helps us be good stewards of the environment.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists", "title": "Interview With Foreign Print Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-print-journalists", "publication_date": "06-03-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

Would you accept some delay-if not 6 months, which I know you do not want-but some delay in providing military aid if that meant Congress would approve your request? Well, I think there is several ways in which things like that are being suggested. First of all, from the time that they would-if they would vote to approve this aid, there would be a period of time before it would actually be carried out. And, yes, if there is any possibility that during that time, and perhaps to forestall such aid, that they would then be willing to come to the negotiating table-as we have tried to get them nine times already-and to negotiate with the contras, that'd be fine. But if we are talking about some kind of a compromise where the Congress imposes a delay and takes the trigger away from me in- You mean like requiring a second vote? Yes, there would be a second vote and so forth, I think this would be most counterproductive because the Sandinistas would feel they could hang on longer with the hope that we still would not get what we are asking for. If, for example, a delay of, say, 60 to 75 days, after which the aid would go whether-without a second congressional vote, does that seem like the basis for a compromise to you? Well, I'd be willing to talk to them about something of this kind. I would not want to commit to this because, as I say, the important thing is that the Sandinista government must not be left any loopholes in which they believe there still might be a denial of this help.

Number one, all the participating countries recognize that in the face a severe global contraction we have to each take steps to promote economic growth and trade; that means a robust approach to stimulus, fighting off protectionism. Next, we have to make sure that we are all taking serious steps to deal with the problems in the banking sector and the financial markets and that means having a series of steps to deal with toxic assets and to ensure adequate capital in the banking sector. Third, a regulatory reform agenda that prevents these kinds of systemic risks from occurring again and that requires each country to take initiative, but it also requires coordination across borders because we have a global, we have global capital markets, and that will include a wide range of steps, additional monitoring authority coordination of supervisors and various countries dealing with offshore tax havens. I know that in my discussion I think there is a concern that we do not want people to be able to game the system or circumvent regulated capital markets and making sure our regulations are targeting not just banks but any institution that could pose a potential systemic risk to the system. A final area of concerted action involves international financial institutions and their capacity to assist emerging markets in developing countries at a time when those markets could be under even more severe strain then some of the more wealthy nations and I think making sure that institutions like the IMF have the resources to provide such assistance that world food supplies are not imperiled as a consequence of the break down in global trade, those are all issues that I think have to be addressed.

So there is plenty of loopholes, whether it is people shipping jobs overseas who gets preferential tax treatment, the subsidies to the energy companies, loopholes for, you know, billionaires, there are things we can close here to make our tax system fair... So you are saying no deal if they do not give on taxes? We need balance, ENTITY. We need -- we need spending cuts, entitlement reform, and revenue. We have to have that. Let me also talk about immigration. The president has identified immigration reform as another top priority of his second term. You just mentioned it again. The Republican senator, Marco Rubio, has been taking the lead this week. And Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, had some positive words about his proposals this week. But Marco Rubio said this week -- and he was on Bill O'Reilly's show -- that the president has not reached out to him. And I think during that process, I think there will be discussions that we, the president, the administration has with members of Congress and Congress among themselves. But what is clear is, this -- the stars are aligned for immigration reform. By the way, it needs to be real immigration reform, not symbolic. But are not you going to have to team up with Marco Rubio to get it done? And I do think that there is broad Republican support around the country, not as much in Congress, but maybe we are beginning to see a change there. The stars are aligned for progress here on, you know, building on the border security progress we have made, holding businesses accountable, in terms of hiring legal immigrants, in terms of a pathway to earned citizenship. So I do think the moment is here right now to finally get this done, high-skilled workers for our businesses. There is a lot that we can do. But those are all things that he is talking about, as well. Would not it be a more powerful position if the president and a key Republican like that had a united front? Well, ENTITY, this process will begin shortly, another effort here to finally get immigration reform. And at that point, I think you are going to see us working with Democrats and Republicans, people outside of Washington, there is a huge consensus in the business community, in the faith community for immigration reform.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "abcnewsgocomPoliticsweektranscriptobamasenioradviserdavidplouffestoryid18241822", "title": "'This Week' Transcript: Obama Senior Adviser David Plouffe", "source": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-obama-senior-adviser-david-plouffe/story?id=18241822", "publication_date": "17-01-2013", "crawling_date": "27-06-2023", "politician": ["David Plouffe"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Miss Liberty, for her part, had been badly corroded by decades of salt air; her iron supports had weakened; in places, she'd become pocked with jagged, rusty holes. Well, then, in 1982 the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation was formed to restore Miss Liberty and rebuild Ellis Island, and to do so with private funds. This effort has become one of the largest private sector initiatives in American history. Across America, everyone is lending a hand; major corporations are making contributions; small businesses are helping out. And I am pleased to say that just as schoolchildren helped raise the money to build her pedestal and install Miss Liberty back in the 1880's, today, a century later, they are holding bake sales and car washes to see to it that she gets the restoration she needs. Let me give you just three of many stirring examples. Michael Haverly, of Indianapolis, Indiana, has raised over $5,000 for the statue by going door to door with an appeal to help Miss Liberty. Well, I am proud to be in Michael's company here in the Rose Garden today. And then, there is Amy Nessler, of West Deptford Township, New Jersey, who brought a jar of 365 pennies into her first-grade class to help raise money for the Statue of Liberty. The pennies had been collected 15 years earlier by Amy's mother, who, day by day, put one into a jar to mark the time that her fianc was in Vietnam. And now, after all these years, they felt it was only appropriate to give these special coins to Lady Liberty, who symbolizes what Amy's dad fought for freedom. Well, I am very happy that Amy, her mother, and father are here with us today. When Donna's hometown learned that she was losing her sight to an incurable eye disease, they pitched in to raise money to send her and her family to visit the Statue of Liberty. However, Donna, in the spirit of generosity, donated part of this contribution to the Liberty Restoration Project. And, Donna, you are a fine example to us all.

Now, there will be, I am sure, some discussion about how you implement that decision, but the policy decision has been made. This is a step along the way of implementing that policy. Thursday night, the House -- or Thursday, rather, the House passed a resolution saying that the President has roughly two weeks to provide a whole bunch of information and answer a whole bunch of questions about the Libya military operation with the not-so-veiled threat that the Defense bill is coming up and that funds for that operation could be withheld if answers are not forthcoming.

You made some rather provocative statements, but you did not quite, in the minds of many, offer that apology for slavery. Your race commission, subsequently, has punted, if I could use that phrase, the question of the slavery apology.

I said, Well, Department of Labor. We love it. And he is now working on an expansion of that, including even larger groups of people. For the first time ever, sole proprietors will be able to come together and buy lower-cost group insurance instead of getting ripped off by this disaster that we all know as Obamacare. These actions will result in very low prices, much more choice, much more freedom, including in many cases new opportunities to purchase health insurance. You will be able to do this across state lines. I'd say, Alex, I want to cross state lines. He said, Do not worry about it.

But how do we fix what you just said? Right well, I am going to get to that. So the point is though, that we can break it out into these component parts and we can say number one, there is specific ways that we can make police-community relations better and make police more accountable. And so we put together a task force with police officers and young people, including some of the people who lead the Ferguson marches, and surprisingly they came up with a consensus of things that could be done that would make things better. Now, in the mean time what are we doing to help those lowest income communities? We know that, for example, early childhood education works. That is one way to break the legacy of racism and poverty. Right - and has a teacher that is trained in early childhood development and is hearing enough words and is being engaged enough, they can get to where a middle class kid is pretty quickly. It happens in this community or this school district or this neighborhood or this outstanding principal is making something happen. Or this philanthropist has decided- decided to do something. But what has not happened is us making a collective commitment to do it. Mmhm - how to deal with issues of some of the police shootings that have been involved, I am less interested in having an ideological conversation than I am looking at what has worked in the past- Mmhm - and applying it and scaling up. What is required is a sense on the part of all of us that what happens to those kids matters to me even if I never meet them because my society is going to be better off. I am going to feel better about the America I live in and overtime I am confident that my children and my grandchildren are going to live a better life if those kids also have opportunity.

Today I want to outline the broader vision that I believe should guide these policies, and it is a vision that will keep our economy strong and growing and competitive in the 21st century. And that vision begins with a recognition of how our economy has changed over time. When Forsyth Technical opened 50 years ago, it was known as Forsyth County Industrial Education Center, right? Machine shops and automotive mechanics were some of the first classes you could take. Of course, back then you did not even need a degree to earn a decent living. You could get a job at the local tobacco or textile plant and still be able to provide for yourself and your family. In the last few decades, revolutions in communications, revolutions in technology, have made businesses mobile and has made commerce global. So today, a company can set up shop, hire workers, and sell their products wherever there is an Internet connection. That is a transformation that is touched off a fierce competition among nations for the jobs and industries of the future. Some of you know I traveled through Asia several weeks ago. You have got a billion people in India who are suddenly plugged into the world economy. You have got over a billion people in China who are suddenly plugged into the global economy. And that means competition is going to be much more fierce, and the winners of this competition will be the countries that have the most educated workers, a serious commitment to research and technology, and access to quality infrastructure like roads and airports and high-speed rail and high-speed Internet. Those are the seeds of economic growth in the 21st century. Where they are planted, the most jobs and businesses will take root. Now, in the last century, America was that place where innovation happened and jobs and industry always took root. The business of America was business. Our economic leadership in the world went unmatched. Now it is up to us to make sure that we maintain that leadership in this century. And at this moment, the most important contest we face is not between Democrats and Republicans, it is between America and our economic competitors all around the world.

These actions should help reduce the risk of gas shortages and price increases as a result of the hurricane. We also know a lot of people lost cell phone service because their particular carrier's tower went down or got damaged. A few days ago I asked the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, and my White House team to work with the cell phone companies to allow customers to use roaming services, so that means that folks in the area should be able to get a signal no matter what carrier they are up on. If they are one carrier down they can roam and use another carrier they are not part of, they are not signed up with.

Is there any likelihood that Saddam himself could be behind this violence? He had rape rooms, and people disappeared because they spoke out against him. We have discovered mass graves. We did the Iraqi people a great favor by removing him. So I would not be surprised that any kind of violence is promoted by him, but I do not know. All I know is, we are after him. That is one of the interesting things. I mean, nobody has time for a moment for Saddam Hussein. Some people are worried in England and around the world by the idea of regime change, because they say, Once we have done regime change, Britain and America with Saddam Hussein, what can we say if India wants to do regime change with Pakistan, or Pakistan wants to do regime change with India?

The main reason I decided this is I really believe that these three countries are the only three countries right now that can start tomorrow and within a reasonable time meet the same standard of membership militarily that the other NATO countries met. We have to remember, this alliance is the most successful alliance in history because it is had military as well as political integrity. But these other nations, I believe, that are either developing their economies and their military capacity, are stabilizing their democracies, should all be considered for future NATO membership. And the irony of this is, right now a lot of the European countries say five, and I say three, but over the long run we may find the United States in favor of considering more countries than a majority of Europeans would be. ENTITY, the government of Madrid wants to remain in the chain of command of NATO. Is Spain's petition to maintain under its control of the Canary Island territory acceptable for the United States? I think the Spanish position is certainly understandable, and it is my understanding that Spain is at least close to being satisfied with the discussions that have been held. The position the United States has taken on this is that the military experts should resolve this, that only Spain can decide whether its concerns about sovereignty and leadership have been satisfied. But for all of the rest of the countries, what we should do is to make this a military decision and see if we can resolve the issue with Spain in a way that is consistent with the way NATO should operate. And they are working very hard on it, and I hope and believe they will resolve it soon. On another security matter, ENTITY, you have nurtured the peace process in Northern Ireland personally, but things are looking very ominous, coming up to this weekend with the scheduled Loyalist march in Drumcree. No, I am not pessimistic, but frankly, the ball is in the IRA's court right now in terms of declaring a cease-fire, and then there is also a ball in the court of the Protestant Loyalists and whether they will continue to exercise restraint. But let me say, to me the most hopeful thing is that we have got this meeting, I believe, today between Prime Minister Blair and Mr. Ahern, the new Irish Prime Minister.

And that is what they really believe. I do not believe that, but that is what they believe. And then you have the people that are demonstrating on behalf of the Third World, and they believe our concern for labor and the environment is a protectionist ruse to protect American high-wage jobs. But they are all out there in the streets in Seattle demonstrating together, because they are genuinely frustrated about the way the world is going and they kind of do not like this whole globalization thing. They think it is going to lead to further loss of control by ordinary people over the basic circumstances of their lives, and that bothers them. I think that this is to kind of put a cap on the first question I mean, that is so much at the heart of what you have been trying to overcome. I was talked to Zoe Baird, who said that she always remembers the statistics that you used, I think in around '95, that more jobs had been created by companies owned by women than had been lost by Fortune 500 companies. You always tried to make the future less frightened for folks. And yet, I am not sure you are convinced that you made the case. Well, I think I made the case to the people that were open to it, but I believe that I think that it is hard. Everybody's for change in general, but normally against it in particular. You know, what is that Dick Riley used to say? That is his sort of formulation of it. But I still believe, first of all, I think that what I said to the American people is true and right. Secondly, I do not think there is any alternative to change.

That civil lawsuit against me was bogus. Even the judge, who was famous for disliking me personally, threw it out as having no merit. So I think that what it did was, at least for the time being, it took a lot of the venom out of our public life. You know, even as hard as George Bush and Al Gore are hitting each other now in this election, they are by and large hitting at each other over the issues. I mean, Bush has got some ad up now questioning Gore's integrity, which is amazing that Bush would question Gore's integrity, but anyway. But he knows that there is a certain number of voters who vote for Republicans because they are convinced that they are morally superior to Democrats, not withstanding the fact that we are awash in evidence now that they are not. And so he is doing that, but there has been very little of that, even from him. They are basically the level of venom is lower than it was. And maybe I absorbed enough for several years. Because I think it is just crazy for America with all these fabulous opportunities and some pretty stiff challenges out there to waste our elections and our public officials' time with things that we know are bogus or trivial and cost the taxpayers a fortune, for no other purpose than for one side to pursue political advantage over another. There will always be some of that, but my instinct is that in the next 4 years, we will have a lot less of it.

My girls are getting old enough now where I am clinging to those very last moments before they are out of the house. But there was a political organization that was built around you that still exists. Well, I am less likely to get involved in all the nuts and bolts of electioneering. In that realm, I am much more likely to just give advice. What I am interested in is just developing a whole new generation of talent. There are such incredible young people who not only worked on my campaign, but I have seen in advocacy groups. I have seen passionate about issues like climate change or conservation, criminal justice reform, you know, campaigns for a livable wage, or health insurance, and making sure that whatever resources, credibility, spotlight that I can bring to help them rise up.

In other words, there is just more than words there; we have achieved concrete results. For example, we ought to make sure that scores are tested early, particularly for big districts, so that people understand what the results are. Oftentimes in-I do not know how many big districts, Margaret-but I have heard complaints from school districts where the test scores get posted for the parents after the school year begins, which is like-it does not work. So the bureaucracy, frankly, has got to be a little more facile in getting the results out, and Margaret understands that. I think we ought to continue doing what we call the Teacher Incentive Fund. It allows States and school districts to reward teachers who demonstrate results for their students. If this school board decides they want to provide incentives for teachers based upon results, the Federal Government will provide money to help you do that. I like the idea.

And even though we have had some differences over trade matters, for example, when we had to have a real conflict over the treatment of automobiles and the auto parts, the Japanese are a great democracy and a strong ally for us, and our forces have been there now for quite a long time in genuine partnership. So if they think there is any kind of procedures we ought to take to improve things, we obviously are open to that. But I think as long as they know that we are not turning a blind eye to this, that we are outraged, that our heart goes out to them, they know that we have been a good partner and we respect them and we will continue to be.

We want to encourage and be helpful in privatization, and I think there is ways that we can encourage investment in Argentina, given these political reforms. So, it is across the board; it is not just one program.

So, I think you will see a whole new relationship between Argentina and the United States. This is on my mind because the Argentinian Ambassador presented his credentials yesterday, and well, he really said just about what I am saying here in terms of the feeling in Argentina about the United States. And I want to encourage as many of our top people to go there as possible; work closely with the finance people, the environment people, the military, whatever it is. So, we have a new era bilaterally; and I think, universally, there is a respect for what he is trying to do. first is subversion; second, the tensions in the military suspected of violation of human rights; and third, the economy and the foreign debt? Subversion: nobody is interested in doing anything other than to help stop possible subversion. Because as Chile moves towards its elections within the next few weeks, this is a very significant development; and it is one that, in my view, can result speaking as ENTITY in better relations with our country. On the military violations, this obviously is a matter where the people of Chile and the Government and everybody else has to respond. There is not much we can do about it.

ENTITY, yesterday you called for eliminating restrictions on the number of charter schools, while enforcing some vigorous standards. In Ohio, the Governor has called charter schools a destructive influence on public education, a few years ago tried to have a moratorium on new charters, now wants to cut State spending by about 20 percent for charter schools and restrict some other funding. I am wondering whether you have ever talked with him about this, and is this just a fundamental disagreement between the two of you? You know, I have not had a conversation with Governor Strickland. I know that part of his concern was prompted by some bad experiences with charters in Ohio that were not up to snuff. And if you looked at my statement yesterday, what I said was, not only should we lift the cap on charters, we should also shut down charters that are not meeting standards. I do not think that is inconsistent with Governor Strickland's position. My goal here is to create laboratories of innovation so that in the public school system, we are on a race to the top as opposed to stuck in the old ways of doing things. And we have got to; we have got to do that. In your home town of Cleveland, I do not know off the top of my head what the dropout rate is, but I have got to assume that it is hovering around 50 percent. If you look at the number of children going through the Cleveland public schools who are actually prepared to go to college, it is probably 1 out of 7 or 8 or 10. It is not acceptable for them; it is not acceptable in terms of America's economic future. And so we have got to experiment with ways to provide a better educational experience for our kids, and some charters are doing outstanding jobs. So the bottom line is to try to create innovation within the public school system that can potentially be scaled up, but also to make sure that we are maintaining very high standards for any charter school that is created. Well, I have to ask you an ethanol question.

In thinking about how he will convey this to the American people, do you think he will speak -- sort of review his policy and look forward over the next three years at all? Again, I think we are getting ahead of the process here. I am sure he will convey it. Suggestions for how and the format are way ahead of where we are right now. Can I go back to Julianna's question about Peter Diamond? You said you thought that the White House did everything possible to push this nomination forward. I mean, did the President pick up the phone and call Mr. Shelby? I do not have a tick-tock on the different actions that different members of the administration took in support of this nomination. We strongly supported it. We regret that it is come to this and he is withdrawn his nomination for understandable reasons. Again, he had -- enjoys significant bipartisan support, as he should have, given his qualifications.

And more broadly, it is just -- it is important for us to move forward in this process because these posts need to be filled precisely because we have such important issues before us in dealing with the economy. And so we look forward to working with Congress, working with the Senate, to get the nominee who replaces Mr. Diamond confirmed and other nominations that are still pending confirmed.

Well, you know, I try to avoid commenting on the day-to-day trends in the stock market.

The cost of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, as well as unemployment for young people just getting started in their careers, that is something that has devastating effects on the economy for generations, or for decades to come. So I think Janet Yellen has said this is a focus of ours right now. What that does mean is when you have got low interest rates that there is a lot of money looking for returns. And that is probably boosted the stock market significantly. My estimation is that, you know, you have got a lot of savvy investors out there. You have got people who recognize that what goes up can come down as well. I will leave it up to them to make determinations about whether valuations and stock prices are too high. I am more concerned about the day-to-day fundamentals. And if we get those fundamentals right, then I am pretty confident that we can do very well in the next decade.

They will have to work that out. So I think the question is not so much whether one is warranted but what kind of tax cut should it be, and how big should it be? My concern-what I have believed in-I said this back during the campaign period so I can reiterate it-my view is that it should not be so large as to preclude our continued ability to pay down the debt and to stay more or less on the track we are on to get the debt down over the next 10 years, because if the markets perceive that we are going back into deficits, that would lead to an increase in interest rates, which would wipe out the impact of a tax cut for most Americans-even wealthy Americans, because it could have a depressing impact on the market, and it certainly would increase the cost of business borrowing and tend to slow down the growth of the economy. So the trick is-that also, by the way, would foreclose-this is what happened to me when I got in. I did not have the option to do what Americans would normally-the Government would normally do in a recession, which is to have a substantial tax cut and pump the thing back up, because the deficit was so big, it would just have caused interest rates to skyrocket. So the trick for the incoming administration- they have lots of options here. They can spend money; they can cut taxes; they can do more of one or less of the other-and less of the other. But the real-what I would be thinking about if I were in that position is, what is the aggregate amount we are going to commit here, particularly on the tax cut side, because it is not like-you do not have to repeat spending in years 2, 3, and 4. You can cut spending if times are tough. We have proved that. But once the tax money-once you cut the taxes, that is normally gone.

And it started, I think, for one reason, and it is very obvious, one reason only. There are terrorist elements who know that they cannot succeed in their cause while the multinational force is there. And they are trying to take advantage of what they see as criticism here, lack of public support in the hope that public opinion will force the withdrawal of the multinational force. But what we should see is that the very fact they are doing that is proof of the fact that the multinational force was being successful in its purpose. Given that these terrorist attacks began, do you agree with the Long commission that the mission of the marines changed while they were there and that they were unwisely deployed, specifically at the Beirut Airport?

I believe strongly in stopping laws designed to take rights away and passing laws that extend equal rights to gay couples. I have required all agencies in the Federal Government to extend as many Federal benefits as possible to LGBT families as the current law allows. And I have called on Congress to repeal the so-called Defense of Marriage Act and to pass the Domestic Partners Benefits and Obligations Act. And we must all stand together against divisive and deceptive efforts to feed people's lingering fears for political and ideological gain. For the struggle waged by the Human Rights Campaign is about more than any policy we can enshrine into law. It is about our capacity to love and commit to one another. It is about whether or not we value as a society that love and commitment. It is about our common humanity and our willingness to walk in someone else's shoes, to imagine losing a job not because of your performance at work but because of your relationship at home, to imagine worrying about a spouse in the hospital with the added fear that you will have to produce a legal document just to comfort the person you love, to imagine the pain of losing a partner of decades and then discovering that the law treats you like a stranger. If we are honest with ourselves we will admit that there are too many who do not yet know in their lives or feel in their hearts the urgency of this struggle. That is why I continue to speak about the importance of equality for LGBT families, and not just in front of gay audiences. That is why Michelle and I have invited LGBT families to the White House to participate in events like the Easter Egg Roll, because we want to send a message.

Then they'd report back, be held accountable, and be elected or defeated by the voters. I think today there is so much-there is a lot of information about what we are doing up here, but I do not think there is a lot of basic understanding that we impart. And I think that voters know that too many decisions get made here on the basis of organized interest which may or may not be the same as the public interest. And I think that at a time of real change, when people are uncertain about where we are going, it is just easy for negative impulses, for fears, for cynicism to overcome hopes in looking toward the future. I also believe, and many astute people in the press have pointed this out lately, that voters themselves feel a certain ambivalence. That is, they want us to do things up here. I got elected to take action, to deal with the economy, to deal with crime, to deal with the breakdown of family, to promote welfare reform, to deal with the health care crisis. But people still basically are very skeptical about the Government's ability to do it. So we want, in a way, a Government that is more active but basically that is active in empowering the private sector to do things, rather than active in doing things directly. And a lot of times that explains the apparently contradictory feelings people have about what we are doing here, that they want us to be active and address the problems but they do not necessarily trust the Government to do it. Or as we say at home, a lot of people think Government would mess up a one-car parade. You are a student of history. Do you think that is because Camelot was illusory in the last analysis, that it is a mythical thing and that people are disappointed with both the Congress and various holders of your office?

It will not be tolerable to a number of states in that region for Iran to have a nuclear weapon and them not to have a nuclear weapon. Iran is known to sponsor terrorist organizations, so the threat of proliferation becomes that much more severe. We have applied a lot of pressure on North Korea as well and, in fact, today found them willing to suspend some of their nuclear activities and missile testing and come back to the table. But North Korea is even more isolated, and certainly less capable of shaping the environment than Iran is. And so the dangers of an Iran getting nuclear weapons that then leads to a free-for-all in the Middle East is something that I think would be very dangerous for the world. Do you see accidental nuclear escalation as an issue? Look, the fact is, I do not think any of it would be accidental. If Iran gets a nuclear weapon, I will not name the countries, but there are probably four or five countries in the Middle East who say, We are going to start a program, and we will have nuclear weapons. And at that point, the prospect for miscalculation in a region that has that many tensions and fissures is profound. You essentially then duplicate the challenges of India and Pakistan fivefold or tenfold. With everybody pointing at everybody else. With everybody pointing at everybody else. What I am getting at specifically is, let us assume there is a Hezbollah attack on Israel. Israel responds into Lebanon.   The potential for escalation in those circumstances is profoundly dangerous, and in addition to just the potential human costs of a nuclear escalation like that in the Middle East, just imagine what would happen in terms of the world economy. The possibilities of the sort of energy disruptions that we have never seen before occurring, and the world economy basically coming to a halt, would be pretty profound. So when I say this is in the U.S. interest, I am not saying this is something we'd like to solve. One of the aspects of this is the question of whether it is plausible that Barack Obama would ever use military power to stop Iran.

California, for example I hope it still prevails in spite of the fruit fly but California, over the years, puts about 40 percent of all the fruits and nuts and vegetables that are on the tables of America, puts them on those tables. I just think the marketplace regulates that. How do you feel about States putting fairly steep taxes on the resources that they extract from the ground whether it is food or minerals or oil and ship to other States and thereby in effect pass on that additional tax burden to the consumers in those other States. Well, you are speaking of severance taxes that come on. Well again, does not that balance out with everything else?

We brought back an auto industry from the brink of collapse. We helped our businesses create 14 million new jobs over the past 6 years. We cut the unemployment rate from 10 percent to 4.9 percent. We covered nearly 18 million more Americans with health insurance. We ignited a clean energy revolution. We got bin Laden. We brought the vast majority of our troops home to their families.

And as an American citizen, I understand that our progress is not inevitable. It must be fought for and won by all of us, with the kind of patriotism that our fellow Illinoisan, Adlai Stevenson, once described not as a short, frenzied outburst of emotion, but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime. It requires citizenship and a sense that we are one. And today, that kind of citizenship is threatened by a poisonous political climate that pushes people away from participating in our public life. It turns folks off. It discourages them, makes them cynical. And when that happens, more powerful and extreme voices fill the void.

In Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge began a murderous rule in which hundreds of thousands of Cambodians died by starvation and torture and execution. In Vietnam, former allies of the United States and government workers and intellectuals and businessmen were sent off to prison camps, where tens of thousands perished. Hundreds of thousands more fled the country on rickety boats, many of them going to their graves in the South China Sea. Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam war and how we left. There is no debate in my mind that the veterans from Vietnam deserve the high praise of the United States of America. Whatever your position is on that debate, one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like boat people, reeducation camps, and killing fields. There was another price to our withdrawal from Vietnam, and we can hear it in the words of the enemy we face in today's struggle, those who came to our soil and killed thousands of citizens on September the 11th, 2001. In an interview with a Pakistani newspaper after the 9/11 attacks, Usama bin Laden declared that the American people had risen against their Government's war in Vietnam, and they must do the same today. His number-two man, Zawahiri, has also invoked Vietnam. In a letter to Al Qaida's chief of operations in Iraq, Zawahiri pointed-and I quote-to the aftermath of the collapse of the American power in Vietnam and how they ran and left their agents. Zawahiri later returned to this theme, declaring that the Americans, quote, know better than others that there is no hope in victory. The Vietnam specter is closing every outlet. Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see it differently. We must listen to the words of the enemy.

Sometimes in this town, we talk about these things in clinical and academic ways. With 1 in 10 Americans out of work and millions more underemployed, not having enough hours to support themselves, this is a struggle that cuts deep, and it touches people across this Nation. Every day, I meet people or I hear from people who talk about sending out resume after resume, and they have been on the job hunt for a year or a year and a half and still cannot find anything and are desperate. They have not just lost the paycheck they need to live; they are losing the sense of dignity and identity that comes from having a job. I hear from businessowners who face the heartbreak of having to lay off longtime employees or shutting their doors altogether, in some cases businesses that they have taken years to build, in some cases businesses that they inherited from their parents or their grandparents. And I see communities devastated by lost jobs and devastated by the fear that those jobs are never coming back. Now, as Joe mentioned, it is true that we have seen a significant turnaround in the economy overall since the beginning of the year. Our economy was in a freefall. Our financial system was on the verge of collapse. We were losing 700,000 jobs per month. And it was clear then that our first order of business was to keep a recession from slipping into a depression, from preventing financial meltdown and getting the economy growing again, because we knew that without economic growth, there would be little to nothing we could do to stem job losses. And we knew that trying to create jobs in an economy based on inflated home prices and maxed-out credit cards and overleveraged banks was akin to building a house on sand. So we implemented plans to stabilize the financial system and revive lending to families and businesses. We passed the Recovery Act, which stopped our freefall and help spur the growth that we have seen. Today, our economy is growing again for the first time in a year and at the fastest pace that we have seen in 2 years, and productivity is surging.

Now that this leadership has emerged, we are strongly supporting its efforts to build institutions of a vibrant democratic state.

Well, I will let them determine who their standard bear is going to be. Until the Republicans have a nominee, we do not have a campaign. Right now they have to decide who it is that they want representing them. Who will be a more challenging contender for you? You know, I do not really think about that. What I can say is this. That whoever their nominee is, they represent ideas that I think are wrong for America. They believe that we should not provide a pathway to citizenship for young people who were brought here when they were very young children, and are basically American kids, but right now are still in a shadow.

I mean, the new economy, with the increase in productivity that is tied to technology and globalism, has really led the United States to sustained economic expansion that is been amazing in the decade and growth beyond just about anyone's predictions. I was just wondering if you are a believer in this new economy scenario. And then the second part was, why, if there is such a booming economy, do you think it has not trickled all the way down to some of these distressed inner cities and the rural areas? First, I do believe in the new economy. I think that technology is rifling through every sector of economic activity, in ways that have given us dramatic increases in productivity and potential for growth without inflation that I think most models have not accurately measured. And I think that, therefore, the most important thing for Government policy is to be fiscally responsible, to create the conditions in which people can prosper, and then to try to do things which will accelerate the trends that are already underway. I think that that is what we are trying to do with Internet II, for example, and what we are trying to do with having heavy investments in biomedical research. Now, why has not it trickled down to everybody? I think there are I'd like to make three points. We have the lowest minority unemployment rate, among African-Americans and Hispanics, recorded in the nearly three decades we have been doing racially separate unemployment statistics. And many cities Detroit, for example, has an unemployment rate that is roughly half what it was in '93. On the other hand, I think there are two reasons why it has not . One is, there are enormous premiums in this new economy for education and skills, so that people who do not have an education are both more likely to remain unemployed and, even more significantly, more likely to remain underemployed or relatively undercompensated, which I think explains the lion's share of why you have had increasing inequality for over 20 years, which began to abate about the last 2 or 3 years. You have begun to see comparable and, in some cases, relatively larger income gains in the lower 40 percent. I also think the wage inequality is also reinforced by the fact that people at lower income levels are less able to buy stocks, and an enormous amount of increased wealth has come from ownership as opposed to just salaried employment.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithrickdunhambusinessweek", "title": "Interview With Rick Dunham of BusinessWeek", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-rick-dunham-businessweek", "publication_date": "29-06-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

And that is what I intend to talk to President about and Angela Merkel about, and that is to keep the international pressure and to keep the focus on the ambitions of an Iranian regime that has publicly declared its intention to destroy Israel, for example, and have defied the demands of the IAEA. And so they are not trusted to be trusted with a enrichment program. We made that abundantly clear to them. And I believe we can solve this problem diplomatically. I simply do not buy into that logic or illogic, in this case. I think a free society on Iran's border is going to be make their life more difficult. I think that, ultimately, they are going to feel pressure about the type of government they have when their people look across the border and see a flourishing, free society. And so our policy is to work with friends and allies to say to the people, here is a problem, let us work collaboratively to address it, and now, early.

I can say without qualification that no Vice President in history has had so much responsibility or done so much good. So the vision requires an action. And if it had not been for Hillary, for all the good intentions in the world, we would not have done nearly as much to advance the cause of health care or child care or education or to observe the millennium.

They live in tough neighborhoods, but they have got good minds.

As you now round out your first year in the White House, do you feel at home here? Do you find that you enjoy the splendid misery of the Presidency, to use those famous words of Thomas Jefferson? It is a magnificent home, of course. It can get a little lonely at times. It is big, but there are so many wonderful things here that you can enjoy. It also gives you an opportunity to focus in on the problems, and it is the problems that come with the house that make it somewhat difficult at times to really relax and enjoy yourself. Speaking of those problems, ENTITY, I think many people regarded you as something of an interim ENTITY when you first assumed office. Do you feel now that a year later, that you have established a ENTITY Presidency? I think we have gradually put together a domestic program and a foreign policy that can be identified as a ENTITY Administration. As we move in the next 12 to 14 months, I think it will become more and more evident, which, of course, gives us an opportunity in the next election to lay that record out so the public can judge it against any alternative programs submitted by the opposition. I do not think there will be any problem in identifying what we have done, what we have tried to do, and it will be known as a ENTITY policy or a ENTITY program, so to speak.  What would you pick out as the things you have done in this first year that make it indeed a ENTITY Presidency, both in domestic and foreign policy? Before getting into foreign and domestic policy, ENTITY, I think it is entirely proper to say that I have tried to restore public confidence in the Government and, particularly, in the Administration, in the executive branch, in the White House. I do not mean to criticize anybody else, but all the polls showed that roughly a year ago there had been a great loss of confidence on the part of the American people in their Government. We, the new Administration, with our appointments, with our openness, with our attempt to be frank and honest with the American people, I think we have turned the corner, and there is a restored confidence on behalf of the American people in their Government.

So we have got a situation here which it seems to me might have been predictable at the time the deregulation legislation was done. But I, frankly, until this happened, I did not know what the nature of the California deregulation law was. So we are dealing with the situation the best we can. But I also think we need to talk to some of the producers, see whether more power can be brought on line at economical rates more quickly. I actually talked to one of them myself just in the last 2 or 3 days. So I am trying to get all of our options out there, and if there is anything else I can do, I will.

For schools that attract choice students, it will give teachers and principals a welcome source of new funds.

For too long, we have shielded schools from competition, allowed our schools a damaging monopoly power over our children. This monopoly turns students into statistics and turns parents into pawns. It is time we began thinking of a system of public education in which many providers offer a marketplace of opportunities, opportunities that give all of our children choices and access to the best education in the world. And so it is our firm belief, it is our firm belief that this GI bill for children will move America inevitably in that direction. Milwaukee is not the only place in America that our revolution is underway.

I understand a bus-load of parents and students drove all night to be here today. If you are still awake, welcome, a special welcome to all of you. In San Antonio, the CEO Foundation has earmarked $1.5 million in vouchers for children in their community. Joe Alibrandi and thousands of supporters are pushing for a ballot initiative to provide voucher scholarships for every school-age child in the State. Overall in 1991, 10 States approved some form of new choice legislation, and 37 States had choice legislation pending in one form or another. I have been told that there may just be a few folks here from Pennsylvania. The children of Pennsylvania will have school choice. From California to East Harlem, from coast to coast, the leaders of the school choice movement are sparking a revolution in American education. They are the true heroes of this education reform, and some of them are here with us today. They are not afraid to stand up to the status quo, to say loud and clear that when it comes to educating our kids, business-as-usual simply is not good enough. Barbara and I and the Vice President and Marilyn, and certainly our Secretary, are very proud to stand with you.

This milestone measure will help us to honor that commitment. This bill carries forward our continuing efforts to eradicate slums and blight in our cities; to assure decent housing for those least able to find it--the poor, the elderly, the severely handicapped-and those in our rural areas; to help our communities grow in orderly directions and avoid future blight and assure lasting beauty. This bill does more than to continue the successful programs that we have had in operation in the past. It provides new support for greater success in the future. The plight of property owners in urban renewal areas is recognized in this measure. Provision is made so that they can rehabilitate their homes and businesses instead of having to move from the path of the bulldozers. Looking ahead, this measure assists local communities in enforcing housing codes so blight does not develop or persist in the future. It also provides for training local urban development administrators and to produce the city planners that we shall need in the future to guide in the growth that we expect. This is by no means a bill just for the cities of America alone. A key new program provides for the construction of low-cost rental housing for our farmworkers in the Nation. Nor is this bill a bill solely for the housing of those that are in unfortunate circumstances. It provides expanded benefits to builders and to lenders, and to families in good circumstances. By every standard we think this bill benefits all Americans, and if we are to continue to keep our commitments in the world, then I believe it is fundamental that we must consider keeping our commitments here at home. And that is what we are trying to do with this legislation. For our generation, courage is not confined to meeting the challenges faraway from us. Courage is also required to meet the problems and the obligations and the challenges that are nearest to us. This Congress deserves, I believe, very special commendation for the foresight and the courage that it has shown in meeting our problems here at home and in our own country, with our own people.

We have to work with the Palestinians tomorrow, then we have to analyze where we are with both and whether we can go forward. And we may not make any progress at all. And if we do not , I will tell you that. I'd like to ask you, though, after spending so much time with Mr. Netanyahu on this visit and on other visits, some people regard him as a man who always opposed a land for peace settlement to the conflict with the Palestinians, certainly would not have negotiated the Oslo accords had he been in office then, has never liked them particularly. Some would say he is really trying to thwart that process and contain the damage from his standpoint. No, I cannot say that based on what I have seen. I do believe he is made no secret of the fact that he has principle differences with the Oslo process, which he has pledged to support. And we all know he has a different political coalition, and that indeed, the political forces in Israel itself are different than they were even a few years ago in terms of the composition of the population, the rise of these small parties and immigrant-related intense groups and all that. I think that, historically, there is been a little bit of difference in the kind of the texture of the relationship between the Likud Party and the Palestinians and the Labor Party and the Palestinians. But the bottom line is, I think, Mr. Netanyahu is an intelligent man who wants to make peace and understands that there has to be some formula where some marginal increase in territorial insecurity by giving up land is more than offset by a dramatic increase in security by changing the feelings of the people, the climate, the capacity for growth and opportunity.

It is a great comfort when the storms come and when you are in all kind of conflict and all this political stuff is happening in Washington the way it does, and people who are in the business or around it primarily for power are pulling back and forth-if you get up every day with a very clear idea of what you said you were going to do and what you believe the country needs, it is an unbelievable asset to America. So one good reason to be for this guy is, he actually talks about what he would do if he were President in great detail, with the benefit of a unique amount of experience. Now, this may seem self-evident to you, but you go back and look at all the Presidential campaigns in the 20th century. In New Hampshire, I knew that America was moving to this because Senator Tsongas, who was from Massachusetts next door, who won the New Hampshire primary, and I got 60 percent of the vote between us in a six-way race, and we were the only two people that put out very detailed plans of what we would do. The second thing I want to say is, what I think we should be thinking about is how we keep this thing going, first of all. What could go wrong with this economy? How do we head off the problems, maximize the opportunities? And then what are the really big challenges out there for America? Because when you have this luxury and this kind of circumstance, you ought to be going after the big challenge. What are we going to do when all the baby boomers retire and there is two people working for every one person drawing Social Security? What are we going to do when all of America looks like California-there is no majority race- and we have the biggest bunch of school kids we have ever had from all these diverse racial, ethnic, religious backgrounds and with different first languages.

So if North Korea engages in provocations, I will fully trust the judgment of our military. So if our military makes a judgment which they feel is the right thing, then they should act accordingly. And this is the instruction that I had made. And North Korea has to pay a price when it comes not only with regard to provocations, but also with regard to the recent Kaesong industrial complex issue, where, based on agreements between the two sides, companies had believed in the agreement that was made and actually went to invest in the Kaesong industrial complex, but they suddenly completely dismiss and disregard this agreement overnight and deny various medical supplies and food supplies to Korean citizens left in that industrial complex, refusing to accept our request to allow in those supplies, which is what prompted us to withdraw all of our citizens from that park. This situation unfolded in the full view of the international community. So who would invest, not to mention Korean companies, but also companies of other countries, who would invest in North Korea in a place that shows such flagrant disregard for agreements, and how could they, under those circumstances, actually pull off economic achievement?

He bought them above par. Today the average of those bonds is about 40. The result is that he has lost over half of the savings that he put into those bonds. Now, why are they selling at 40? For the simple reason that you have to find out what is behind them. That starts you back over a chain. Let us take Associated Gas & Electric, as an example, or Commonwealth & Southern, or any of the big holding companies. Those bonds have printed on them that behind them is so much stock. Let us call the first company the A Company, and its bonds state that it has so much stock of B Company, C Company, D Company, in the treasury of the A Company, as security for those bonds. Then you analyze and you ask, what is the common stock of B, C and D Companies? You will find that they are holding companies. And you will also find that they have outstanding certain bonds which are backed by the common stocks of E, F, G, H and I Companies. And then you will come down to those companies and perhaps they are operating companies or perhaps they are holding companies too.

A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Well, I would think that once-I think the weapons that are the most destabilizing are the nuclear weapons, the idea in the minds of people that once those weapons are fired devastation is going to follow and there is no way to halt them. They are more destabilizing than the people's concern about weapons that we are familiar with-airplanes, battleships, things of this kind, artillery. But then if we continue to work out our differences and a better understanding, then I think we engage in the reduction of conventional weapons. ENTITY, since we have already touched on the question of nuclear weapons, I would not like to seem pessimistic, but I get the impression that in Moscow there will hardly be an opportunity to sign a treaty about 50-percent reductions of strategic nuclear weapons while observing the ABM treaty. Still, despite that, what are your attitudes about the prospects of concluding such a very, very important treaty for the world? Well, I still think it can be concluded, but it would be, I think, overly optimistic, with the time limitations, to believe that it could be ready for signature as the INF treaty was here in the previous meeting. It would be nice if we could have achieved a signing ceremony there on this visit, but this treaty is far more technical and complicated than the treaty we did sign. And so, the experts on both sides who have been working on this in Geneva have not been able to make the progress that was made in the earlier treaty. And I think that perhaps we can advance it in our conversations, discussion, in Moscow on this. But we must-the idea is to continue until we have the treaty that is correct, and not simply try to meet a date and sign a treaty that might not be all that we would desire. I do not think either of us have gone this far with the idea that it was not a good idea. ENTITY, I'd like to ask you a sort of personal question.

In other words, you get the $1,000 now; it is going down to $700 in a couple years unless the Congress acts. You see, when we passed tax relief, I know most Americans did not expect to see higher taxes come back through the back door. I also understand for job creation, it is important to have certainty in the Tax Code. And so if Congress is really interested in job creation, they will make the tax cuts we passed permanent.

The second reason is, as Christopher Reeve so eloquently told me when we were visiting in the Oval Office, not everyone who gets a serious injury and becomes disabled is wealthy; most people are not , and even wealthy people can quickly be bankrupted by the cost of care. The Medicaid program which the Federal Government has maintained for 30 years contains a guarantee of aid to families with disabilities who are middle class or below, to enable them to maintain a middle class life, to keep their jobs, and still give their disabled family member some help. In the budget-which I vetoed-of the Republican Congress, which Senator Dole and Mr. Gingrich led through Congress, they would have removed that guarantee, just sent some money to the States, put a lid on it, and then let the States decide what to do.

I am very pleased by that, and we are on our way to meeting our goal sometime next year of having all of our schools wired and, soon after that, all of our classrooms wired. I want to thank the Vice President and all the people in various industries who have supported us and helped us in this regard. But as Secretary Daley's most recent Falling Through the Net report shows, there is still a lot more to do. We must connect all of our citizens to the Internet not just in schools and libraries but in homes, small businesses, and community centers.

But for those who follow our budget process, they know that defense has been hit 5 years in a row, and so, it is appropriate that any Secretary of Defense encourage active reviews.

When we see the scenes of destruction in the wake of terror, we see no signs that those murdered were Jewish or Christian, Shia or Sunni. When we look upon the streams of innocent blood soaked into the ancient ground, we cannot see the faith or sect or tribe of the victims - we see only that they were Children of God whose deaths are an insult to all that is holy. But we can only overcome this evil if the forces of good are united and strong - and if everyone in this room does their fair share and fulfills their part of the burden. Terrorism has spread across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land. America is prepared to stand with you - in pursuit of shared interests and common security. But the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "trumpwhitehousearchivesgovbriefingsstatementspresidenttrumpsspeecharabislamicamericansummitutmsourcelinkutmmediumheader", "title": "President Trump's Speech to the Arab Islamic American Summit", "source": "https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-trumps-speech-arab-islamic-american-summit/?utm_source=link&utm_medium=header", "publication_date": "21-05-2017", "crawling_date": "27-06-2023", "politician": ["Donald Trump"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And yet, the world's largest problem and America's largest problem, that you can see when those kids got shot at that Jewish school and that Filipino postalworker was murdered here; that you could see when that guy who said he belonged to a church that did not believe in God but did believe in white supremacy killed all those people of color and wounded others in Illinois and Indiana; that you could see when Matthew Shepard was murdered and James Byrd was torn apart; and that you can see in the tribal slaughters of Rwanda, and the persecution of the Kosovar Albanians or the Bosnian Muslims or the fights in Northern Ireland or the continued agonies of the Middle East here we are on the verge of this great modern world, where we can make movies with virtual reality now, and virtual reality seems sometimes more real than what is real, and the biggest problem we have got is the primitive, ageold fear and hatred and dehumanization of the other people who are not like us.

I think that of all ranks and all walks of life, our military people, they get caught up in actually seeing what they can do. The military is the most well-organized operation in our society, so you can only imagine the contrast between going into a war zone or a society that is totally dissolved over racial or ethnic or religious hatreds. To a little child who is used to living in chaos, seeing the United States as a symbol of both order and goodness, both things, is astonishing.

You talked about Kosovo. What are we going to do? Are we going in on the ground? Are we going to be just that 10 percent of NATO, or are we going to be the dominant force? Who is going to command people who go in on the ground? Well, first of all, unless there is an agreement between both parties, we will not go in on the ground, because we did not go in on the ground in Bosnia until we had an agreement everybody had to agree because we were a peacekeeping force, not a war force designed to win a victory and then enforce the peace. But we will defend ourselves. We will have vigorous rules of engagement if necessary to defend ourselves, just as we have had in Bosnia. And the more vigorous our right to defend ourselves, the less likely it is we will ever have to do it. But anyway, to go back to the first question, the difference in this and Bosnia is that this movement reflects the continued development within Europe of security capacity and the idea that the Europeans have that they should take the lead for their own security.

Let us stop trying to undo it, stick with what works, and balance the budget and still do our justice to the streets of Los Angeles and the other places in the United States. I could give you a lot of other examples, but let me just mention one. And you have heard all this, and the numbers are so confusing it probably makes your head hurt. Let me tell you what the basic facts are. Medicare is a program that provides health care to people over 65. Part A of Medicare is hospital care; it is funded by a payroll tax. Part B is all of the other things you get on Medicare, and it is funded by general tax money and what elderly people pay out of their own pocket. Medicaid is a program that takes care of old people on low incomes and disabled people who need nursing home care or get care in their homes, and it provides medical care for all these poor children and their parents. You know, it is not fashionable to stick up for the poor anymore, but those kids are going to grow up and be part of our country. Why do you think the Los Angeles health care system's in trouble? Because they have got a lot of poor kids to care for. Now, we need to slow the growth of both those programs. They have been growing too fast, and they are crowding out our ability to invest in education and technology and the future. Everybody knows it. And we need to make sure that the so-called Medicare Trust Fund that guarantees hospital care for the elderly is secure. And everybody knows that. The congressional majority has made a decision that in order to balance the budget in 7 years and get $250 billion in tax cuts, they have to take $450 billion out of the health care system over the next 7 years that we thought they were going to have to spend.

So the question is, after those 6 years, if they get the 6 years in this program, how will you enforce sending people back who have to go back who have been living-- Well, you will have to have a tamper-proof card in order to work.

But people should not -it is impractical to fence off the border. But it is also realistic to give our Border Patrol agents tools to be able to do their job. We ought to enforce our borders. That is what the American people expect. I have talked to President Fox about Mexico enforcing her southern border, and he agrees there ought to be border enforcement down there. But he, like I, understand it is difficult to enforce large borders. And I do not think anybody believes that you could totally fence off the border and be effective. But I do think we ought to be in a position to give our Border Patrol agents better tools, more effective ways to prevent people from smuggling people and/or drugs across our border.

It is no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last 2 years. The debates have been contentious; we have fought fiercely for our beliefs. That is what a robust democracy demands. That is what helps set us apart as a nation. But there is a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause. Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater, something more consequential than party or political preference. We are part of the American family. We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found, we are still bound together as one people, that we share common hopes and a common creed, that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children, that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled. That too is what sets us apart as a nation. Now, by itself, this simple recognition will not usher in a new era of cooperation. What comes of this moment is up to us. What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight, but whether we can work together tomorrow. That is what the people who sent us here expect of us. With their votes, they have determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties. New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans. We will move forward together or not at all, for the challenges we face are bigger than party and bigger than politics. At stake right now is not who wins the next election. After all, we just had an election. At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country or somewhere else. It is whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded. It is whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just a place on a map, but the light to the world. We are poised for progress.

He wants a partner in the battle on terror, not somebody who will say they are going to fight terror and then turn a blind eye to terror, somebody who wants to join him. And that is one of the things that came clear. It should have been clear in my speech, too, that we will fight terror. And security is-we will never compromise on Israel's security.

Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror organization carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans. Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. And we know that Iraq is continuing to finance terror and gives assistance to groups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace. We know that Iraq and the Al Qaida terrorist network share a common enemy- the United States of America. We know that Iraq and Al Qaida have had high-level contacts that go back a decade. Some Al Qaida leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq. These include one very senior Al Qaida leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year, and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks. We have learned that Iraq has trained Al Qaida members in bombmaking and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September the 11th, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America. Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists. Alliance with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints. Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war against terror. When I spoke to Congress more than a year ago, I said that those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. Saddam Hussein is harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror, the instruments of mass death and destruction. The risk is simply too great that he will use them or provide them to a terror network. Terror cells and outlaw regimes building weapons of mass destruction are different faces of the same evil. Our security requires that we confront both, and the United States military is capable of confronting both. Many people have asked how close Saddam Hussein is to developing a nuclear weapon. Before the Gulf war, the best intelligence indicated that Iraq was 8 to 10 years away from developing a nuclear weapon.

The truth is that the Mexicans expanded too quickly, borrowed too much money, and got in trouble. But now, under President Zedillo, they are slowly working their way back into a stable situation. Over the long run, NAFTA means more opportunities for Americans to sell products that bring higher wages to our workers, it means more stability in Mexico, it means less illegal immigration, it means better partnerships in Mexico and in Canada and then throughout Latin America for the long run. We have to make these decisions in this period of change not just on what might be good next month but on what will be good for America 10 or 20 or 30 years from now, and I am convinced that NAFTA and the GATT world trade agreement will be very good for America over the long run.

One of the things that I think we learned from that war is that even when we are extremely well-motivated, heroic, and willing to die in large numbers, we cannot win a fight for someone else. We can support other people on their own land fighting for their own destiny, but we cannot win a fight for someone else. There are limits to what we can do. And the enormous reaction after that war happened and after the South Vietnamese forces collapsed 10 days after our final withdrawal almost caused our country to go into a shell for a while.

And the American ENTITY. can help move the process forward by reminding friends and allies in the Middle East about the importance of the two-state solution and what they can do to help. And the third thing, of course, is to spend time talking about the strategic implications of a U.S. presence in a way that bolsters governments and, at the same time, helps serve as a bulwark against aggressive regimes such as Iran. And so it is a multifaceted agenda that I am really looking forward to carrying on there in the Middle East. do you see a chance to sign a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the First of all, the I envision Israel and Palestine sitting down at a table, signing this is what a state would look like, subject to the roadmap.

Well, actually we did a lot of that, but we did not have our war room set up, and we were, frankly, just overwhelmed by the day-to-day news coverage of Republicans carping about taxes and unable to kind of break through about what the facts of the program were. I worked hard-for 2 months after I made my State of the Union Address I went out into the country once a week. I did my best to talk about the program. But we did not have the kind of organized disciplined effort we have had for the last few weeks in reaching out to local newspapers and television and radio stations and bringing in opinion leaders and doing all these things we are doing now. And I think we did lose control of the debate. Also, to be fair to them, to Roger Altman and the others, an issue like this tends to go through cycles. I told the people about it on February 17th, and they liked it. Then the sort of negative rhetoric took over. Now we are kind of coming back to reality, and all the surveys show we are bringing it back our way now. ENTITY, Alan Greenspan has been giving some subliminal signals about raising interest rates. Would not that sort of derail your plan for reducing the deficit if the interest rates went up? And are you worried about that? I do not think you should raise interest rates until there is real economic growth that brings on real inflation. I mean, there is no real inflation in this economy, and we can have growth without inflation. And I think we may be reading too much into his remarks. Have you talked to him directly about what he did mean since he made those remarks? No, but I talk to him fairly often, and I am scheduled to have another session with him pretty soon. I know him pretty well, and my read on what he said was if inflation warranted it, he might raise interest rates. But if you think about it, what we are trying to do in bringing the deficit down is to justify keeping the interest rates down even when there is economic growth because the Federal Government will be taking less capital away from the markets, and therefore, there will not be as much competition for it, and we ought to be able to keep lower interest rates.

And, in part because of some of those changes in practices, we saw, last year, for the first time in 40 years, a drop in both the number of people incarcerated and the crime rate. I think what we have seen is the possibility, now, of having a - a broader public conversation, and this is one area where I have been pleasantly surprised to see some bipartisan interest.

{"id": 5432, "text": "There are a number of ways by which the Federal Government can meet its responsibilities to aid economic growth. We can and must improve American education and technical training. We can and must expand civilian research and technology. One of the great bottlenecks for this country's economic growth in this decade will be the shortage of doctorates in mathematics, engineering, and physics; a serious shortage with a great demand and an under-supply of highly trained manpower. We can and must step up the development of our natural resources. But the most direct and significant kind of Federal action aiding economic growth is to make possible an increase in private consumption and investment demand to cut the fetters which hold back private spending. In the past, this could be done in part by the increased use of credit and monetary tools, but our balance of payments situation today places limits on our use of those tools for expansion. It could also be done by increasing Federal expenditures more rapidly than necessary, but such a course would soon demoralize both the Government and our economy. If Government is to retain the confidence of the people, it must not spend more than can be justified on grounds of national need or spent with maximum efficiency. I shall say more on this in a moment. The final and best means of strengthening demand among consumers and business is to reduce the burden on private income and the deterrents to private initiative which are imposed by our present tax system; and this administration pledged itself last summer to an across-the-board, top-to-bottom cut in personal and corporate income taxes to be enacted and become effective in 1963. I am not talking about a quickie or a temporary tax cut, which would be more appropriate if a recession were imminent. Nor am I talking about giving the economy a mere shot in the arm, to ease some temporary complaint. I am talking about the accumulated evidence of the last 5 years that our present tax system, developed as it was, in good part, during World War II to restrain growth, exerts too heavy a drag on growth in peace time; that it siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power; that it reduces the financial incentives for personal effort, investment, and risk-taking. In short, to increase demand and lift the economy, the Federal Government's most useful role is not to rush into a program of excessive increases in public expenditures, but to expand the incentives and opportunities for private expenditures.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressandquestionandanswerperiodtheeconomicclubnewyork", "title": "Address and Question and Answer Period at the Economic Club of New York.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-and-question-and-answer-period-the-economic-club-new-york", "publication_date": "14-12-1962", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["John F.

I am most proud of the performance of our troops. We have asked a lot of our military and the military families. We have got men and women who have been to both theaters in the war on terror, multiple times. On the other hand, our troops know it is necessary. I am focused on making sure that we do not allow the sacrifice that has gone over the last 5 years to go in vain; that we end up making the hard decisions now, and helping the Iraqis now to develop a peaceful and free society in the heart of the Middle East, which will enable the next generation's children to grow up in a peaceful world or the next generation to grow up in a peaceful world.

It is a tough issue for the Prime Minister; I understand that, and it is a tough issue for me.

We have just got to continue to come up with an agreement that both of us can live with. But the relationship is broader than just the civilian nuclear issue. I have told the American people, we want India to develop a civilian nuclear power program. We are all, kind of, connected globally, particularly when it comes to the price of energy. And the more nuclear power used by great emerging democracies and economies like India, the better off we will all be. Well, there is an impression, as reflected in the U.S. media, that you are surrendering your interests while proposing to supply civilian nuclear technology to India. What do you tell them?

First, let me say I think the G-7 meeting will be a very important opportunity for the leaders of the major industrialized countries of the world to reaffirm their commitment to global growth, to democracy, and to security concerns. I believe there will be serious discussions about three issues on the economic front, one really perhaps for the first time. The first is that I think there will be a real discussion about how we can coordinate our economic policies in ways that will produce growth. From the first week I was in office, we have spent a lot of time working through the finance ministers, the foreign ministers, and others to talk about how we can coordinate our strategies. For many years, other nations have asked the United States, for example, to lower the budget deficit. And we are working very hard on that, first through this $500 billion deficit reduction program that has now been passed by both Houses of our Congress, then through taking on a health care problem which is the biggest source of our growing deficit. And we need to make sure we are coordinating those policies with things which will produce an overall higher level of growth than we now have. It is a big problem for the United States, because two-thirds of the new jobs we have created here in the last 5 years have come from increased trade with other nations. The second issue I think that we will discuss and, I hope, make some genuine progress on, creating a more open trading system and increasing the chances that we can successfully conclude GATT by the end of the year. The third thing that I hope to see a very serious discussion on is the microeconomic policies of each of our nations and how we can all do a better job of creating jobs within our economy. Even Japan, with its very low unemployment rate by western standards, is having some trouble now creating new jobs. But it is a very big problem for the United States and for every other country represented around this room today.

Muskie has captured for himself a place in the public eye and the public's heart. Devoted to his nation and our ideals, he has performed heroically in a time of great challenge, with great fortitude in an era of change. If Ed were going to rewrite this citation, he would certainly insert the word Governor. I remember when we had the swearing-in ceremony in this room not too long ago, Ed pointed out that his love for the Governorship equaled my own, and I think those who have served in that position would agree that this is a wonderful opportunity for service before one comes to Washington to serve our whole Nation. Ed Muskie has been a man whom I have admired ever since I have been aware of his public service and been interested myself in going into the political arena. He has performed all of his official functions admirably with a quiet sense of inner strength and demonstrated courage. He has never yielded to temptation to lower his own standards or the standards which make all public servants proud. He is a man who has transcended in all his service any particular delineation of a political party, but has stayed a loyal Democrat at the same time. He is a man admired by all and the admiration is richly deserved. I am particularly grateful to Ed Muskie, because he was willing to leave a sure seat in the Senate to come and serve in a very difficult position as Secretary of State in this time of transition or change.

He is a personal friend, as many of these honorees are, and personally and as President of our country, I am delighted and proud to award the Medal of Freedom to Ed Muskie. Once government's highest ranking woman, Esther Peterson still ranks highest among consumer advocates. She has advised Presidents and the public, and has worked for labor and business alike, always keeping the rights of all Americans to know and to be treated fairly as her highest priority.

You know, I gave a speech the other day at Calvin College, and I talked about Alexis de Tocqueville. He had interesting observations about America in 1832. He talked about the strength of America being in the souls of our citizens and that people were able to find great comfort and solace and strength through civic organizations, voluntary organizations where people come together to help heal the hurts of society. That was true in 1832, and it is darn sure true today in 2005. The strength of this country lies in the hearts and souls of our citizens. And the Federal Government should not fear should not fear the presence of faith to help deal with social problems, as a matter of fact, ought to welcome faith programs and to help deal with social problems. I appreciate Jim's willingness to join me in promoting a culture of life in America. I want to thank Jim for helping defend the institution of marriage from being redefined by activist judges. And speaking about judges I want to thank both Senators from Missouri for understanding that every nominee a President sends up must have a fair hearing in the Judiciary Committee, an expeditious hearing in the Judiciary Committee and then an up-or-down vote on the floor of the United States Senate. I nominated a fantastic woman named Priscilla Owen over 4 years ago to the bench, Fifth Court. She is a fantastic lady, tops in her law school class. In our State, you got to run for Supreme Court, and she ran for Supreme Court, got endorsed by Republicans and Democrats, won something like 80 percent of the State because she is a great judge. For 4 long years her nomination was held up for pure partisan reasons 4 years and finally, as a result of never giving up and being steadfast and strong, she got her vote. I want to thank Senators Talent and Bond for supporting this great woman. We got another confirmation that needs to get done too. It is time for the United States Senate to stop playing pure politics, stall politics, and give John Bolton an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. People look at the Government and say, What is going on with all this filibustering? Why cannot people come together and do what is right for the country?

We seek concrete progress toward an available plan with tangible commitments that would increase stability on the peninsula and in the region, as well as improve the lives of the people in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We must also remain vigilant to the threat of terror, that terrorism poses to all our nations. We know the bitter string of terrorism. The bitter sting of terrorism is real. We have almost all experienced it. Last month, we lost 13 American heroes and almost 200 innocent Afghan civilians in a heinous terrorist attack at Kabul airport. Those who commit acts of terrorism against us will continue to find a determined enemy in the United States. The world today is not the world of 2001 though, and the United States is not the same country we were when we were attacked on 9/11, 20 years ago. Today, we are better equipped to detect, to prevent terrorist threats and we are more resilient in our ability to repel them and to respond. We know how to build effective partnerships to dismantle terrorist networks by targeting their financing and support systems, countering their propaganda, preventing their travel as well as disrupting imminent attacks. We will meet terrorist threats that arise today and the future with a full range of tools available to us, including working in cooperation with local partners so that we need not be so reliant on large scale military deployments. One of the most important ways we can effectively enhance security and reduce violence is by seeking to improve the lives of the people all over the world, who see that their governments are not serving their needs. Corruption fuels inequality, siphons off a nation's resources, spreads across borders and generates human suffering. It is nothing less than a national security threat in the 21st century. Around the world, we are increasingly seeing citizens demonstrate their discontent. Seeing the wealthy and well connected grow richer and richer, taking payoffs and bribes, operating above the law while the vast majority of the people struggle to find a job or put food on the table or to get their businesses off the ground, or simply send their children to school.

That is a portrait of the future if we do not do something now. It is going to keep on beating down families, small businesses, large businesses. It is going to be a huge drain on the economy. We are going to have to do something about it, and I think we can. So you are inviting Republicans here to the White House. Does that mean, ENTITY, you are willing to start at square one? Well, I think that what I want to do is to look at the Republican ideas that are out there. How do you guys want to lower costs? How do you guys intend to reform the insurance market so people with pre-existing conditions, for example, can get health care? How do you want to make sure that the 30 million people who do not have health insurance can get it? And if we can go step by step through a series of these issues and arrive at some agreements, then procedurally there is no reason why we cannot do it a lot faster than the process took last year. In retrospect, do you wish you had waited on health care until the economy grew stronger? No, because, keep in mind, jobs were my number one priority last year.

It is a day of deep and purposeful meaning in the lives of all of us. For on this day we Americans proclaim the vitality of our history, the singleness of our will and the unity of our nation. We prepare to keep the peace in this New World which free men have built for free men to live in. The United States, a nation of one hundred and thirty million people, has today only about five hundred thousand-half a million officers and men in ENTITY and National Guard. Other nations, smaller in population, have four and five and six million trained men in their armies. Our present program will train eight hundred thousand additional men this coming year and somewhat less than one million men each year thereafter. It is a program obviously of defensive preparation and of defensive preparation only. Calmly, without fear and without hysteria, but with clear determination, we are building guns and planes and tanks and ships-and all the other tools which modern defense requires. We are mobilizing our citizenship, for we are calling on men and women and property and money to join in making our defense effective. Today's registration for training and service is the keystone in the arch of our national defense. In the days when our forefathers laid the foundation of our democracy, every American family had to have its gun and know how to use it. Today we live under threats, threats of aggression from abroad, which call again for the same readiness, the same vigilance. Ours must once again be the spirit of those who were prepared to defend as they built, to defend as they worked, to defend as they worshipped. The duty of this day has been imposed upon us from without. Those who have dared to threaten the whole world with war-those who have created the name and deed of total war-have imposed upon us and upon all free peoples the necessity of preparation for total defense.

Here, government derived its just powers from the consent of the governed. Here men believed passionately in freedom, independence-the God-given right of the individual to be his own master. Yet, with all of this freedom-I insist-because of this freedom-ours was a land of plenty. In a fashion unequalled anywhere else in the world, America grew and strengthened; our standard of living became the envy of the world. In all lands, men and women looked toward America as the pattern of what they, themselves, desired. And because we were what we were, good will flowed toward us from all corners of the earth. An American was welcomed everywhere and looked upon with admiration and regard. At times, we had our troubles; made our share of mistakes; but we faltered only to go forward with renewed vigor. It remained for the past eleven years, under the present national administration, for continuing unemployment to be accepted with resignation as the inevitable condition of a nation past its prime. It is the New Deal which tells us that America has lost its capacity to grow. We shall never build a better world by listening to those counsels of defeat. Is America old and worn out as the New Dealers tell us? Look to the reaches of the wide Pacific-to the corners of the world where American men are fighting. our country is just fighting its way through to new horizons. The future of America has no limit. True, we now pass through dark and troubled times, scarcely a home escapes the touch of dread anxiety and grief; yet in this hour the American spirit rises, faith returns-faith in our God, faith in our fellowman, faith in the land our fathers died to win, faith in the future, limitless and bright, of this, our country.

It is not easy to break habits of gridlock that, frankly, are the province not just of the other party, which says no a lot of the time, but of the cumbersome procedures which grip Washington.

And I want to say a special word of welcome to Congressman Bud Cramer of Alabama, who has supported the 100,000 police program. We thank you, sir, for your presence here. This is an important time for us to be making this announcement because the holiday season is always focused on our children, and properly so. I want our children to be at the center of our attention every day, every week, all year long. Today we come here to talk about new actions to help millions of children who are exposed every year to violence, either as witnesses or victims. For many, many of them, it is very difficult to be a child because there is too much violence, too much cruelty, too much incivility. Children experience these things in our society at younger and younger ages. That is why we have worked hard-the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, and others in our administration-to strengthen families, to bring safety and order to our schools, our communities, our streets. We passed a crime bill with tougher penalties and more prevention. We have enforced zero tolerance for guns in schools, expelling more than 6,000 students in 1997 who brought weapons to schools. We have expanded and want to continue to expand after-school programs to keep children off the streets during the after-school hours when juvenile crime soars. We do have- the chief mentioned the 100,000 police program, the community policing program. We have now funded about 91,000 of those 100,000 police. We are ahead of schedule and under budget, and I hope we can keep going. With these efforts and with the efforts of countless parents and teachers, principals, judges, police officers, and others, real progress is being made, as you have heard.

Maybe other countries do not have this problem because every other Western democracy has the loser pays rule in order to discourage senseless lawsuits. Maybe it is because we have most of the world's lawyers here in America. Maybe it is because the pop culture in this country encourages lawsuits.

But you are either going to have to find tons of people like that; or you are going to have to find ways to finance the education of young people to do this work for 4 or 5 years and just recognize you are only going to have them for 4 or 5 years; or you are going to have to have, like in junior and senior year at least, have people who have this knowledge come in and teach a course just like a-someone would come into a college and teach one course. In other words, we are going to have to be, I think, flexible if we want to lift the level of performance in America above where it is now, because we have a lot of poor kids, a lot of poor school districts, very diverse student body, and a huge number of kids. I mean, most of these places that are doing very well have a much more-either a more homogenous or smaller, or both, student body and a system that is much more nationalized and much easier to control. Could you just tell me a couple things about-how do you feel about, right now, about why NASA, which you are very enthused about, continues to get a sort of flat budget? Is this a wise thing at this point? Well, first of all, I think that NASA, when I took office, needed to show that it knew how to economize and could be managed better. I think Dan Goldin has done that. I think they have proved that they can do more with less. I mean, they got the space station up 3 years ahead of time.

One of my proudest accomplishments as President is the people I have appointed to serve in this administration. If you look at the top positions in the White House and the Cabinet today, you will see the most able, talented group ever assembled. These appointees also happen to make up the most diverse administration in the history of our Republic. If you look at our nominations to the Federal bench, you will see that a higher percentage of them have been rated well qualified by the American Bar Association than in any previous administration since these rankings have been made. A majority of those appointees are people of color and women, not a minority but a majority for the first time ever. None of these people were chosen because they were African-American or Hispanic or Asian-American or American Indian or because they were women. They were selected because they were the best qualified for the job. And they are proof that the American dream is still alive and within reach of those who choose to pursue it. Still, we cannot ignore the burdens and barriers that prevent too many of our people from moving forward in their lives still today. It is our job to renew the American dream. I sought the Presidency because I was worried that our country was going in the wrong direction. The deficit was going up; the economy was on the decline. Washington was placing heavier and heavier burdens on the backs of middle class Americans, and we were coming apart when we ought to be coming together. I believed then and I believe now that our job in this time is to restore the economy, rebuild our sense of community, empower individuals to take responsibility for their own lives, and put Government on the side of ordinary Americans. In just 18 months we have begun to renew that American dream. Our economic strategy will produce the smallest Federal bureaucracy in 30 years and 3 years in a row of deficit reduction for the first time since Harry Truman was President, while providing tax cuts for 15 million working American families and millions of small businesses. What is been the result of this economic strategy? Well, the economy has created 3.8 million new jobs; inflation is the lowest in two decades. Just today we have seen more evidence that this strategy is working. Today's report shows that the gross domestic product of the United States grew at a very impressive rate of 3.7 percent in the last quarter while inflation remained low.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsteleconferenceremarksandquestionandanswersessionwiththeunity94convention", "title": "Teleconference Remarks and a Question-and-Answer Session With the Unity '94 Convention in Atlanta, Georgia", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/teleconference-remarks-and-question-and-answer-session-with-the-unity-94-convention", "publication_date": "29-07-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

I thought it was a really great moment when the head of Lithuania got involved and encouraged the whole world to take notice of the freedom movement in the Ukraine. And by the way, that is a- the second election was a really important moment in the liberty movement. And I thanked him for that, genuinely so. I thank him for that. Lithuania serves as a great example of what is possible. After years of being subjugated to harsh rule, the Lithuanians are now free, and they are showing they can grow the economy and that people have a chance to express themselves and there is a vibrant society when you are free. And it has been hard; the transition from communism to a free democracy is a hard transition. And it is very important for the Lithuanians and the Government to share that experience with others who will be going through the same thing. And so I am very proud of Lithuania, and I am proud to call her friend. ENTITY, you showed a strong support for democracy cause in Belarus. And what is your administration planning to do, given the fact that Belarus Presidential election is planned next year? Well, first of all, we will work with you, countries in the neighborhood, countries around-the free countries of the world, to insist there be free elections and make sure there is free elections. This is the last remaining dictatorship in Europe. And Condi Rice was in the neighborhood recently, as you know, Secretary of State Rice, and she brought up the subject. She met with people who are embracing the freedom movement in Belarus. I did as well, when I was in Slovakia. And so one of the roles that the United States can play is to speak clearly about the need for Belarus to be free and to work with people to insist that Belarus be free and, when the elections come, make sure the elections are free and have monitors and international observers. As you know, that made a big difference in the Ukraine, for example. No, it is -and I think-listen, I believe everybody wants to be free, and I believe if the world works together to achieve that, many people will be free.

If it is going to be frozen, then clearly that is grounds for talking. But we have to know what the facts are, and we will be attempting to determine that. ENTITY, moving to matters closer at home now, yesterday on Meet the Press Senator Moynihan, chairman of the Finance Committee, said that there was no chance that Congress will pass a health care plan that will give all Americans immediate insurance coverage.

It is going to take some time for the States and for others who would have to provide the insurance who do not now to phase it in. But I think the important thing is that we should not walk away from this Congress without a commitment to cover everyone. The so-called 91 percent solution, if it is a permanent solution, essentially would guarantee what we have now. The poor would get health care; the wealthy would get health care; the middle class would be at risk of losing it. One in ten Americans would not have any health care all the time, and others would be losing it. Keep in mind, we now have 3 million more Americans without health insurance than we had 3 years ago. The situation in terms of coverage is getting worse, more and more middle class Americans at risk. All I want to do is to give the American people what the President and the Congress and the Federal Government employees have. And my proposal would cost small businesses much, much less than the last minimum wage increase that President Bush signed. Now, I admit that we needed to make some changes in our original proposal. They reflect some changes that we have agreed to. But we have to cover all Americans.

Let me give you this statistic, if I might. There are about 140 million licensed automobile drivers in this country and there is approximately 270 million gallons of gasoline a day, which means that if you divide the number of drivers into the availability of gasoline, it means about a gallon and a half per person per day, or about 9 gallons per week, or 36 gallons per month. And that is a cutback from the average of 50 gallons at the present time, because we have to save that much. Now, how many people can get along on a gallon and a half of gasoline, or 9 gallons a week? So, when you look at the impracticabilities the inequities, in my judgment-gas rationing would not work. ENTITY, you have obviously done your homework on the gas rationing question, but I do not think that anyone in Congress is proposing only gas rationing, but perhaps the combination of gas rationing and other factors. The question still is, if you are willing to change your program and to let Congress go into it, where are you willing to let Congress change it? Well, I think you can find some options, for example, in the most dire necessity of having to put a lid on the actual imports. In other words, if we take in from foreign sources as we are today about 7 million barrels a day of foreign oil, if a conservation program like I have proposed does not work, then I think we might have to move to arbitrary allocations. ENTITY, do you blame people for being skeptical about your plan, given the record of your advisers in the economy and other areas? It was not very long ago that people around here were wearing WIN buttons and talking about 5-percent tax surcharges, for instance. So, can you blame the American public and Congress for being more than a little skeptical that this one will work out just as you say it will? I think there is always room for some difference of opinion, and I must say that I do not contend that my proposal is 100 percent right, because the options that I had to look at there were some honest differences of opinion.

It obviously changed the fact that I knew that my time as the ENTITY would be dedicated to winning the war on terror and protecting our homeland. This is I keep telling people this it is just a different type of war, because much of the movement of the enemy is invisible to the American people and/or to the world. The killers on September the 11th had been in our country for a period of time. It was hard to tell that they were part of this unbelievably evil plot. And it we are concerned that another group are here or somewhere, not only here but in other countries in Europe. And so the task is an all-consuming task of protecting our homeland and making sure we do everything we can here to find out if anybody is here and who they are and disrupt their plans and, at the same time, hunt down their leaders. The wars of the past had known battlefields, and it was clear that such-and-such had to happen. This is a hunt for individuals. We are chasing down one person at a time. They were foolishly collected up at one point in time in the Shahi-Kot Mountains, and it was a tough chore. But our brave soldiers, along with coalition soldiers, were able to go in and score great success at bringing them to justice, as I like to put it. They are wise to our ways. They realize we are a heck of a lot tougher than they thought. They assumed America was a weak country, that we did not really believe anything. And so I realized after 9/11, after I got over the grief, along with everybody else in our country, that this was a long, very important struggle.

Yes, certainly, we discussed this question with ENTITY many years ago and agreed that it is critically important that we as Africans should, indeed, take responsibility for the future of peace and stability on the continent.

In his State of the Union address, the President laid out his belief that the middle class is the engine of economic growth in our country. jobs, skills, and opportunity. We need to build on the progress we have made over the last four years, and that means investing in those areas that are already creating good-paying, stable jobs that can support a middle-class family.

I wanted to get the White House's response to what is happening in Turkey right now, particularly Erdogan questioning the legitimacy of the protestors in what seems to be an increased police reaction to those protests. We continue to follow the events in Turkey closely and with concern. As we stated from the outset last week, the United States supports full freedom of expression and assembly, including the right to peaceful protest, as fundamental to any democracy. We believe that the vast majority of the protestors have been peaceful, law-abiding, ordinary citizens exercising their rights. The United States has serious concerns about the reports of excessive use of force by police and large numbers of injuries and damage to property. We call on these events to be investigated and to urge all parties to refrain from provoking violence. Has the President spoken with Erdogan since these protests started? I have no calls to report. I refer you to the State Department for any outreach that they might have had with the Turks, but no calls from here to report. And just more broadly, given Turkey is important to so many of the issues that the U.S. deals with in that part of the world, how key is stability in Turkey to the President? And look, all democracies have issues that they need to work through and we would expect the government to work through this in a way that respects the rights of their citizens.

Now we must again come together to affirm the inherent humanity that unites us is much greater than any outward divisions or disagreements. We must choose to do more than we think we can do alone, so that we accomplish what we must together.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptsjoebidenungeneralassemblyspeechtranscriptclimateagendacovid19vaccines", "title": "Joe Biden UN General Assembly Speech Transcript: Climate Agenda, COVID-19 Vaccines", "source": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-un-general-assembly-speech-transcript-climate-agenda-covid-19-vaccines", "publication_date": "21-09-2021", "crawling_date": "29-06-2023", "politician": ["Joe Biden"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 361, "text": "And that is why coming into this summit hosted by the United Kingdom, the President and Prime Minister staked out the agenda for the summit in that op-ed this morning. With respect to the subject of last year versus this year, first of all, I will leave it to the United Kingdom to define their efforts in this space. Clearly, Prime Minister Cameron has engaged his parliament in discussions of the threat. And so you saw him put forward a presentation about the threat that ISIL poses. He has not made decisions about things like airstrikes. That is something that they will have to review as they consider the different ways in which they can contribute to this effort. But clearly, he is engaged in that discussion here. And I think that there is a unique nature to this situation given the fact that you have foreign fighters from -- including from the United Kingdom, who have been with ISIL in Syria and in Iraq. And tragically, you have heard the Brits confirm that they believe a British national was involved in these barbaric beheadings of the two Americans that we tragically lost. That speaks to the fact that this is a threat that could potentially impact them, as well as the people of Syria and Iraq, just as it could potentially impact U.S. interests and the United States. In terms of last year, it is always worth noting that, look, the United States made clear our willingness to use military force. On the specific issue of chemical weapons, the United Kingdom and France joined with us in that determination. But at the end of the day, with that threat on the table, the Syrian regime went from denying it had chemical weapons to agreeing to remove them, and their declared weapons have since been destroyed. This is a different beast because it is been a threat of terrorism that crosses two borders -- it is Syria and Iraq -- and that could pose a threat beyond those countries. And that is what illuminates the discussion here at NATO. ENTITY could I just add on that one -- on ISIL. One thing that is amazed me as an American living in Europe is that they are seized with this question of the potential of returning foreign fighters from ISIL and other extremist groups in the Syria-Iraq theater back to Europe.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstherecordconferencecallpresssecretaryjoshearnestdeputynationalsecurityadvisor", "title": "Barack Obama On-the-Record Conference Call by Press Secretary Josh Earnest, Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes, and U.S. Ambassador to NATO Doug Lute on the President's Meetings at the NATO Summit", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-record-conference-call-press-secretary-josh-earnest-deputy-national-security-advisor", "publication_date": "04-09-2014", "crawling_date": "04-07-2023", "politician": ["Josh Earnest"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And no one ever wants to walk away from a job unfinished. If there was to be a second Reagan administration, a second term, what would be your central purpose in it? What would you want most to accomplish in that second term? To continue on the same economic path to where we did have not only just a recovery but a return to a growth economy in this country. To continue what I think we have started, and that is a real, viable search for peace, particularly by way of disarmament. And that is the goal above all that-must meet. I remember as a small boy the war to end all wars, World War I. But I also remember coming out of World War II and coming out of uniform with the firm conviction, this must never happen again. And I still have that conviction. We have only begun in the area of trying to better international relations and bring about reduction of armaments, and particularly a reduction of nuclear weapons, and, hopefully, one day, the total elimination of them. There are things like reforms in our budgetary system, the adoption of constitutional amendments to require a balanced budget as so many of our States do, line-item veto power for a ENTITY to help curb spending and keep it under control. There are things of that kind that I have not fallen back from or retreated from and we still have not made much progress with. When you took office, some of those things that you mentioned were items like the line-item veto, which you have in Sacramento.

Those in the jails, 90 percent are high school dropouts; 92 percent are functionally illiterate. The question of lack of education can breed the crime thing. Senator Bradley put an article in the Post this week about proposals to reduce guns. Just briefly, he says that we should ban the distribution and sale of Saturday Night Specials, registration for all 65 million handguns, a licensing and safety course for everyone who owns guns, ban gun dealers from selling guns in residential neighborhoods, insist on mandatory gun locks. Are these commonsense measures from your point of view? You know, we have got the gun locks provision in the Congress, and that still might pass. But I have said, we ought to have registration. We register our cars. If your car gets stolen while you are doing this interview with me, and somebody drives it halfway across the country and leaves it in a parking lot let us say in Lincoln, Nebraska and the police find it, as soon as you report your car stolen, it will go into an international computer system. As soon as he, the person who finds your car in Lincoln, Nebraska, says, Here, I have found this stolen car, and here is the license plate and the registration, within 30 seconds, the local police in Chicago will be able to call you and say, Reverend Jackson, we found your car. And so, of course we should do these things.  And I think it is interesting I think the NRA ought to support this.

And that requires coordination and it requires strategy. And I assume that these conversations will be focused on that effort. Going back to ENTITY's line of questioning, you have Alice Friend, who is the Director of African Affairs, talking about some of her frustrations, frustrations on the part of the United States with the Nigerian government's slow to adapt with new strategies and new tactics. Can you flesh out what some of the other frustrations are that the U.S. feels in terms of working with the government of Nigeria? Well, look, I think that the challenge that Nigeria faces from this group is a serious one, and there are all sorts of issues that she and others have identified that make the challenge even greater and that we try to address as a friend of Nigeria in the assistance that we provide. That is why we provide security assistance, to increase Nigeria's capacity to meet the threat, including by helping professionalize its military and helping it carry out responsible counterterrorism operations. It is why we provide law enforcement assistance, to help Nigeria bring those responsible for attacks on civilians to justice. It is why we support programs and initiatives that are aimed at combating violent extremist ideology, including by creating economic alternatives for those vulnerable to being recruited by terrorist organizations. So we have a coordinated effort that is designed to help strengthen Nigeria's ability to respond responsibly and effectively to these challenges in a way that ensures civilians are protected and human rights are respected.

His lawyers -- Donald Trump's lawyers -- have been thrown out of more than 60 courtrooms by state and federal judges, some of them appointed by President Trump himself, saying that there was no evidence that there was fraud. They did not actually vote, they were dead, but people cast ballots on behalf of them. Four people out of 5 million and one of those cast a vote for Donald Trump. But President Trump continues to say that there were dead people voting all over the United States of America. The Associated Press did a review of all those swing states that I was mentioning earlier, and they found that if you just looked at the disputed ballots -- so these are not even fraudulent ballots, because they have not been identified as fraudulent, they are just disputed ballots -- that in all these cases, the disputed ballots came to about .15% of the margin in any one of these races. In other words, in not a single one of these swing states where there is a dispute that President Trump has brought, would it make a material difference, even if it were true, what you are alleging. And he is still doubled down on the big lie. And the result of that is, as my colleagues have said here today, there are more than 400 bills nationwide, in the name of that big lie, making it harder for the American people to vote, making it harder for them to register, making it harder for people to vote early, or to vote by mail. In Texas, they are down to one dropbox per county. In Colorado, I can practically cross my street and vote at a dropbox. This is an effort to subvert elections to cling to power. And it is based on a massive falsehood -- the big lie. I think one needs to ask oneself, even people that support President Trump, what future does the stop the steal movement imagine for our country? What future do they imagine for this democracy where every election is going to be contested? Where political violence replaces the ballot box.

About $40 billion will be injected into our economy over the next 3 months in terms of rebates. So that should help bolster consumer activity. Secondly, the Fed has continued to act to cut rates. And whether they will or not in the future is up to Mr. Greenspan. It is an independent part of our Government. But nevertheless, I can safely say to our partners, we are taking steps necessary to make sure our economy recovers, and that includes, by the way, addressing energy. And needless to say, we had a very frank discussion about energy in my last trip to Europe, and I suspect we will have another frank discussion about energy. One of the things-the Prime Minister of Canada and I have had a very interesting relationship, and one that will continue to grow, is over energy. He knows full well- and Canada, by the way, is now the largest supplier of energy to the United States, and there are some great opportunities for us to enhance natural gas deliverability into our country by cooperating in our own hemisphere . My only point is that I will assure my friends and our trading partners that we are doing our part to strengthen our economy, but we have got to work to make sure we reduce trade barriers in order for prosperity to continue. The dollar is what it is based upon market. And the reason I say that is, our Government will not artificially enter markets. The market decides the strength of the dollar. And I would urge other countries, now, to do the same thing. A strong dollar has got, obviously, benefits and problems for us. One, it is harder to export, but it also helps attract capital.

But when it comes to nation-building, when it comes to what is going to be a generational project in a place like Libya or a place like Syria or a place like Iraq, we can help, but we cannot do it for them.

And today, you know, I'd - I'd sense that at least outside of Russia, maybe some people are thinking what Putin did was not so smart.

Other geographics, other cultures, other patterns of thought all these must be respected. Indeed, all these contribute to a diversity in the world that we Americans believe should be cherished, not undermined. Yet we believe that certain fundamental elements of our experience are valid for the rest of the world the elements of democracy and economic freedom. Indeed, I believe that the world of the future can be just that a world of liberty, a world in which human rights are respected in the political and economic spheres alike. And I would submit that during these past 6 1/2 years of our administration, this world of the future has already begun to take shape. Economic growth along the Pacific rim has been little short of incredible. And more recently, a second victory for democracy in South Korea, where a free-market economy is already established and flourishing. In Latin America, nation after nation has turned to democracy, nine nations in all becoming democracies since 1979. Latin America's extraordinary effort to create a democratic order is the most stunning and moving political fact of recent years. Low-tax, high-growth policies have spread throughout the Third World, with countries from Botswana to Egypt to Thailand cutting their tax rates. Even China is experimenting with the granting of wider economic freedoms. Here in North America, recent developments hold particular hope for the future. This week the Institutional Revolutionary Party in Mexico chose Carlos Salinas, a forward-looking economist, as its next candidate for President. And the United States and Canada took the first important steps toward an historic free trade agreement, an agreement that could make our two nations the largest free trade area in the world as an example for all the globe. As I said, the global economy of increasing freedom and economic growth is already coming, it is already being built. The Communist nations know this as well as we do. They must either join the new world system or they will become obsolete. It is a decision they must make for themselves. For our part, we can only wait and hope. In the meantime, we can keep on building-building, here in the United States upon our historic, 59-month expansion; building, in each of your countries, upon much that you have already accomplished.

I appreciate the-Tonya Riggins, who is the Highland Park Head Start Center coordinator. I want to thank Lisa Dunmore and Alice Williams, the two fine teachers we had to meet. For the teachers who are here, thank you for doing what you are doing. You are a part of a noble profession, an incredibly important profession for the future of this country. You know what I know, that reading is the key to all learning. And the research-I see some of my friends from the National Research Council, National Institutions of Child Health who are here. He understands how the brain works, and he is spent a lot of time analyzing what works and what does not work. He caught my attention when I was the Governor of Texas. I would ask him a question, Are you sure we can teach kids, you know, the so-called impossible-to-teach? He said, Sure, I know it. And so he started doing research to convince the people about the real future. And he says that-he and his fellow researchers-that preschoolers can learn much more than we ever thought possible about words and sounds. In other words, society limited how much a certain-how much a preschooler could learn. It kind of felt like certain things were impossible to-certain knowledge was impossible to impart to our children, particularly the young. And so I want to thank Reid and the good folks who are focusing on science, who have opened up a tremendous realm of possibility now to achieve that which we want, a literate America. Even the youngest child can learn that we read words and letters from left to right or that letters are associated with sounds; even the youngest of toddlers can figure that out over time. In one exercise, children clapped for each syllable in a word. They can trace letters on the page to begin to understand the movements we use to write. They can play word games and learn rhymes and songs that help them to develop their own vocabulary. That sounds like a simple curriculum, but it is research-based, all aimed at laying the foundation for children to become good readers. These are what we call the building blocks, and these building blocks need to be a part of Head Start programs all across America.

Tomorrow I will be flying out to Illinois and Iowa to see the effects of the drought for myself. But when I heard that you were going to be here in Washington, I decided to take this day to meet with you, you who are in so many ways the leaders of American agriculture. First, let me say our administration is committed to taking whatever actions are necessary to protect America's farmers from excessive losses during this drought. Already we have taken a number of actions. We have formed an interagency drought policy committee to coordinate Federal action. The ENTITY Corps of Engineers is working hard to keep traffic moving on the Mississippi River and elsewhere in spite of some of the lowest water levels in history. And in order to help livestock owners, Secretary Lyng has permitted grazing on set-aside lands. And now is the time to start work on legislation to help the many crop farmers who will suffer substantial losses. At my direction, Secretary Lyng has been working closely with the leadership of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees in an effort to draft timely legislation. We have sought to make this a bipartisan effort, and so far I am pleased by the cooperation that we have received. Permit me to outline the five points we are seeking in this drought legislation. First, relief should go to those who need it most. Second, many of our farmers purchased Federal crop insurance, a sound business decision. They should not be penalized relative to farmers who-did not act with such prudence. Third, this legislation should not force farmers to do unreasonable things. No program should, for example, include any incentive for a farmer to plow under his crops. Fourth, drought relief spending has to be considered in the context of our efforts to reduce the Federal deficit; and according to the November 1987 bipartisan budget agreement that we reached with Congress, to put it very simply, we mustn't bust the budget. The automatic budget sequestration cuts that overspending triggers would take back from farmers with one hand what we are providing in drought relief with the other. And finally, this humanitarian assistance should not be used as a means to other ends. Extraneous matters, such as rewriting the existing farm bill, will only deter our efforts to provide this much-needed aid. Now permit me to tell you just where our efforts stand.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthestatepresidentstheamericanfarmbureaufederation", "title": "Remarks to the State Presidents of the American Farm Bureau Federation", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-state-presidents-the-american-farm-bureau-federation", "publication_date": "13-07-1988", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

If these threats can be controlled, and I believe they can, then we are prepared to limit our own strategic programs. But if an agreement cannot be reached, there should be no doubt that the United States can and will do what it must to protect our security and to ensure the adequacy of our strategic posture. Our new proposals go beyond those that have been made before. In many areas we are in fact addressing for the first time the tough, complex core of longstanding problems. We are trying for the first time to reach agreements that will not be overturned by the next technological breakthrough. We are trying, in a word, for genuine accommodation. But none of these proposals that I have outlined to you involves a sacrifice of security. All of them are meant to increase the security of both sides. Our view is that a SALT agreement which just reflects the lowest common denominator that can be agreed upon easily will only create an illusion of progress and, eventually, a backlash against the entire arms control process. Our view is that genuine progress in SALT will not merely stabilize competition in weapons but can also provide a basis for improvement in political relations as well. When I say that these efforts are intended to relax tensions, I am not speaking only of military security. I mean as well the concern among our own individual citizens, Soviet and American, that comes from the knowledge which all of you have that the leaders of our two countries have the capacity to destroy human society through misunderstandings or mistakes. If we can relax this tension by reducing the nuclear threat, not only will we make the world a safer place but we will also free ourselves to concentrate on constructive action to give the world a better life. We have made some progress toward our goals, but to be frank, we also hear some negative comments from the Soviet side about SALT and about our more general relations. If these comments are based on a misconception about our motives, then we will redouble our efforts to make our motives clear; but if the Soviets are merely making comments designed as propaganda to put pressure on us What matters ultimately is whether we can create a relationship of cooperation that will be rooted in the national interests of both sides. We shape our own policies to accommodate a constantly changing world, and we hope the Soviets will do the same.

And I want to tell you that I am proud to be a member of my party and proud to be an ardent supporter of the reelection of Senator Carol Moseley-Braun and the election of Glenn Poshard. There is I was told today when I came into Chicago that Congressman Poshard's opponent has an ad on attacking him for voting for our 1993 economic plan, claiming it was a big tax increase, neglecting to point out that income taxes were raised on about two-tenths of a percent of the American people, that 5 times as many people in Illinois got a tax cut as got a tax increase working families who need it the most and that that bill lowered the deficit 92 percent before the bipartisan balanced budget agreement passed and, therefore, was the single most important vote to the economic recovery America enjoys today.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksunity98dinnerchicagoillinois", "title": "Remarks at a Unity '98 Dinner in Chicago, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-unity-98-dinner-chicago-illinois", "publication_date": "10-08-1998", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Well, yes, I think there are more people who are opposing the regime right now in Nicaragua than actually fought in the revolution against Somoza.

You only have to look at the flood of refugees that are escaping from Nicaragua to realize that the people of that country are not happy with that totalitarian regime. Well, I know the Contadora is still trying to find an answer of that kind. The contras, themselves, have offered to lay down weapons and go into negotiations in an effort to have what they had fought the revolution for, and that is a democracy. And so, I think, as long as the people of Nicaragua are still striving for the goals of the revolution that they themselves fought, I think that we are obligated to try and lend them a hand. In this country, even though your popularity remains very high, on the issue of Nicaragua polls show that there are many Americans opposed to your policy there, and the Congress shows very little inclination to give you the $14 million you have asked.

And, of course, I do not think the people have heard the thing that we are tying to explain of what is going on. People go down, some people, to Nicaragua and claim they come back now with views that are favorable to that totalitarian government.

I believe that there are elements within the Pakistani Government that have supported those who engaged in violence in Kashmir. And what will you tell General Musharraf about that? Just exactly what I said to you. And I want to talk with him, as I did with Prime Minister Vajpayee, about the future. I think that in order to get out of a fix when you get into a fix like this and you feel paralyzed by your past practices, the only way to change it is to have a vision of the future which convinces you that if you want to achieve a certain goal, you have got to do it in a different way. And I will do my best to persuade him of that. I just do not think that this is the way to deal with Kashmir, and I do not think it is a good enough reason to drive, in effect, the whole existence, the whole policy of the Pakistani Government.

They have helped us even in my time, since the end of the cold war, to get terrorists, the terrorists involved one involved in the World Trade Center, one involved in the CIA killing. They have helped us in other contexts. I want to continue to be a good ally for them.

I do not think the United States can be involved in a three-way attempt to settle the Kashmir issue, unless and until they both want us. I think that that is the evidence you know, if you look at, we are in the Middle East because they both want us, not to say that either side agrees with everything I say and do, but we have a certain credibility there born of years and years and years of labor and a welcoming into the process.

The ideal was supposed to be that every nation would be there as an individual and seeking the same thing, the things that are called for in the charter of the U.N. And there has been evidence of the other, of kind of taking sides or bloc voting, and I was just trying to call their attention back to the original purpose. I will tell you, may I say something else about that, too? It is time that all of us recognize that maybe we are not as civilized as we were when I was a young man growing up. By that I mean that it was taken for granted for years and years, the days prior to World War II, that all the rules of warfare were aimed at limiting warfare to warriors and providing protection and neutrality for civilians.

Joe Biden's plan to abolish American energy is an economic death sentence for Pennsylvania. A vote for Biden is a vote to ban fracking and to send your state into a nightmare of poverty and depression, that is what is going to happen.

ENTITY, you have been urging the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to report out on the Sinai agreements by Friday. The problem there is that the two parties Israel and Egypt had agreed by, I think, early next week to sign the necessary documents and start the implementation of the withdrawal and the change of lines and so forth. Israel has said that it will not start the implementation until the Congress approves the utilization of up to 200 American technicians. So, we want it through by the time of the signing so that Israel and Egypt will both sign. Egypt has already signed, but Israel has this reservation. So, time is of the essence, so we can get both of those parties to move toward the actual implementation. You have said that you would like to see the orderly development of nuclear power, and this would certainly be a help in gaining our independence as far as energy is concerned. What do you see in the future for getting it straightened out so that we can look at it as a hopeful sign? We have had too many plant cancellations of nuclear power in the last 12 months very few if any for safety reasons, most of them for financing reasons. We expect there will be a resurgence of these projects in the months ahead. In the meantime, of course, we are spending vast amounts of money in the Federal Government to make even more certain the safety of nuclear powerplants. It is interesting to point out, however, of all of the nuclear powerplants in operation today in the United States, there has never been one fatality not one. But that does not mean we should not continue to find safer and better ways for the development of nuclear power. And I am optimistic as we try to make ourselves less vulnerable to foreign oil cartels, that nuclear powerplants will come on the line in greater numbers. But they are starting to question what the amount of uranium is at this point, while we are talking about millions and millions going into these plants, and then question the shortage already.

I am following around one of your newest-well, not your newest rivals but one of the newest candidates for President on the Republican side, Pete Wilson. So let me begin by asking you about your speech on Monday concerning the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. How do you plan to outline ways for the U.N. to reconstitute itself for the next 50 years? Well, I think we have to, first of all, recognize that-I think there are two fundamental realities we have to recognize. Number one is that the end of the cold war gives the U.N. the possibility of living up to the dreams of its founders in ways that were simply impossible when the world was divided into two large blocs. And so I think there should be a lot of hope about the U.N. The second thing I think we have to recognize is that in order for that hope to be realized, the U.N. has got to be properly run and, in particular, the peacekeeping operations have to be properly run. And the United States has spent a lot of time, because we pay a lot of the costs of the U.N., analyzing how the overall operations can be more efficient and cost-effective and inspire more confidence in the countries that are paying the bills and, in particular, looking at the peacekeeping operations and setting up systems to make sure that we use peacekeeping when it will work, that we restrain it when the situation is not right, and that the command-and-control operations are absolutely clear, that we do not have any kind of mixed signals and crossed lines that have sometimes happened in the past. And then when you look ahead into the future, I think it is clear that the new problems of the 21st century are likely to be rooted in ethnic, religious, and other internal problems within countries and across borders; dealing with or helping to avoid natural disasters that are brought on by a combination of population explosion and natural problems like the inability to produce food; and the rise of terrorism and the danger of proliferation of biological, chemical, and small-scale nuclear weapons.

He expressed his interest in so much that is going on in the world and some of the things that we are trying to do. But also we were so grateful for the opportunity to see him and have this meeting with him. They had arranged a little prayer service in his chapel, but not with him present. But we then went to his room, and he concluded the service before our visit with the final prayer. Senator D'Amato of New York and many others have been very forceful in their language calling for Mr. Watt to resign. What are your views about that? Well, first of all, I think Mr. Watt has done a very capable job as Secretary of Interior. I think we have to point out with all of this that it was an unfortunate remark. He has apologized not only to me, but he is apologized to the people on the Commission for that. But I think in all fairness we have to recognize that, yes, it was a very improper thing to say, but it certainly was not said in the sense of any bitterness or bigotry or prejudice. If I thought he was bigoted or prejudiced, he would not be a part of our administration. It was an attempt at lightness that, as we all have to admit, fell very fiat. So, I think that we have to recognize that, hope it will not be repeated. Do you think it'd be possible for him to continue in office? Do you think it would be possible for him to continue in office?

I have offered even more spending cuts than is in their bill. This is not about cutting spending, and they know it. I worked in good faith with the Republican majority in the Senate to shape a rescission bill that would be better for the American people and would still cut spending. For example, I worked with the Senate to add back some of the money in the LIHEAP program, which goes to States like New Hampshire to help older people with their utility bills, but we cut spending somewhere else. So we had an agreement that I would go along with this bill, and we worked in good faith. Then the Senate and the House Members went behind closed doors when nobody was looking and remember, this is not a partisan issue members of both parties put a lot of pork in the bill and took a billion and a half dollars in education funding out. And so let me just finish so all I told them was, I am all for it, cutting this much spending. Indeed, I think we should cut a little more spending. I offered another $100 million in spending cuts. But I do not believe if we are going to balance this budget and cut back on Government spending, then we need to be very careful about how we spend the money we do spend. We ought to target it to education. We ought to target it to things that will raise incomes and grow jobs in America and improve the security of the American people.

I will not demagogue or hide from it. I am here to speak about it directly and openly. I will not address every possible question or angle. Rather, I aim to start a constructive conversation about where we go from here in our divided country. Abortion is a deeply personal topic for both women and men. The issue should be addressed with sensitivity and respect, not judgment and hate. Most people have a story that has brought them to their views about abortion. It could be a trauma that a family member or friend endured. It could be our concerns for our daughters and their future. I am unapologetic and unhesitant about it. Not because the Republican Party tells me to be. My husband was adopted, and I am reminded of that blessing every day. Michael's birth parents lived in poverty. His father was an alcoholic and in and out of prison. His mother suffered a traumatic brain injury. When he was just a few years old, Michael and his siblings were taken from their home. Later, they were put in foster care. It was a rough experience for him. Thankfully, when he was four, a loving family adopted Michael and his younger sister. It changed their lives. Adoption literally saved them. Every day is a blessing because someone gave him life. Every day is a blessing because a family loved and raised him under difficult circumstances. The world is better because of Michael Haley. He is a combat veteran who served our country in war. He continues to help adoption and at-risk youth causes because he wants to help others who were born in his situation. I often think about what would have happened if Michael had not been so blessed if his biological mother had chosen a different path. My husband is reason number one that I stand for life. Every day I get to spend with the love of my life reminds me that I am blessed that someone saved his life. The second reason is that Michael and I struggled to have children of our own. I had many challenges as a teenager into my college years. I went through numerous surgeries. But what happened so easily for many of my friends was not my path. We went through countless sessions of fertility treatments.

I have got to get the Congress to see that we must help these people you are talking about. Another woman from Chicago who gave up a career for her children. She is a volunteer in the Chicago public schools for the last 10 years. She says, ENTITY, I am one of your Points of Light. I am wondering, though, how can we improve math and science in our schools when we do not even have the money in Chicago to buy toilet paper and soap for schools, for our children. Why do you feel money for our children is less important than bailing out the savings and loan industry? I do not think money for the children is less important. Federal spending for education is up. But I would remind her, tactfully because she does sound like she is an unselfish person who is out there trying to help as a volunteer and that is an enormous part of the success in education, I would remind her that the Federal Government spends 6 to 7 percent of the total money on education. Educational spending in the last 10 years is up from, oh, by a couple of hundred billion dollars from $115 billion, or something like this, to well over up around $300 billion. So, it is not always a function of money. Our America 2000 education program offers the best hope from the Federal level. It is not going to replace the State level or the level she is talking about, or what the communities can do for the toilet paper or for the classrooms, but it offers the best hope from the Federal level of getting our kids better educated. I am excited about it. I believe America 2000 can really fulfill the Federal Government's responsibility. We also have a woman, a mother, who raises her children in the housing projects of Chicago.

I think I shakes things up. We are doing incredibly on an economic basis. Financial stock market just hit another new high. We have had 84 since the election 84 new market highs. That in itself is a record. During the course of a little more than a year we have had think of it 84 stock market records. That is also a record, a world record for ENTITYs. But what happened is, we passed a tax bill not easy to get. Many people have tried to do it, they were not able to do it, and this is the biggest one we have ever passed, bigger than the Reagan bill. And it is had a bigger impact than anybody even thought. But I would also say that the tax cuts, added to the regulation cuts, is what made the difference. They are going to invest $350 billion, they are going to build plants all over the place, they are going to build a college, they are going to build this incredible campus. So it is a $350 billion investment, which I guess is probably the largest or certainly right up there largest ever made by a company.

And so the American people, as well, have begun to get kind of a different perspective on the great contributions that India can not only make to our own country but can make to the world. Our position on the United Nations Security Council has been very clear. First, we support a U.N. Security Council reform, but we think it ought to happen after other institutions within the United Nations become reformed. What I was always worried about is that we would focus on the U.N. Security Council and nothing else would happen. And so we have-we have said to all parties concerned-I fully understand the Indian position just like other nations- that we will take your case under consideration, but first things first. And a classic case of the reform I am talking about is the Human Rights Commission. And what I was, again, worried about is that we'd miss opportunity while focusing on the U.N. Security Council. ENTITY, when do you intend to take the U.S.-India nuclear deal before the Congress and before the Nuclear Supplies Group, which is part of the U.S. obligation? As we speak, Nick Burns of the State Department is discussing this vital issue with Indian counterparts. We are working through what has been-as I said in the speech, a difficult issue for the Indian Government as well for the American Government. To change the past, the ways of the past, can be difficult at times. I appreciate the Prime Minister's courage last July of laying out a way forward, which I support. And so first things first is to go to India and, hopefully, reach an agreement on separation and then bring that agreement back and start selling it to the Congress. It is -but we cannot bring anything back until we have agreed to the agreement.

Parents, of course, are the first line of defense against danger. To help our parents protect their children, the Department of Education has distributed a new guidebook providing practical steps that parents can take to make their children safer, practical steps that make it clear about how a parent needs to deal with their child about the dangers facing children. And this information, you will be pleased to hear, is written in ways so that the children can actually understand what is on the page. The book tells mothers and fathers how to rehearse with their children what to say or do if they ever feel threatened. It is a practical guide to explain to children how to deal with predators that are smooth and seductive, how to deal with somebody that is a stranger that sounds sweet-talking but may in their heart be dark and dangerous for our children. The book also lists web sites that provide information about protecting children. Parents need to pay as much attention to their children, by the way, when they are on the Internet as when they are on a playground. They have got to know what their children are doing on the Internet. They have got to know with whom they are conversing. We are passing it out to the Nation's schools, and the schools will then make it available to parents. And as well, parents can request a copy of the guidebook, a practical go-by as to how to train your children how to deal with potential danger. And you can find it on missingkids.com. If you are interested, if you want a practical go-by, call up missingkids.com on the Internet, and you will get some practical steps as to how to help your children avoid danger. Sometimes, in spite of a family's best effort, the unthinkable does happen, and that is really sad. It breaks my heart to know that that continues to happen in America. At that point, the parents need the sup-port-when their child is abducted, the parents need immediate support of their communities, quick action to find their children. Time is of the essence.

In your vision, can you foresee a day when there would be free travel of people across the borders without identity cards, just free movement of people in North America? That is probably down the road. But I am not imagining an important relationship, though, because we are really building on what our predecessors left behind, which is a trading arrangement that has substantially increased trade between the United States and Canada and Mexico. I am a believer that trade helps grow economies. I think free trade is an important part-and fair trade-something that Canadians want and something that Americans want is free and fair trade-benefits both of us. You know, we traded about nearly $500 billion, two-way trade, in 2005, which is very positive for both our economies. What I am concerned about is that protectionist tendency and isolationist tendency that could emerge in both our countries as well as in Mexico, which would make it harder for us to realize the benefits of collaboration together, make it harder for us to, kind of, grow together. And that would be not beneficial for the hemisphere, and frankly, it will make it a lot harder for future Americans and Canadians and Mexicans to compete with the Chinese, for example. And so there is a relationship which exists which needs to be protected and nurtured and streamlined and made more efficient, and that is really what the discussions will be in Cancun.

That kind of language we do have to shy away from. There are people, even some of your supporters, who feel that you have contributed to some of that incendiary language. Do you feel that?

What I said in my American University speech, and I continue to maintain, is a very logical argument, a dispassionate argument, which is, if, in fact, we reject this deal, then we have to , and if we all agree that Iran should not have a nuclear weapon , that is not in dispute , then what are the alternatives? The alternative that has been presented by some is, well, we should just maintain sanctions and keep squeezing Iran and eventually we will get a better deal. That better deal has typically been defined as Iran not just giving up a nuclear weapons program, but giving up any sort of nuclear program, peaceful or otherwise. And what I have said, which I think has been confirmed by every expert on Iran, but also the international community, is that Iran would never agree to what they would consider a complete capitulation. And we would not have the support of the international community in that position, which means that sanctions would unravel. And the critics have not responded very vigorously or effectively to that point. So if, in fact, that avenue is foreclosed, then what I have said is, is that by rejecting the deal, we leave ourselves with very few options. Iran potentially could continue what it was doing before we began these negotiations , shrink their breakout time to a matter of a few months or even a few weeks. We would not know what was taking place inside of Iran. And in that situation, then our most realistic option for preventing them from getting a nuclear weapon would be to take military strikes.

And I want to pursue that strategy. And I believe that all these discussions about, well, other strategies and should we do this, that, or the other thing do not help the ultimate success of the strategy we are pursuing. That is why I have used the words I have used; why I have said the words I have said. Now, on the merits of it, the thing that bothers me about introducing ground troops into a hostile situation-into Kosovo and into the Balkans-is the prospect of never being able to get them out. If you have a peace agreement, even if it is difficult and even if you have to stay a little longer than you thought you would, like in Bosnia, at least there is an exit strategy, and it is a manageable situation. If you go in in a hostile environment in which you do not believe in ethnic cleansing and you do not wish to see any innocent civilians killed, you could be put in a position of, for example, creating a Kosovar enclave that would keep you there forever. And I do not believe that is an appropriate thing to be discussing at this time. I do think we have got quite a good chance of succeeding with our strategy if we could keep everybody focused on it. And I simply think that it is wrong for us to be obsessing about other things and not working-people are frustrated because we live in an age where everybody wants things to operate like a 30-second ad. It is only been going on a few days, and it is been undermined to some extent by bad weather. But we are blessed with enormously skilled pilots, a good plan, good technology, and good resolve by our allies. And I'd like to see us keep working on this and not to have our attention diverted by other things.

This time, you, the private employers of America, will lead, not the Federal Government. The whole idea behind the job-training act is the spirit of new federalism. Private employers will work with Governors and locally elected officials to ensure a proper balance of activity within the States. With your leadership, the States can plan and carry out a training program that spends our resources the way they should be spent on training our people. Too often in the past, the bulk of funds set aside for Government job-training programs has been used to pay bureaucrats, not to help the needy. By embarking at least 70 cents of every program dollar for job training, we can eliminate the bureaucratic waste of the past. No one knows better than private employers the skills today's employees need or how to train them for the sunrise industries that will pioneer products and technologies for tomorrow. Never have we had a greater need for job training in America. Please do what you do best be leaders and help us make this program work. The Job Training Partnership Act provides you with the opportunity to work locally to explore targeted policies to reduce high youth unemployment. This can include working on ways to improve the transition from school to work, to help those who do not go on to college but who often lack the requisite skills to handle available jobs. Not only will this training help the individual, it can reduce the cost to employers of hiring young workers and the long-term unemployed. We must move forward together on other fronts. In September I signed the Export Trading Company Act, which I know the U.S. Chamber strongly supports. This legislation will increase exports and create trade-related jobs by encouraging formation of trading companies. The idea is already being used against us by our principal competitors. With your help, we will even up those odds. We will win back America's reputation as the great Yankee trader. Our administration will also push in the lame-duck session for passage of our enterprise zones initiative. This bill can revive the most impoverished areas of America, provide new incentives to develop business and create jobs. We must not slam shut the doors of opportunity on those who look to us for help. None of these actions would take us back to the inflationary, make-work programs of the past.

The law creating the Railroad Labor Board is inadequate. Contrary to popular impression, it has little or no power to enforce its decisions. It can impose no penalties on either party disregarding its decisions. It cannot halt a strike, and manifestly Congress deliberately omitted the enactment of compulsory arbitration. The decisions of the board must be made enforceable and effective against carriers and employees alike. But the law is new, and no perfection of it by Congress at this moment could be helpful in the present threatened paralysis of transportation. Happily it is always lawful and ofttimes possible to settle disputes outside of court, so, in a desire to serve public welfare, I ventured upon an attempt at mediation. Those who had preceded me in attempted settlements had made some progress. I submitted to the officials of the striking employees and the chairman of the Association of Railway Executives, in writing, on the same day, a tentative proposal for settlement. Knowing that some of the carriers had offended by ignoring the decisions of the board, and the employees had struck when they had a remedy without the strike, I felt it was best to start all over again, resume work, all to agree to abide faithfully by the board's decisions, make it a real tribunal of peace in transportation, and everybody serve the public. The barrier to be surmounted was the question of seniority. By the workmen these rights are held to be sacred, and unsurrendered by a strike. By the carriers the preservation of seniority is the weapon of discipline on the one hand and the reward of faithful employees on the other. In the tentative proposal which I sponsored it was provided that everybody should go to work, with seniority rights unimpaired, that there should be no discrimination by either workmen or carriers against workmen who did or did not strike. I realized that the proposal must carry a disappointment to employees who had inherited promotion by staying loyally on the job, and to such new men as had sought jobs looking to permanent employment, but I wanted the fresh start and maintained transportation service, and I appraised the disappointment of the few to be less important than the impending misfortune to the nation.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressrailroadandcoalstrikes", "title": "Address to Congress on Railroad and Coal Strikes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-railroad-and-coal-strikes", "publication_date": "18-08-1922", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Warren G.

Statutes which the Congress enacts are set aside or suspended for long periods of time, even in cases to which the Government is not a party. In the uncertain state of the law, it is not difficult for the ingenious to devise novel reasons for attacking the validity of new legislation or its application. While these questions are laboriously brought to issue and debated through a series of courts, the Government must stand aside. It matters not that the Congress has enacted the law, that the Executive has signed it and that the administrative machinery is waiting to function. Government by injunction lays a heavy hand upon normal processes; and no important statute can take effect against any individual or organization with the means to employ lawyers and engage in wide flung litigation until it has. Thus the judiciary, by postponing the effective date of Acts of the Congress, is assuming an additional function and is coming more and more to constitute a scattered, loosely organized and slowly operating third house of the National Legislature. This state of affairs has come upon the nation gradually over a period of decades. In my annual message to this Congress I expressed some views and some hopes. Now, as an immediate step, I recommend that the Congress provide that no decision, injunction, judgment or decree on any constitutional question be promulgated by any federal court without previous and ample notice to the Attorney General and an opportunity for the United States to present evidence and be heard. This is to prevent court action on the constitutionality of Acts of the Congress in suits between private individuals, where the Government is not a party to the suit, without giving opportunity to the Government of the United States to defend the law of the land. That sounds like common sense. I also earnestly recommend that in cases in which any court of first instance That is the District Court determines a question of constitutionality, the Congress provide that there shall be a direct and immediate appeal to the Supreme Court It does not take away any right of any lower court to pass on constitutionality, but it provides for an immediate appeal to the Supreme Court, and that such cases take precedence over all other matters pending in that court.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressconference22", "title": "Press Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-conference-22", "publication_date": "05-02-1937", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

It is good to see all of you here. This was a very important appointment to me. In one of my former lives I had the great joy and responsibility of teaching the United States Constitution and the decisions of the Supreme Court under it to aspiring but not always interested law students. We breathe life into the values we espouse through our law. It gives to every American, including the most illiterate among us, the most totally unaware of how the legal system works, a fair measure of our ideals and some reality that comes into life from the speeches given by the rest of us. This is a moment, this historic moment, therefore, that all Americans can celebrate. For no one knows better than she that it is the law that provides the rules that permit us to live together and that permit us to overcome the infirmities, the bigotry, the prejudice, the limitations of our past and our present. Her nearly unanimous confirmation by the United States Senate was the swiftest in nearly two decades. Much credit must go to her own brilliance and her thoughtful, balanced reasoning. But I thank Senators Moynihan and D'Amato for their sponsorship and assistance. I thank Chairman Biden and Senator Hatch for their contributions and all the other Senators, including those here present, who supported her. Ruth Bader Ginsburg does not need a seat on the Supreme Court to earn a place in our history books. She has already secured that. As a brilliant young law school graduate she became an early victim of gender discrimination when as a woman and mother she sought nothing more than that which every one of us wants, a chance to do her work. She met this challenge with character and determination. She took on the complex challenges of winning what seems now to be such a terribly simple principle, equal treatment for women and men before the law. Virtually every significant case brought before the Supreme Court in the decade of the seventies on behalf of women bore her mark.

So that is why we are doing it now. And you asked about other places. In the Rwanda case, let us remember what happened. In Rwanda, without many modern military weapons, somewhere between 500,000 and 800,000-we may never know-people were killed in the space of only 100 days. I think the rest of the world was caught flat-footed and did not have the mechanisms to deal with it. We did do some good and, I think, limited some killing there. But I wish we'd been able to do more there. And I would hope that that sort of thing will not ever happen again in Africa. And that is one of the reasons we worked hard to build up a cooperative relationship with African militaries through the Africa Crisis Response Initiative. So I believe there are lots of reasons. But if you look at Kosovo, we have a history there in Europe. We know what happens if you have ethnic slaughter there.

We had to be cautious on the early nights to try to at least protect our planes as much as we possibly can against the air defenses, which are quite good. So it takes a while to get up and going.

The big debates, the big changes that we had historically around everything from establishing public schools to the moon launch to Social Security, they were not subject to the filibuster.

{"id": 1687, "text": "As the country knows, we are in a great deal of turmoil. When you think about the names of Mike Brown, of Tamir Rice, of Eric Gardner, and even now of this young man in Phoenix, the country is concerned about can we trust police, are we safe with police. My first question for you is, in the midst of this and all that is going on you did not start this. This problem did not begin under your watch. But how much of it does your administration feel you are responsible for making an impact on? Well, I think an enormous amount. Not just because, as President, you are always responsible for what happens in this country and you have got to be part of the solution, not part of the problem, but because of my particular experiences that I bring to this office. I had a group of young people come before we met, a wider group of civil rights leaders and law enforcement. Most of them were somewhere between 18 and 25. A couple of them were from Ferguson. And when they described their own personal experiences of having been stopped for no reason, or having generated suspicion because they were in a community that supposedly they did not belong, my mind went back to what it was like for me when I was 17, 18, 20. And as I told them, not only do I hear the pain and frustration of being subjected to that kind of constant suspicion, but part of the reason I got into politics was to figure out how can I bridge some of those gaps and understanding so that the larger country understands this is not just a black problem or a brown problem, this is an American problem. So we take this very seriously. Eric Holder obviously takes it seriously. He is got a similar set of stories and experiences he can share. And in some ways, we have made progress over the last six years on a wide range of criminal justice issues, making sure that we looked at how are drug laws being enforced; making sure that we are shifting how at least federal prosecutors think about the charges they bring against low-level drug offenders. And we have had some success. I mean, that is part of the reason why we have seen, last year, for the first time in 40 years, the incarceration rate in federal prisons actually went down 10 percent at the same time that crime was still going down by 10 percent. And that showed we can have good policing and good law enforcement and be fair and be smart.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjeffjohnsonblackentertainmenttelevision", "title": "Interview with Jeff Johnson of Black Entertainment Television", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jeff-johnson-black-entertainment-television", "publication_date": "12-12-2014", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Well, I am not as pessimistic as that. I understand, of course, that it is not going to be easy. But I am going to make every effort to try and reduce the mistrust and suspicion that seems to exist between our-well, not only our two nations but sort of the East and the West.

Bilateral issues, a number of kind, that are between us probably would be the easiest thing that we will face in those meetings. And we will just carry on, see what we can do. ENTITY, I wonder, on arms control, are you going with a set negotiating position-some counterproposals to Mr. Gorbachev's proposals-and is your team of advisers finally united behind you? In our government here, I solicit and encourage varying opinions and ideas. I think it helps to make a decision when I hear all viewpoints. But I do not envision this meeting as being one where we will get down to specific numbers and so forth. We have a team of negotiators, each side, in Geneva that have been negotiating on the possibility of nuclear arms reductions for some time. We have had a proposal on the table in those talks for a considerable period of time, and finally, the Soviet Union came back with a counterproposal. And we have now offered a counter to that. We found encouragement in their counterproposal; there were numbers that we could agree with. And so, the proposal that we have made in response is one that kind of compromises between our original proposal and theirs, accepting some of their figures-in fact, some of the main figures on basic numbers and so forth-and then, our view on some of the complex issues about the mix of weapons and so forth.

We won credit card reform and financial reform and protections for consumers and folks who use payday lenders or send remittances home from being exploited and being ripped off. We worked to secure health care for 4 million children, including the children of legal immigrants. And we are implementing health reform for all who've been abused by insurance companies and all who fear about going broke if they get sick. And these were huge victories for the Latino community that suffers from lack of health insurance more than any other group. We are keeping our promise to give our young people every opportunity to succeed. NCLR has always organized its work around the principle that the single most important investment we can make is in our children's education and that if we let our Latino students fall behind, we will all fall behind. I believe that. So we have tied giving more money to reform. And we are working with States to improve teacher recruitment and retraining and retention. We are making sure English language learners are a priority for educators across the country. We are holding schools with high dropout rates accountable so they start delivering for our kids. We are emphasizing math and science and investing in community colleges so that all of our workers get the skills that today's companies want. And we have won new college grants for more than 100,000 Latino students. And as long as I am President, this country will always invest in its young people.

I am concerned about the Communist element and its influence in Portugal and, therefore, Portugal's relationship with NATO. This is a matter that I will certainly bring up when we meet in Brussels.

And after all, if we are spending a lot of taxpayers' money, which we are, it makes sense to determine whether or not these programs are, in fact, laying the foundation for reading. Now, I fully understand a 4-year-old child is not going to take a standardized test. That we would-we would be defeating the purpose of accountability before we even began if we said, Okay, we will give standardized tests to 4-year-olds. But we can have children assessed by asking simple questions. You know, words go left to right. Are you able to identify certain sounds? Are they developed by-developing the key skills necessary? And I think what needs to happen is- and I hope Congress agrees-that the simple evaluations at the beginning of the year and the end of the year will tell us whether or not progress is being made in developing a curriculum necessary to teach children how to read. And if they are, we ought to be praising the programs, and if they are not, something else ought to happen. We cannot miss the opportunity much longer in America. And so Boehner is here because his committee and the Congress is considering legislation that would put a new emphasis on language skills and literacy skills in Head Start programs. In other words, we are going to codify into law that which we have started through the teacher training program. The legislation will require Head Start providers to teach language, reading, and writing skills, as well as early math skills. In other words, it now becomes a part- when they pass the law that says the Head Start mission is further defined as an educational mission. And those programs that are used must be proven by scientific research. We are going to have high standards.

We need to be able to be a society that says, you get to earn more of that which you earn. As you might recall, we went through a pretty tough time in this country over the past 5 years. We had a recession, corporate scandals, a stock market correction, a attack on our country. We went to war to defend ourselves; we have had high energy prices; and we had natural disasters. And yet this economy of ours is strong. And I believe the reason why is, is because of the tax cuts we passed in Washington, DC. We believe that if you have more money in your pocket to save, spend, or invest, the economy grows. And so one way to make sure that we are the economic leader in the world is to make sure the tax cuts we passed are permanent. Now, people say, Well, if you make the tax cuts permanent, you cannot balance the budget. I have been there long enough to be able to give you an accurate report. Do not believe it when they say they are going to raise your taxes to balance the budget. They are going to raise your taxes and figure out new ways to spend the money. The best way to balance the budget is to keep progrowth economic policies in place. And, by the way, last year, because our economy was growing, we generated $100 billion more for the Treasury than we thought. And this year, because of the economy growing strong, we are generating better rates than we did last year. And so the best way to balance the budget is to keep growing the economy so we collect more tax revenues and be wise about spending your money. See, in Washington, everything sounds good there; every program sounds fantastic. But Government, in order to be wise about spending your money, has got to learn to set priorities.

So I need you to keep building a movement for change outside of Washington, one they cannot stop, one that is greater than this community. We need a movement that bridges party lines, that unites business and labor and faith communities and law enforcement communities and all who know that America cannot continue operating with a broken immigration system. And I will be there every step of the way. I will keep up this fight, because Washington is way behind where the rest of the country knows we need to go.

And I am assuming the temperatures were sort of like they have been the last couple days here in DC.

In other words, so when you talk about relations with an ENTITY, you have got to understand that there is a-at least I have, I know my predecessors have connections, close connections with people who have fond-either fond memories and/or great pride in their motherland.

Obviously, people are so different that you have just got to gauge your relationship to meet certain objectives. And our objective with our European friends is to have a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace and is in close concert with the United States. And so I think in this case, Prodi and Berlusconi share that objective, both share the same objective; same in Germany. And so I deal with them differently. They are just different types of people with different backgrounds. But I have known Romano Prodi, particularly since he was the head of the EU. I have worked with him quite a bit. Ask him about the time when I was riding my mountain bike on the beaches of Sea Island, Georgia. I made some kind of noise or something startled him out of his walking shoes, you know. He is a guy who I felt comfortable enough roaring by on a mountain bike, three Secret Service agents spewing up sand. I know him. I feel comfortable talking to him. I may-he may not agree with me.

Prove you are serious about reform, and we will show you the money. And because it is a competition for less than 1 percent of what our country spends on education each year, Race to the Top has led over 40 States to raise their standards for teaching, learning, and student achievement. And these standards were not developed in Washington, but they were developed by Republican and Democratic Governors all across this country. So we have made enormous progress. As Arne has said, this is probably the most significant education reform initiative that we have seen in a generation. But we need to make sure we are reaching every child in America, not just those in States or districts that take part in Race to the Top. And that is why not only do we need to continue this competition, we have got to open it up. And that is why we need to take the same bottom-up approach when it comes to reforming America's most important education law, otherwise known as No Child Left Behind. We have to reform No Child Left Behind. Now, over these last few weeks, during what we have called Education Month around the White House, I have been traveling across the country talking with folks about education. In fact, we have actually been doing that for the last couple of years. And what I have heard, what Arne's heard, what the rest of my team has heard loud and clear from teachers and students and parents and communities is that No Child Left Behind got some things right and got some things wrong. making a promise to educate every child with an excellent teacher. Shining a light on the achievement gap between students of different races and backgrounds and those with and without disabilities, that is the right thing to do. But what has not worked is denying teachers, schools, and States what they need to meet these goals. That is why we need to fix No Child Left Behind. We need to make sure we are graduating students who are ready for college and ready for careers. We need to put outstanding teachers in every classroom and give those teachers the pay and the support that they deserve. I got some applause for that one. We need to not only hold failing schools accountable, we need to help turn those schools around. In the 21st century, it is not enough to leave no child behind, we need to help every child get ahead.

Then, in an act and a statement, the likes of which I do not think I have ever heard, in Virginia, the governor a Democrat stated that he would allow babies to be born, to be born outside. He would wrap them. He would take care of them. And then he will talk to the mother and the father as to what to be done.

I know you are disappointed with the one-point loss, but you cannot be disappointed with the effort. I appreciate the fact that your class is the first in school history to win four straight Commander in Chief trophies, the first to go 8 and 0 against ENTITY and Air Force, and the first to play in four straight bowl games. That is a lot of firsts. Your class won 35 games in 4 years. The only Navy class to win more games graduated in 1909. I do not know whether William Howard Taft welcomed the team in 1909, but I can tell you, the 43rd President is proud to welcome such champions here to the Rose Garden. One of the reasons your team was so successful this year, of course, is because you had a captain from Texas. Five different Navy players rushed for more than 100 yards in a game this season. That is more than any other team in the Nation. I appreciate the fact that one of your quarterbacks stepped in for an injured starter and went on to score four touchdowns in a single game. I would like to say his name; I will probably bungle it. I will just say, the guy is from Hawaii. I appreciate the fact that Keenan Little became the first player in Navy history to score defensive touchdowns against Air Force and ENTITY in the same season. I am proud to be up here with a fellow Texan from Lewisville, Texas-the mascot of one of the high school teams in Lewisville, believe it or not, is the Fighting Farmers. He gained 134 yards against Air Force. When he was named MVP, he wisely-wisely-gave the credit to his offensive line. You know, it is interesting-how would you like to be the punter on the Navy team who went full-two full games without showing up on the field? Veteto-Greg is his first name-was, like, the punter on the team, and for two games in a row, he was never used. The team had a special leader in Eddie Martin. I do not know if the country knows this, but he was diagnosed with cancer last year. He did not play any games this year, but he always led the team out of the locker room for every home game.

{"id": 2959, "text": "For them to suggest now that this is some radical assault on the rich, I think, just makes no sense whatsoever. Here is what we do, though, we say that on health care, energy, and education, it is time for us to make investments that had been put off for decades and had made us less competitive. And every dime of increased spending that we include in those areas we offset either with additional revenues or with cuts, and we cut a lot of stuff. I mean, we are looking at billions of dollars of cuts out of Medicare's Advantage program, where we are subsidizing insurers but not making seniors any healthier. We are making significant cuts in procurement, $40 billion that we have identified by making sure that we are not engaging in the same no-bid contracting that has been such a problem. In fact, if you look at the trajectory of our nondefense discretionary spending, which is what usually people think about when they think about whether a budget is loaded up with a bunch of nonessential spending, following our budget, we would drive nondefense discretionary spending down to the lowest levels since they started keeping records back in '62, much lower as a percentage of GDP than it was under Reagan or under Bush. So really what the big arguments are going to be about are, number one, do you believe that now is the time for us to deal with health care in a serious way? And if you are serious about long-term fiscal responsibility and dealing with Medicare and Medicaid, then you cannot say we are not going to deal with health care now. If health care continues to go up at 6, 7, 8, 10 percent a year, then we cannot solve our budget deficits, and we cannot solve our national debt. So I am happy to have that argument with anybody. I also think that on the energy front, if we are not willing to start putting a price on carbons that are contributing to climate change but also encourage us to use fossil fuels that we end up importing from other countries, then we can talk all we want about energy independence; we are not going to get there. And on education, if we are pricing people out of the college market, if nobody wants to teach because teachers do not get paid much, if we are not investing in early childhood education, if we are not investing in science and technology, then we are going to fall behind.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithregionalreporters", "title": "Interview With Regional Reporters", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-regional-reporters", "publication_date": "11-03-2009", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

We can now set new State targets for gasoline consumption which will, within a year, reduce consumption by 400,000 barrels per day. This action also underscores a commitment to greater conservation that our friends abroad, both the producing countries and the consuming countries, can both join and support. Finally, the Secretary of Energy is pursuing an intensified national energy conservation plan. Our aim is to involve every level of government, business and labor-in fact, every single citizen in our country-in conserving American energy. Our fifth area of action involves longterm structural changes to encourage productivity, savings, and research and development. We must face the fact that over the last 10 years the pace of productivity growth in the United States has slowed sharply. This trend is an important longterm factor in inflation. I am asking my Presidential commission on an agenda for the 1980's as part of their work to develop specific recommendations for revitalizing our Nation's economy. Our priority now is to balance the budget, but once these spending limitations have actually been achieved, we can then provide tax relief to encourage investment. Through fiscal discipline today, we can free up resources tomorrow, through tax deductions, for the productivity increase which our Nation needs. This discipline which I have described to you will not be easy. But [he most important thing we cannot afford is the national delusion which we have been harboring about inflation. We cannot afford the fairy-tale that inflation can somehow be passed along to the next person or somehow be passed along to the next generation. The actions I have outlined involve costs. They involve pain. But the cost of acting is far less than the cost of not acting. The temporary pain of inconvenience and discipline is far less for all of us together than the still worst permanent pain of constantly rising inflation. For all of us, but especially for the most disadvantaged among us, inflation is indeed the most cruel tax of all. When we take these necessary steps against inflation, it will not result in a quick victory. Over the next several months inflation is likely to continue at a high level.

The other big news, of course, you heard at the top of the program, you saw the video today from a Trump rally. But of course, Donald Trump's campaign manager charged with simple battery for an altercation with a reporter recently. Moments ago, he just defended that campaign manager. He said, I know it would be easy for to discard people. I do not discard people. Should Trump fire Corey Lewandowski? Well, let us see what happens in the legal process. He is been charged, and we do not find people guilty until you go through a process. But my campaign manager does not assault female journalists, let me just say that. You know, John Kasich came out and said he would if this had happened to him. He would go ahead and fire his campaign manager. Well, let me just say this. Let me just say this.

But he was prepared - or at least indicated that he was prepared -- to pay the legal fees for somebody who quite openly sucker-punched somebody - right, knocked them down.

But ENTITY, to me, all of that stuff is interesting political stuff. But what we are trying to focus on in this campaign are the issues that impact the American people.

The notion that if I had taken a pinprick strike when the chemical-weapons issue came out, as opposed to negotiating and getting all those chemical weapons out-that that would have been decisive. But I do ask myself, Was there something that we had not thought of? Was there some move that is beyond what was being presented to me that maybe a Churchill could have seen, or an Eisenhower might have figured out? So that is the kind of thing that tends to occupy me when I have the time to think about it-mainly because I think that in this job one of the things you realize is there are problems that just end up being really hard and by definition the only problems that come to my desk are the ones that nobody else can solve. Usually, I am pretty good about sorting through the options and then making decisions that I am confident are the best decisions in that moment, given the information we have.

The night F.D.R. was first elected, he told his son James, All my life I have been afraid of only one thing-fire.... I am just afraid that I may not have the strength to do this job. He was a paralyzed man, so he never locked his door. Did you ever feel that? When confronting the explosion that you came into, with the recession and the difficulty we were facing? And that is the only time I think F.D.R. felt it, too. And then by the next day he was O.K.

{"id": 1461, "text": "It is now been nearly 5 years since an economic crisis and a punishing recession came together to cost far too many Americans their jobs and their homes and the sense of security that they had built up over time. And by the time I took office, my team and I were facing bubbles that had burst, markets that had cratered, bank after bank on the verge of collapse. And the heartbeat of American manufacturing, our auto industry, was flatlining. And all this meant that hundreds of thousands of Americans were losing their jobs each month. And nobody had any idea where the bottom would be. Four and a half years later, our businesses have created nearly 7 million new jobs over the past 36 months. We are producing more of our own energy; we are consuming less that we import from other countries. The cost of health care is slowing. The wealth that was lost from that recession has now been recovered. All of this progress is a testament to the grit and resolve of the American people, most of all. But it is also due in some measurable way to the incredible dedication of the men and women who helped to engineer America's response. Alan Krueger and Jason Furman. Today I can announce that Alan is heading back to teach his beloved students at Michelle's alma mater, Princeton University. When they get together, all they can talk about is Princeton, and they are all very proud, and those of us who did not go to Princeton have to put up with it. And I am proud to say that Jason Furman has agreed to replace Alan as the Chairman of my Council of Economic Advisers. Now, during the crisis, Alan stepped in initially to help engineer our response as Assistant Secretary and chief economist at the Treasury Department. He was so good that we then had to beg him to come back, extend his tour, to serve as the Chairman of my Council of Economic Advisers, where he is been the driving force behind actions that we have taken to help restart the flow of lending to small businesses and create new jobs and arm workers with the skills they need to fill them, to reduce income inequality, to rebuild our aging infrastructure, and to bring down our deficits in a responsible way. the idea that hard work should be rewarded.

We cannot expect young Americans to master the complexities of computers if they are high on drugs and alcohol. We must teach our sons and daughters a proper respect for academic standards, for codes of civilized behavior, and for knowledge itself. As the National Commission forcefully argued, we must also get our students back to the proper study of basic subjects. Today too many students are allowed to abandon vocational and college prep courses, so when they graduate, they are prepared for neither higher education, nor work, nor the training they may later need to keep up with technological advances. In 1980, 35 States required only 1 year of math for a high school diploma; 36 required only 1 year of science. We must insist that all our students master math, science, history, reading, and writing, the fundamentals of our civilization. Earlier this month, I signed into law the Education for Economic Security Act. It authorizes more scholarships for science and math teachers to help raise the level of instruction in those crucial basics. If we fail to instruct our children in justice, religion, and liberty, we will be condemning them to a world without virtue, a life in the twilight of a civilization where the great truths have been forgotten. In many schools, students are being taught the dangers of nuclear weapons and the burdens of national defense. Well, let us make certain they understand not only the price of defending America but the price of failing to. The students from St. George's University School of Medicine learned in Grenada that freedom is worth sticking up for. And while it makes sense that our children learn of our nation's problems, I hope they are also learning that Americans are good and decent people who face up to those problems with courage and conviction. Yes, we are human, we have our faults. But by any objective measure, we live in the freest, most prosperous nation in the history of the world, and our children need to know that.

It is when our son or daughter calls from college to talk about which job offer they should take.and you try not to choke up when you hear that the one they like is not far from home. It is that good feeling when you have more time to volunteer to coach your kid's soccer team, or help out on school trips. But for too many Americans, these good days are harder to come by. How many days have you woken up feeling that something really special was happening in America? Many of you felt that way on Election Day four years ago. Hope and Change had a powerful appeal. If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, should not you feel that way now that he is President Obama? You know there is something wrong with the kind of job he is done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him. The President has not disappointed you because he wanted to. The President has disappointed America because he has not led America in the right direction. He took office without the basic qualification that most Americans have and one that was essential to his task. He had almost no experience working in a business. Jobs to him are about government. I learned the real lessons about how America works from experience. When I was 37, I helped start a small company. My partners and I had been working for a company that was in the business of helping other businesses. So some of us had this idea that if we really believed our advice was helping companies, we should invest in companies. We should bet on ourselves and on our advice. So we started a new business called Bain Capital. The only problem was, while WE believed in ourselves, nobody else did. We were young and had never done this before and we almost did not get off the ground. In those days, sometimes I wondered if I had made a really big mistake.

Do you think you will get credit for your Presidency, at this point? I do not worry about it as much anymore. The only reason I worried about it in those years was that I felt that Congress. those people reported back you were feeling really angry about this. Well, you know, I do not think it is possible for me to convey how terrible I felt for other people that we lost the Congress in the '94 election. And all those people that put their necks on the line and were defeated, primarily because they voted for the economic plan and the voters had not felt the positive impact of it yet and they voted for the crime bill. And they had all these fear arguments out there on what we did on assault weapons and the Brady bill and that was really in the election cycle, and that passed and there was no attempt to see that the 100,000 police and the gun safety measures would work. But the fear was out there and then, of course, when we were unsuccessful in getting even a compromise initiative on health care that deflated our side's vote a little bit. And those three things together caused a lot of very good people to lose their seats, and I felt badly about that. I never felt that as so many people did at the time that it meant that the administration could not get reelected, because I always believed that the country had serious problems, and we had to tackle them early and brave the controversy early and that if I turned out to be right about our economic strategy and we continue to make progress and we passed our education program, the beginning of it, in '93 and '94, that it would work out fine.

Countering Syria's use of chemical weapons shows that the United States will act to prevent some of the worst weapons in human history from becoming the new norm.

With allies and partners, we continue to pursue a comprehensive strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, including diplomacy, pressure, and increasing sanctions. And, as the President has said, all options remain on the table. For our efforts to succeed, however, the leaders in Tehran must know that the United States means what we say. If we do not respond when Iran's close ally, Syria, uses weapons of mass destruction, what message does that send to Iran? It risks suggesting that the international community cannot muster the will to act when necessary. It risks suggesting that serious threats to regional and global stability will be left to fester. It risks suggesting that egregious violations of international norms do not have consequences. Make no mistake, the decision our nation makes in the coming days is being watched in capitals around the world, especially in Tehran and Pyongyang. They are watching to see whether the United States will stand up for the world we are trying to build for our children and future generations.

We have seen Fannie Mae refinance $77 billion of mortgages in March, which is their highest volume in one month since 2003. And rates on 30-year mortgages have dropped to an alltime low of 4.78 percent. So we are at a time where people can really take advantage of this. And what we want to do is to send a message that if you are having problems with your mortgage, and even if you are not and you just want to save some money, you can go to makinghomeaffordable.gov--. And the way the web site is designed, you can plug in your information and immediately find out whether or not you are potentially eligible for one of these mortgage refinancings. Now, we are in the process of rolling out some additional phases to the program. Everybody here represent responsible homeowners who made their payments, who have jobs and income that support their mortgages. In some cases, people may have had difficulties because they lost a job, somebody in their family got sick, they may have missed some payments. And in those cases we also want to be helpful, and we are putting in place a loan modification program, working with banks, working with services, that will allow other folks who are closer to losing their home in a stronger position in the future. So there are a range of different programs that are available for a range of different types of borrowers.

And then, as you know, I have been rolling out a lot of these new proposals. And actually, there will be a couple of things that will be quite new that I am not prepared to release yet. But I will have a couple of new proposals. But I think that the most important thing to me is to keep the country moving in this direction and aggressively embracing change, the right kind of change. That, I think, is critical to keep the recovery going, to keep bringing more people into the process of prosperity, and to keep bringing the country together. So a lot of what I will recommend that is new is certainly consistent with what I have been doing for 7 years. I came to office with a very clear idea of where I thought America was off base, what I thought we ought to do, what kind of governing strategy I would have. And I think people- some people will say, Well, he does things in increments. But if you walk down the road 7 years and you look back-I mean, if I told you 7 years ago, after 12 years of quadrupling the national debt, I will give you in year 6 and 7 the first back-to-back balanced budget surpluses in 42 years, from a $300 billion debt, you'd say that is not an incremental change; that is a big change. But you do those things in small steps. If you look at the millions of people-we have cut the welfare rolls about in half-it happened in incremental steps. But it is a huge thing in the aggregate. And all the economic changes- we have got the lowest African-American, Hispanic unemployment rate ever recorded, the lowest female unemployment rate in 40 years, lowest poverty rate in 20 years, lowest single parent household poverty rate in 46 years. So you take it in steps, but if you keep walking in the same direction, all of a sudden your steps constitute a giant leap forward. In that larger mosaic, how do you-of your record and your legacy in what you have done incrementally-down the road, how important will it be if, 15 years from now, we have not made significant advances on the debt?

No, I think with regard to the veterans, we were talking about medical benefits for the veterans and so forth. And I do believe that this is a contract that you have to take care of those who have served their country. Social security-what I said to them was-and this was the basis of the plan that we submitted, but which was widely distorted in the debate that followed and I think for pure political demagoguery-that all the way through the campaign I cited the immediate problem of social security, of its running out of funds, and the long-range actuarial imbalance which is in the trillions of dollars, if you look on down the road, for those people who are just beginning their working years. What I pledged to do was to have a social security-to put it on a sound fiscal basis, and yet not at the expense of those people who are presently retired; that you pull the rug out From under them and reduce their benefits. The only thing that could be called a reduction in any way in the proposal we made, of those existing benefits, was we were going to try and get social security onto the fiscal year basis with regard to the cost-of-living adjustment. That would mean that for 1 year alone, they would go 15 months instead of 12 before their cost-of-living adjustment was computed. And that would, as we figured it out, average probably a $90 reduction of increase, not a reduction of existing benefits, reduction of their increase over their lifetime. The other things that we had suggested in that program were not aimed at deserving and eligible recipients. They were aimed at the abuses in the program, people that are collecting disability benefits and are not disabled.

I think the important thing is, when they go there, I hope that they will reaffirm their support for democracy and for human rights and for a transition to democracy and to an open economy in Cuba. As you know, most countries do not agree with our policy on Cuba.

You cannot lead people unless you are optimistic about what you are doing. You have got to believe it in your very soul.

If I made an error in those, even though they always received very high public approval ratings, they said it always took me so much time to explain my specific ideas in education or whatever, I am not sure I ever took full advantage of the opportunity to lay the coherent philosophy out because I do think at those points, that people got it. But what I was going to tell you, if I could go back I think we had the transformation from the industrial economy to the information economy, from the idea of a national society to an idea of a more global society in which nation-states matter. I think the nation-state will matter more in some ways in the 21st century. We can talk about that some. And thirdly, the whole idea of defining America where our diversity was something to be cherished and celebrated because because our common humanity and common values were more important.

And I think that is often that has not often been the business of the Government. But if you go back to Roosevelt's focus on conservation or Wilson's struggle of failed attempt at the League of Nations, I think what made them both great Presidents for the transformational period America was in is that they were not only successful in the moment, by and large, but they had this focus on the future; they kept trying to spark the public imagination with the future. And that is I hope very much that the announcement of this genome project, although I think it fills people with foreboding as well as hope, will tend to spark future orientation on the part of the voters, so the issues that are plainly before us, but will not be felt for a few years will have more effect on the debate and also on people's voting rights.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjoekleinthenewyorkernewyorkcity", "title": "Interview With Joe Klein of the New Yorker in New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-joe-klein-the-new-yorker-new-york-city", "publication_date": "05-07-2000", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Bill Clinton"], "gender": ["M"]}}

One thing about Governor Stevenson that I want to stress to you he really understands and really believes in the basic principles of equality that make our country great. He believes in equal treatment for everybody, no matter who they are or where they come from. Now, that kind of understanding, my friends, is important for a lot of reasons. There is one in particular that I want to stress here this morning. I want to talk to you about the sad fact that the immigration laws of our country do not recognize these basic principles of equality and fair play. These laws, passed by a Republican Congress and a Republican President in the 1920's, say that the Polish, Ukrainian, and Italian people who want to move to this country are less desirable than the people from northern Europe. So each year our doors are closed to all but a few people from southern and eastern Europe. This year we tried to get rid of this unfair law, but the Republicans in Congress with the help of some Democrats passed over my veto that awful McCarran Act. This new act makes our immigration laws even more unfair than ever to the Poles and the Italians and the people of Slavic countries. Men like your own Bill Benton fought hard against this unfair law. I am glad to say he was supported by our vice-presidential candidate. But the Republican candidate for Vice President voted wrong, just as you would expect-and he has voted wrong every time he has had a chance to vote in the Senate, when the affairs of the people were at stake. Now it is true that this new bill bears the name of a Democrat. But he is not my kind of a Democrat at all. I like a Democrat who votes with the interests of the people. The Democrat for whom this bill is named cannot speak for the party. I speak for the party, and he I say is not my kind of a Democrat.

Do you feel that there is a little imbalance in the transatlantic relationship? First of all-let us deal with the two things separately. I do not think that is a fair characterization of what happened when we had the Summit of the Eight in Denver. Before the other leaders arrived, I gave one speech in Colorado in which I said, 7 years ago when the other countries met in the United States, Europe criticized America, 7 years ago, for dragging down economic growth in the world because our budget deficit was so high, for taking money away from worthy investments in Europe and in other places in the world by having high interest rates in America to finance our deficit. And we have changed that. So now we cannot be criticized by our friends in the Summit of the Eight, because we have changed that and we are better off than we were then.

When I met with the other leaders, I said clearly we have been fortunate; we have created a lot of new jobs. The British also have now created a lot of new jobs. But what happens in this global economy is, as you create more new jobs, the more open the economies are, you have more difficulty in avoiding greater inequality among your people. So the trick is how to preserve the social compact and create jobs. This is a problem we share together; that is what I said. And anybody who was there in those private meetings will say that.

While it is true that the region has changed dramatically over the last two decades, it has done so in a way that largely aligns with our values and advances our national interests. We can take pride in the fact that the inter-American community today is a region free of inter-state conflicts and broadly dedicated to democratic principles, social progress, and sustainable growth. We very much want countries in the Americas reaching out and cementing commercial relationships with Europe, Africa, India, and Asia-it can mean more prosperity and opportunity for us all.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithefenewswire", "title": "Interview with EFE Newswire", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-efe-newswire", "publication_date": "09-04-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Well, Hillary and I both spent a lot of time on this, and it is important for two reasons. One is, I was in music when I was the age of these children, and I know what it can do. And secondly, I have been very disturbed over the years over the last 20 years, more and more, as schools have come under financial pressure, they have tended to drop their music programs. You know, the principals have a lot of problems. They have a lot of challenges they have to meet, and many times the money is not there. And the school districts have cut a lot of these music programs out all over the country. And when I heard what VH1 was doing, I did kind of volunteer to get involved. I wrote John Sykes a letter and said, Look, I am for this, and I think we have got to get music back into these schools. A lot of young children we know that a lot of our young children learn better if they have access to music education. Not everyone learns in the same way. Not everyone's brain is stimulated in the same way. And the schools that have vigorous music programs tend to have higher academic performance.

And I say, I have got choices. I have to make cuts. I have got school lunches over here. I have books for the library here. I have music education over here. How do you stop me from cutting music education? And that is what that wonderful movie about music education here in New York City, Music of the Heart, was about.

I am looking forward to the seaside resort. Of course, I am anxious to see the Chancellor. She and I have got a very strong relationship. I do not know if you know this or not, but we do visit via secure video on a fairly regular basis. I have had some-you know, a lot of meaningful conversations with her, other than by phone. And this year I will be talking about the need for all of us to work together to deal with ENTITY/ENTITY and malaria and education. And, of course, global climate change will be an issue as well. And then we will go on to Poland. I am looking forward to going back-for my third time; twice in Czech Republic, third time in Poland. Of course, part of the discussions with both countries will be on missile defense. I will be glad to answer any questions you have on that.

Only thus, these zealots would have us believe, can we poor citizens be protected against exploitation against what they call the predatory exponents of capitalism--that is, free enterprise. Now, let us have a quick look at this matter. In the first place it is, of course, not difficult to be generous with someone else's money. So the individual who wants to build power dams only with Federal money is not directly or particularly concerned with the economic necessity of the project or with the suitability of its location. Secondly, these advocates of centralized government shut their eyes to the remarkable development of this Nation during past decades. They must wonder how such prosperity came about when communities and citizens were free to look after themselves--including their own protection against the so-called local interests. These believers in centralization fail to warn us that monopoly is always potentially dangerous to freedom--even when monopoly is exercised by the Government. Curiously enough, they proclaim their fear of a private power monopoly in a county, city or State, but they urge upon us all a gigantic, overwhelming, nationwide power monopoly. But, of course, they also see themselves as the all-wise directors of that monopoly-so all would be well. monopoly, nor do they want a system leading toward it.

In each instance the people directly concerned by such operations have themselves decided whether they are best served by public or by private agencies.

And finally, I am have expressed and will continue to dialog with the President about my deep concern about Iran. Iran we believe Iran had a secret military weapons program. And Iran must explain to the world why they had a program. Iran has an obligation to explain to the IAEA why they hid this program from them. Iran is dangerous, and they will be even more dangerous if they learn how to enrich uranium. And so I look forward to working with the President to explain our strategy and figure out ways we can work together to prevent this from happening for the sake of world peace. So I am sure proud to have you here, Mr. President, and welcome. It has been a great pleasure for me to accept your invitation.

Who benefits from it? And how should it be handled to guarantee that we are going to take care of first things first strengthen Social Security and Medicare, paying down the debt, continuing to secure the health of the American economy? Keep in mind, what produced the surplus was the strength of the American economy, the fact that we had the will to do the very tough things in 1993 and that we followed it up with a Balanced Budget Act in 1997. So my plan has tax cuts. The USA accounts are worth literally hundreds and hundreds of dollars to most families every year. They could be worth a quarter of a million dollars to a family over their lifetime. It is most progressive inducement to save in the history of the country. We have tax cuts fully paid for already, for long-term care, for child care, for school construction, for investing in the inner city. So I am not against tax cuts.

It is engaged in development of missile technology that is in contradiction to its commitments. And that is why you see the international response that you have seen. And we will continue to work with our allies in Seoul and Tokyo, as well as with partners in the region and around the world, to attempt to prevail upon North Korea to choose a different path. That path, by the way, is open to North Korea. There is an opportunity for North Korea to give up a path that has resulted in isolation and impoverishment for North Korea, and rather to abide by its obligations and therefore enter the international community or rejoin it, and improve the lot of its people. And we hope that North Korea takes that path. Going back to the budget -- if the budget is a first offer of sorts and the President has already put chained CPI on the table, where does he go in negotiations? Is he willing to offer anything more when it comes to entitlements? It has been asked in the past whether this is a starting point. The President's budget represents a fair-minded, serious offer at trying to find common ground with Republicans. The American people expect and support a balanced approach to deficit reduction. The American people expect their leaders in Washington to protect senior citizens, to protect the middle class. They certainly do not expect or support an approach that would put the burden of deficit reduction on seniors and the middle class. They support investments in education and innovation, in infrastructure that the President has within his budget. They support universal access to pre-K for America's children, because that is good for the children now and it is good for the development of our economy in the future. The President's budget is a common-sense document that represents a sincere attempt to compromise with Republicans on behalf of the whole country. The fact is it is not an la carte menu, as I think Gene Sperling said yesterday in our briefing.

First of all the warmth of the reception from all your people, and I mean not just the people of diplomacy and government that I had dealings with, but your people there on the streets and their showing of hospitality and friendship has been very heartwarming. But I have always believed that we only get in trouble when we are talking about each other instead of to each other. And since we have had an opportunity here to not only speak with your Diet but then to meet with your Prime Minister and others-and, of course, I have been greatly honored to have been received by His Imperial Majesty, your Emperor-I think that we have established a human kind of bond, not just one that is framed in diplomacy, but an understanding of each other as people. And I think that the world needs more of this. ENTITY, I would like you to know, in the first place, that many of my compatriots will be surprised and very happily so at the inclusion of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the list of the places that you'd like to visit or you wish you could visit. And to this end, of course, you will have to be a young sagacious man so that you will be able to fulfill your and our common desire in this regard. This is too dangerous a world to just be careless with words or deeds. And if ever there was a need for the world to work toward peace and to work out of the dangerous situation that we are in, that time is now. On a more, a little more serious note, Mr. ENTITY, my question is exactly related to this point. And that is, because of the experience that we in Japan went through, we are very genuine in hoping even for a very minimum, limited progress in the arms control talks which are currently underway. And just as it took another Republican ENTITY with very conservative credentials to effect a rapprochement very successfully with China, there are Japanese who hope that, perhaps, your hard-line policy may lead to the relaxation of East-West tensions. And in light of these hopes and expectations, Mr. ENTITY, could you comment on these talks? And, also, I would appreciate it a great deal if you would give us your assessment of the current state of and, perhaps, future prospects for U.S.-Soviet relations, particularly in the arms control area.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithrepresentativesnhktelevisiontokyojapan", "title": "Interview With Representatives of NHK Television in Tokyo, Japan", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-representatives-nhk-television-tokyo-japan", "publication_date": "11-11-1983", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I think the winner of West Virginia-Duke will end up winning the championship. I do not . And at that time, we were talking about hope and change. And you were going to change the dialogue and the tone in this country. And you said, Matt, it takes time. We have to build trust with the Republicans before the tone can change. If you look at historically what happens is that a party that is out of power, oftentimes in those first few years out of power end up reacting very negatively. And it may take the next election or the next presidential election before things settle down. I think what is important is that we recognize, A, we can disagree without being disagreeable; B, that all of us, Republicans and Democrats, have a responsibility as leaders to set the tone -- to not exaggerate what the other side is trying to do, to not suggest that they are bad people, to assume that they want what is best for America, even if we disagree on the particular approach. And so my hope is that the Republican leadership will take that tone. Certainly that is the tone that I want to take. And I think that when you look at the issues that are still out there -- we still have to have an energy policy in this country that reduces our dependence on foreign oil; we have still got a broken immigration system; we still have financial regulatory reform, a major issue that I have been talking about now for several years, where we have got to figure out how to prevent the same kind of situation where a few reckless banks can bring down an entire economy. And on each of these issues, I am going to actively seek Republican support. But there are going to be areas where we disagree, and I will continue to maintain a tone where, if they have got good ideas, I am going to take them.

We did not always agree, but I can understand people not agreeing with some of the decisions I made. But that does not necessarily mean there is any problems with the relationship. I guess much has been made about some of the name-calling that went on. That is just part of politics, and it does not bother me in the least. If I was bothered about name-calling from Canada, I'd certainly be bothered about name-calling from the United States as well. The relationship between Canada and the United States is really a relationship not necessarily by government only but by the peoples, by the interchange, by the exchanges we have, by the relatives on both sides of the border. In that regard, Prime Minister Harper, the new-I think this is now the third Prime Minister you have gone through-- He said that of the top priorities that he is got, softwood lumber has to be number one; says it is , in his words, putting a very serious strain on the relationship between the two countries.

I thought we were pretty close to a deal a couple of years ago-I cannot remember the exact timing of it, but I know we have been working on softwood lumber for quite a while. I fully understand how difficult an issue this is, particularly from Canada's perspective, since there is been some rulings. I told that to Stephen Harper, that I understand its importance. I understand its priority. And I'd like to get the issue resolved once and for all myself. The best thing I can do is tell our negotiators that-see if you can find common ground.

People are tired of this man. They are tired of seeing food and medicines go in only to have them ripped off and be sent to the Republican Guard or to the people in Tikrit. And so I think we are watching a situation with growing dissent, growing discouragement about this brutal dictator, regret at being isolated by the world community. And who knows what the dynamics inside Iraq will eventually be when that move that I mentioned now just becomes paramount, when everybody feels that way? Is it difficult having been such a hero of the Gulf war and to see the popularity polls reflecting that and then to see the popularity rating come down with the economy?

No, I think ENTITY has to -- I think people, when they are frustrated on an economic sense, they will blame Congress, they will blame ENTITY, they will blame the Governor. They will blame anybody.

So, it is true that when it comes to ISIL, us devoting another trillion dollars after having been involved in big occupations of countries that did not turn out all that well - I am very hesitant to do that because we need to spend a trillion dollars rebuilding our schools, our roads, our basic science and research here in the United States; that is going to be a recipe for our long-term security and success. And what we have also learned is that if we do for others what they need to do for themselves - if we come in and send the Marines in to fight ISIL and the Iraqis have no skin in the game, then it is not going to last.

You go to your community centers, your houses of worship, your wherever you go to hang out your coffee shops, and you tell your neighbors about their responsibility.

When you are out rounding up the vote, make sure you round up the vote for Mike Fisher and Jane Earll. I know something about his track record in getting votes. In the year 2000, I was a pretty heavy lift for the ticket, I must confess, here in Pennsylvania.

And that is why I have appointed this bipartisan fiscal commission to give me recommendations in terms of, how do we deal with this in a serious way moving forward. So in effect, that changes the terms of your promise in the campaign, because of that worsening deficit situation? I believe that we should be able to solve this problem without putting a burden on middle-class families. I believe that we should be able to make sure that we do not burden middle-class families further. Having said that, I am also going to wait for the fiscal commission to provide me what their best recommendations are. Because the one thing that I think all of us agree on is that we are currently on an unsustainable path, and that means that we are going to have to have a tax system that works better for everybody and is simplified. That means that we have got to get control of entitlement reform. And by the way, health-care reform went a long way towards doing that. But we are also going to have to look at Social Security and the other aspects of entitlements. It means that we are going to have to cut out waste in the system. But at a certain point, what we have got to do is match up money going out and money coming in. And right now, we have got a huge structural debt that I inherited and that the recession made worse.

Now, I know that you have already heard from the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce and a number of others, so I will try to keep my own remarks brief. Given the subject, I would not want anyone to mistake me for a lawyer. But looking out, I can see what a diverse group we make up from Boy Scouts to businessmen, from campers to child-care workers. This is an all-American event, because this problem affects all of America-every man, woman, and child. Originally, of course, tort law protected innocent people against wrongful damage or injury. Rooted in the Middle Ages, tort law became especially important at the onset of the Industrial Revolution, when ordinary men and women began to find themselves presented with services and products they'd never before encountered. By providing consumers with a measure of protection, tort law enabled them to enter this new marketplace with a certain confidence and ease. Back in the days when toothpaste was a newfangled invention, for example, consumers could purchase it with a much greater sense of assurance when they knew that, because of tort law, the manufacturers had to take all reasonable steps to make certain that the product was both effective and safe. Maybe some of you will remember a passage in Huckleberry Finn that deals with this very subject. I'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth, and it does take it off, too, and generally the enamel along with it. [ Twain never mentions tort law, but it is there in the background, the force that kept this character in the book constantly on the run up and down the Mississippi. And in the real world it was, in large part, tort law that reduced such swindlers from an actual presence in our economic life to figures that we remember with laughter. So, over the years, tort law has helped us drive the malevolent and the negligent out of the marketplace. This, in turn, has permitted legitimate economic innovation to take its course and raise living standards throughout the Nation.

I will not sign a bill that I think makes a false promise to the people of the United States. We have got to sign a bill that achieves full coverage for the American people. If you do not do it, you cannot contain costs, you cannot give the breaks that small business needs over the long run. You cannot achieve these things. So, yes, if Congress passes a bill that is different from the one I originally proposed, would I veto it? It depends on whether it achieves full coverage. If it is a credible attempt to do that, then I am open to it. But it must be a credible, credible bill to do that. And that is the only thing I ask all of you to focus on now.

The other day let me just give you this in closing because this is very important, and if I do not achieve anything else today in this conversation that I have had with you, which I have enjoyed immensely, if I can achieve agreement with you on this, it would be something profound to me. I have studied it for years and years. But the more complex it gets, the more you understand that in the end it comes down to some simple choices. In every nation that has covered everybody, quality health care can be provided at lower costs than in the United States, the only nation that does not cover everybody. Will it work? We are going in the wrong direction. We are losing coverage and exploding cost. I am not going to sign a bill that I think perpetrates these problems on the American people. If someone else can figure out how to get universal coverage in a different way than I have achieved it, I would be open to that. I have not seen it yet.

This kind of growth is doubly important to try to reduce trade barriers and to promote both bilateral trade and mutual responsibility for the whole world's trading system. But most important are the advances in human welfare that have touched the lives of ordinary Indians. Life expectancy has increased by 20 years since your independence. The threat of major epidemics has receded. The literacy rate in your country has doubled. While only a third of Indian children went to school in the years just after independence,. nearly 90 percent of primary-age Indian children now receive schooling. Nine times as many students go to universities as they did before. I mention these gains that we tend to overlook in our preoccupation with the problems that quite properly face and engage our attention. India's difficulties, which we often experience ourselves and which are typical of the problems faced in the developing world, remind us of the task which lie ahead. But India's successes are just as important, because they decisively refute the theory that in order to achieve economic and social progress, a developing country must accept an authoritarian or a totalitarian government, with all the damage to the health of the human spirit which comes with it. We are eager to join with you in maintaining and improving our valuable and mature partnership of political and economic cooperation.

And whenever a criminal act like that is state-sponsored, it is a problem. I just had a terrific roundtable with CEOs and chief information officers from a whole bunch of different sectors of the economy. And one of the uniform things they said was state actors are in a different category because of the sophistication and the resources and the patience that they have. That is an area where private sector's going to have to get help immediately from the government in a much more aggressive way, and a lot of what we are doing in terms of information sharing, gathering data, getting it out, disseminating it all throughout the economy much quicker we have gotten better at that. Then what you have is a bunch of non-state actors, hackers, criminals, etc., that are just flooding the system, constantly probing for weaknesses. And part of what this summit is about is both making sure that we have mechanisms for government/private sector cooperation, increased consumer awareness of how they can reduce their vulnerabilities, how we can build better defenses, how we can respond better and more resiliently. And one of the big conclusions is this is moving so fast that we have got to have a more nimble system.  I get that. We have started with critical infrastructure. That is an area where heavy involvement with those industries whether it is Wall Street and the financial sector, utilities, our air-traffic control system all of that, increasingly, is dependent on the digital base that they are working off of.

Well, it was certainly one of the most satisfying weeks not only for my Presidency, but I think for the United States since I have been ENTITY. Obviously bin Laden had been not only a symbol of terrorism, but a mass murderer who is eluded justice for so long, and so many families who had been affected I think had given up hope. And for us to be able to definitively say, We got the man who caused thousands of deaths here in the United States and who had been the rallying point for a violent extremist jihad around the world was something that I think all of us were profoundly grateful to be a part of. Was the decision to launch this attack the most difficult decision that you have made as Commander-In-Chief? You know, every time I send young men and women into a war theatre, that is a tough decision. And, you know, whenever you go to Walter Reed or Bethesda and you see the price that our young people pay to keep this country safe, that is a tough decision. Whenever you write a letter to a family who is lost a loved one. This was a very difficult decision, in part because the evidence that we had was not absolutely conclusive. Obviously it entailed enormous risk to the guys that I sent in there. But ultimately I had so much confidence in the capacity of our guys to carry out the mission that I felt that the risks were outweighed by the potential benefit of us finally getting our man. When the CIA first brought this information to you . . . Did this look promising from the very beginning? It did look promising from the beginning. Keep in mind that obviously when I was still campaigning for ENTITY, I had said that if I ever get a shot at bin Laden we are gonna take it. And I was subject to some criticism at the time, because I had said if it is in Pakistan and, you know, we do not have the ability to capture 'em in any other way, then we are gonna go ahead and take the shot. So I felt very strongly that there was a strategic imperative for us to go after him. Shortly after I got into office, I brought Leon Panetta privately into the Oval Office and I said to him, We need to redouble our efforts in hunting bin Laden down.

But I think in many instances, when you sat down with those people and pointed out what the change in rates did, some of their hostility disappeared. I think the most important thing that we are going to face is, once we have settled on and agreed on a package that we believe is fair and is the reform that is needed, is then to make sure there is no misunderstanding or lack of understanding of what it will actually mean to the taxpayer. Basically, we found that the overwhelming majority of people were going to get a sizable decrease in taxes, based roughly on this setup, and that those that were not were going to get an increase were people who, as I say, are not presently paying their fair share. More generally on the economy, you have made it pretty clear that you believe that we are on the brink of a sustained economic boom. Are you worried that this might be cut short by the Federal Reserve? And would you like to have a greater say in Federal Reserve policy? Well, we try to work very closely, as closely as we can, with the Federal Reserve on this. And so far, I must say, right now they are on target-and that is we need a money supply that is commensurate to the growth in the economy and to continue that growth without inflation. And that provides two lines between which you must stay. And so far, as I say, right now they are right on target with that. Were you comfortable back in July and August? I think there were some times when it fluctuated widely and when they got well below their target and all. But, as I say, we are trying to stay in close touch with them. And I think we have made it plain what we believe. There are times when it is not an outright decision of theirs that sees the money supply fluctuating, and the fluctuations can be caused from other and outside forces.

So I am moving as quickly as I can on this, and I hope that the Members of the Congress will all be as supportive as Congresswoman Lynn Schenk has been of this project, because if we had more folks like her who were willing to fund this project at higher levels, we can move even more quickly and help even more California working people. This being a Navy-Marine town, there is concern that our military be prepared for anything in the future. What can you say to that as far as defense conversion and our ability to be prepared for future contingencies? The head of naval research was here today with me, Admiral Pelaez. He made the point that in a very profound way, this program we announced will help to keep our defense strong, because we know that the defense budget's going to be reduced. This program will help to use the commercial research and development sector to keep the defense technology strong, even as we are using defense technologies to create jobs in the commercial sector. That is, by putting the two together, we will be able to get a bigger bang for our defense dollar. So that even though there will be some reduction in defense spending, we will be able to keep ahead of all of the other countries in the world and as far as we need to be on technology. Could you give us an idea of the control of this money in some defense contractors? Jobs have been cut, profits go up, and then bonuses are given to top executives. Well, first of all, let me explain what happens now. We have announced the projects that were worthy and that won the right to participate in this project. Now, what will happen is the group of people from our Government's side who work in this area will negotiate with each and every company to make sure that they put up their share of the money and to determine how they will spend this money. This money, in almost every case, is not an overwhelming amount of money for these companies.

What do you think is the most important problem facing the United States in the next decade, and what ideas do you have for dealing with it? Well, I think the problem remains-and it is a group of problems-and that is maintaining and continuing this expansion of our economy, so that we can provide jobs with a future and opportunity for all of our people. I think it is the problem of achieving a lasting peace, with the reduction, particularly, of nuclear weapons in the world, to reduce and, hopefully, one day eliminate that threat that hangs over us. I think others-to help, as we can, those nations that are trying to establish democracies and become working members of the family of nations. And, I believe, the restoration of some traditional values of family and neighborhood. The distortion that is occurred down through the last few decades of the relationship within our own country of our different levels of government, and to restore authority and autonomy to those levels where the Federal Government has assumed too much of it. I will probably think of several more answers to that later, but- but right now, I think that is covered basically: the economy, the economic expansion that is needed and that we have embarked on, and peace in the world and reduction of the tensions and the armaments. Sir, on the deficit question, I noticed yesterday you joked slightly about it and then emphasized how seriously you take the deficit problem. How serious a problem is it, and what would you do to deal with it? Well, that would be a part of the overall generic answer that I gave about the economy. Yes, the deficit is a problem; no one can ignore it. But it is been going on for some 50 years, and for most of that time, almost totally in that time, it has been a deliberate part of government policy. And some of us who complained about it back through the years always said that it would get literally out of control, that you could not go on that way without coming to a day of reckoning. And we now are at that day of reckoning. I think the basic part of that deficit is due to government itself and the excessive share of the people's earnings, the gross national product that the government is taking.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevenrweismanandfrancisxclinesthenewyorktimesforeignand", "title": "Ronald Reagan Interview With Steven R.

We gather here today, the 200th anniversary of our independence, to commemorate their sacrifices even before we celebrate the glorious Declaration. Americans will remember the name of Valley Forge as long as the spirit of sacrifice lives within their hearts. Here the vein of iron in our national character was forged. In the 18th century the colonial American was far more free and far more prosperous than his European cousin. Englishmen regarded us with some envy as appropriate subjects to share their grinding tax burdens. After Concord Bridge and Breed's Hill, the British generals were impressed with our marksmanship and fighting spirit, but they still dismissed Washington's militiamen as a rabble of arms. Many years later, when he was 91, a veteran of Concord was interviewed and asked why he took up his rifle against his King. Well, then, what did all the fighting mean? We had always governed ourselves, and we always meant to. Without Jefferson's eloquence, those are the words of the American people's Declaration of Independence. That was the straight talk that brought some 11,000 ordinary Americans farmers, workers, tradesmen, and shopkeepers-into this valley of sacrifice in the bitter winter of 1777. They did not die amid the banners and the fearful sounds of battle. They weakened slowly and quietly succumbed to cold, sickness, and starvation. Yet their courage and suffering those who survived as well as those who fell-were no less meaningful than the sacrifices of those who manned the battlements of Boston and scaled the parapets of Yorktown. In the battle against despair, Washington and his men kept freedom's lonely vigil. The leader and the led drew strength and hope from one another. Around the winter campfires that dotted these fields, the flame of liberty was somehow kept burning. Something happened at Valley Forge.

If, on the other hand, these two are allowed to proceed in disregard one for the other, you then create a situation either of doubtful military strength, or of such precarious economic strength that your military position is in constant jeopardy. It has been the purpose of this administration ever since it took office, finding itself confronted with a crazy quilt of promises, commitments, and contracts, to bring American military logic and American economic logic into joint strong harness. No more glaring illustration of the lack of balance between the military logic and the economic logic could possibly be found than the situation that existed when we took office. On the one hand, we found our allies deploring our unfulfilled defense promises. On the other hand, we found there was a total carryover of $81 billion in appropriated funds, largely committed, for which cash must be provided from revenues in future fiscal years, over and above the normal annual cost of government. It is just as if the late administration had gone to the store and ordered 81 billion dollars worth of goods, which we have got to pay for as they are delivered, in addition to paying the regular household running expenses. The fiscal situation represented by these two extremes absolutely has to be brought into some kind of realistic focus, and the only way to do it is to have a completely new, fresh look without any misleading labels.

Are you going to try to bring back the cigarette tax? California has had a lot of success with that in their State. Well, this Congress would not adopt that. I have had a number of people who've come from tobacco countries suggest that some of the cigarette tax ought to be devoted to helping the farmers who want to convert their farmland to other purposes, to some sort of buy-out program. But I think that right now what we ought to do is-the bulk of the cigarette tax is available to the States, and a lot of the States now are passing cigarette taxes to help to pay for the health care bills of people who are suffering from tobacco-related illnesses. And I do not want to see the Congress and the Federal Government crowd that out. So when I proposed a tobacco tax before, it was to pay for health care. Right now, advertising is written off as a business expense, and that means the public pays in some fashion for all advertising, including cigarette advertising. Would you consider getting rid of the tax deduction for cigarette advertising? You are the first person who is ever suggested it to me. I'd never though of that. So I will give you a few minutes to absorb it, and I will come back. I have never thought of that. Because I think a lot of people would be offended by the idea of paying for an unhealthy product to advertise and garner more smokers through it. But I will let you dwell on it. Not only do you want to regulate tobacco products, but you are also in favor of regulating how they are marketed. When a musician sits down to talk with me and they are smoking a cigarette, should I not air that footage on MTV? Should I ask Keith Richards to put out his cigarette before he does an interview with me? Should this go for all television? Because of lot of young people watch MTV.

In closing, ENTITY, the broadcast media, some of them have been, I would say, almost brutal about your management style, but it is clearly working. Some other people are saying that your management style actually reflects sort of a new philosophy of management. I believe in, first of all, delegating to my Cabinet Departments decisions that are made consistent with my policies but which do not need to be made here. I believe in making big policy decisions myself, after you get everybody in with the best possible ideas and let them argue them out. I think the idea that somehow a President should be able to know off the top of his head and be able to make a snap decision on how to reverse 12 years of economic policies, 20 years of stagnant wages, and 30 years of social decline is a naive way of looking at things. And if you look at people-whatever people want to say about my management style, last year, according to Congressional Quarterly, we got more done with Congress than any administration since World War II, except for President Eisenhower in '53 and President Johnson in '65. We have reduced the Federal Government when the Republicans could not . We have increased the performance of the Federal Government. So I think our management style is producing pretty good results. We have got Russian missiles that are no longer pointed at the United States for the first time since World War II. We have got a lot of things going. And I just think that part of it is, people think in patterns, and they think with preconceived notions of how decisions should be made. And a lot of our preconceived patterns are rooted in the organization of our thoughts and attitudes and actions that came out of World War II and the cold war. Now we are moving toward the 21st century, when things are changing much more rapidly, when it requires a whole lot of knowledge from different sources to make good decisions, and when you are dealing with problems that developed over a long period of time and therefore may need some period of time to solve. In that sort of environment, a whole different decisionmaking process has to take hold. And you need to deal with different kinds of people and work in different ways to make things happen.

They are striver's values; they are the values that say we are going to make something of ourselves, regardless of the station in which we were born. When you look at second-generation immigrants, or third-generation immigrants, they are as American as any kid here. That is part of what separates us from the United Kingdom or Europe, is we have had that tradition of being a nation of immigrants. And so, you know, when people are concerned about some of the changes that immigrants may bring, you know, they need to go back and read what people were saying about their grandparents or great-grandparents when they came. You read about the description of Irish who arrived, and the language that is being used is identical to the language that Mr. Trump uses about Mexicans. You know, when Southern Europeans were coming instead of Northern Europeans, there was absolute certainty that America was going down the tubes because these swarthy, you know, folks were coming here and they had different attitudes. And Catholics were coming, which meant that the pope was going to control us. And - this kind of xenophobia is part of the American tradition, and the good news is that, you know, after these spasms of it, it typically fades away, because the immigrants who come here, in fact, are coming here precisely to embrace the opportunities of being American. Is there a danger that Europe, after this Brexit vote, will turn inward, focus increasingly on its own problems and its own turmoil, and be less active in the world? Well, I think that the best way to think about this is a pause button has been pressed on the project of full European integration. I would not overstate it. There has been a little bit of hysteria post-Brexit vote, as if, somehow, NATO's gone and the trans-Atlantic alliance is dissolving and every country is rushing off to its own corner.

And that reminds me that 30 years is just too long a time to elapse between Republican Presidents. And that is a sentiment which I think Mr. Hoover would share. Ladies and gentlemen, as I listened to the statistics with which I was overwhelmed by General--and we called him Slam Marshall--I had the feeling it was a rather good thing he did not know all those figures, and give them to me somewhere along about December of 1944. I would have been so impressed that I think my mind would have been taken off the war. And certainly it is enlightening, even at this late date, to find out exactly what such devoted and professionally competent people achieved. And indeed it was the confidence of military men that our technical and professional people could do this. That was at the bottom of the plan that came later to be known as Operation Overlord. This plan came finally to a preliminary state of completion in about April of 1942. It was placed before General Marshall and all of the possibilities were explained to him, and he approved and later got the approval, of course, of the President and the British counterparts. But they also had the great faith that the American engineering profession could provide us the equipment and the materiel that would be needed, finally, for victory. There are one or two incidents that General Marshall did not mention. I am not going to go too deeply into statistics, but there is a story--a true one--that I thought always was interesting. The American engineers equipped with the kind of mechanisms such as he mentioned , went over to Malta; and there was a British air officer, General Park, a very competent and gallant man, who knew that the Americans needed a new fighter field fight close by. The only spot that was possible to use was an island and I think it was named Gozo, but if I am wrong General Gruenther will tell me after we leave this meeting. But anyway it was nothing but a mountain. And the British having long ago given up with their hand tools on building this field, said to the engineer colonel visiting for the evening, How long would it take you to get this field ready? And the British thought, at least, that anything under a year, if you could do it at all, would be all right.

And I suspect he might have thought, Well, he is just trying to get me out of the Oval Office. But I meant what I said, and I want to thank the United States Congress for joining with the administration. We have committed over $110 billion to help the people in the gulf coast.

The road to recovery is long and difficult, but we will continue to work together to implement the strategy that Bruce and I worked on, along with people other people like Donna Brazile and other leaders. We have got a plan, and we have got a commitment.

How do you compromise on something like granting liability for a telecommunications company? If we do not give liability protection to those who are helping us, they will not help us.

And there are some people that think the ratio's even higher than that. But I will tell you, if you look at this thing over a 5-year period we have more spending cuts than we do tax increases. And that is true even though we have some targeted increases in investment, in education and training, and new technologies. Now, the people who argue this the other way, they play clever games. For example, if you are going to cut a program that is in place, you may have to phase in the cuts over a 5-year period; if you raise a tax, you can raise a tax immediately. You have got to look at this whole budget. In this budget we have more spending cuts than tax increases. We do have some spending increases, but if you do not believe that there are differences in different kinds of spending, I do not know what we can do. We have some spending increases to give a nationwide apprenticeship program to help retrain the work force. We have some spending increases to get into new technologies to make up for defense cuts because we are losing a lot of high-tech, highwage jobs. You know, up in Connecticut we have had a lot of employment dislocation because of defense cutbacks, but you have got a whole highwage work force that needs to have something else to do.

I share your frustration, and I am determined to see things changed. I am convinced that a balanced budget amendment is the only way to force the Federal Government, both the Congress and the executive branch, to live within its means.

We are treating our national debt like the old fellow who borrowed money to pay off his loans. Inevitably, someone at some time must foot the bill. It is simply wrong to walk away from this mountain of debt and leave it to our kids. Forty-four of our States have some kind of a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget. It is time for the Federal Government to follow their lead. We must balance the Federal budget without shifting the funding burden along to the States. We must pay our own way. Our future is at stake. Now is the time to pass a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget. Let me caution Americans not to be taken in by bold blustering. We cannot wheel and deal the deficit away. There is no easy answer that we can jot out on a blank sheet of paper to wipe out a deficit of that magnitude. We should not be willing to risk our grandchildren's future on sound bites that merely sound real. A constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget is what is needed.

{"id": 5115, "text": "We are going to have a full agenda in the second four years, but people should not underestimate how much we can get done. Obviously, I'd love to see a shift in Congress where we are electing people who are less interested in the next election and obstruction and are more interested in getting stuff done. I just want to make sure that there are people who have some sense of service toward their constituencies. If you could single-handedly enact one piece of regulation on the financial industry, what would it be? The story of Dodd-Frank is not yet complete, because the rules are still being developed. Dodd-Frank provided a platform to make sure that we end some of the most egregious practices and prevent another taxpayer-funded bailout. We have significantly increased capital requirements and essentially created a wind-down mechanism for institutions that make bad bets, so the whole system is not held hostage to them going under. We have to make sure that the rules issued around the Volcker Rule are actually enforced. So there is a lot of good work that will be done around Dodd-Frank. I have looked at some of Rolling Stone's articles that say, This did not go far enough, we did not institute Glass-Steagall and so forth, and I pushed my economic team very hard on some of those questions. So the problem in today's financial sector cannot be solved simply by reimposing models that were created in the 1930s. I will tell you, the single biggest thing that I would like to see is changing incentives on Wall Street and how people get compensated. That ultimately requires not just congressional legislation but a change in corporate governance. You still have a situation where people making bets can get a huge upside, and their downsides are limited. So it tilts the whole system in favor of very risky behavior. I think a legitimate concern, even after Dodd-Frank, is, Have we completely changed those incentives?

But before we do, I wanted to say that after I got back on the plane, I called Prime Minister Rabin and ENTITY Mubarak to report on my meeting with Asad, and I attempted to call but was unsuccessful in reaching King Fahd I am going to talk to him probably tomorrow morning just to tell them what had gone on in the meeting and what the statement was and get their sense of what was going to happen. Rabin had watched it live. Rabin had watched it live. I think he did, but we had kind of a staticy connection, so I could not be sure. But everybody seemed to be pretty positive about it. Anyway, looking back over the trip, I can say without any hesitation that it certainly met all of our objectives when we went on the trip. And I think there were basically three big elements to it. The first was the prospect of really uniting Europe for the first time since nations have been on the landscape there. I am very encouraged by the initial reaction to the Partnership For Peace. Russia, Ukraine expressed an interest. We have now heard some interest from Romania. So I am feeling quite good about that. Even the Swiss said they wanted to think about whether there was some way they could support it even if they did not join, given their historic neutrality. I feel very good about it. The second important thing, of course, was the nuclear breakthrough, the agreement with Ukraine following the agreement that had been reached earlier in the year with Belarus and Kazakhstan, not having our nuclear weapons targeted at anybody, not having their nuclear weapons targeted at us. And we also had some important discussions with the Russians about going in and making sure that START I is completely ratified and implemented and that START II is ratified and implemented and that we keep thinking about what further steps there ought to be. So this was a very good meeting trip in that respect. And then the third aspect of the trip was the whole movement toward not only uniting Europe economically and politically but kind of getting growth back into the system.

Secretary Hodges is a distinguished American who has served his State and his Nation and has in his entire lifetime given to the American people the best that is in him always for the benefit of his beloved country. His stewardship of the Commerce Department was both progressive and prudent. I have accepted Secretary Hodges' resignation with deep regret because he is not only a good and wise American but he is. But the American system that produced Luther Hodges has within its gifts the capacity to produce a man to take his place. I have elected to ask the Senate to give their advice and consent to my nomination of John T. Connor of New Jersey to be Secretary of Commerce. I truly believe that John Connor is an authentic example of what the American educational and free enterprise system can create. Until yesterday he was the president of Merck & Company, one of the Nation's leading pharmaceutical firms. He was on the board of directors of General Motors and General Foods, and other leading boards. He is a leader on the Committee for Economic Development and the Business Advisory Council. He is not unacquainted with the ways of Washington. In 1942 he was the General Counsel for the Office of Scientific Research and Development, at that time headed by the distinguished American, Vannevar Bush. In 1945 he became counsel to the new Office of Naval Research, and later special assistant to the late, respected James Forrestal. In between times he served as a rugged Marine and reached the rank of captain. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1936 magna cum laude, and from Harvard Law School in 1939. I might add that he was not backward in his studies. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. John Connor is the kind of man I am proud to have serve in the Cabinet. He will never discard a principle nor despair of doing what is right and ought to be done. I think the credentials that he bears in his heart and in his mind are the kind of credentials that will make his Nation proud and will cause great achievements to be his legacy in the country that he has served so well and in the Nation that he loves. I now present to you Mr. Connor. I have asked the new Secretary of Commerce to meet and work with the Secretary of Labor and the voice of American labor in this country, Mr. George Meany.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstelevisedceremonymarkingthechangeleadershipthedepartmentcommerce", "title": "Remarks at a Televised Ceremony Marking the Change in Leadership at the Department of Commerce.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-televised-ceremony-marking-the-change-leadership-the-department-commerce", "publication_date": "16-12-1964", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Lyndon B.

In the context of his visit to India just last month, the President spent a lot of time with Prime Minister Modi and they spent a lot of time talking about some of these economic issues. You will recall that there was a CEO summit in the context of those meeting, and that there were American and Indian business leaders that spent some time talking through some of these issues. And the President himself had the opportunity to sit down at a roundtable with a couple dozen of them and talk about some of the challenges that they face as they try to do more business together in a way that benefits the economies and job creation in both countries.

Do you think that all the campaigning among eight contenders for the Democratic nomination has changed public perception of you along those lines or along other lines on Well, even before a campaign started, this has been pretty much the theme of the other side. I have been held up as eating my young, that we have been hostile to the poor and our tax program benefits the rich. How can a program that cuts taxes evenly, percentagewise, across the board-thus leaving the same rate of progression in our progressive tax system-how can that be beneficial to the rich and detrimental to the others? How can it be unfair to the people of lower income or the poor to reduce inflation from double digits-12.5 percent when we came here-down to a third of that or less, less than a third of that. When the people with the least-let us take someone with $10,000 of income between-through 2 years, 1979 and 1980-before we got here. By the end of 1980 that $10,000 would only buy $8,000 worth. He was getting $5,000 a year. He got a $1,000 cut in his ability to buy each year. That was probably the worst tax on the elderly with fixed incomes, the worst tax on the poor who have to spend most of their earnings on subsistence, on the necessities. The person with luxury income who spends a minor portion of it on necessities and the rest on luxuries, they were not really penalized as much by inflation. So, I think everything we have done has been beneficial to everyone at every level. You mention the elderly. If I could ask about that.

That is one thing I think the Bush administration will be in a position to do, because of the development of our relationships, I will be-I expect that President Putin and then-President Bush will be successful in continuing to reduce the nuclear arsenals. But you do not want to have all this sort of uncontrolled instability in some other part of the world.

That keeps interest rates down. That is a tax cut for everybody. His plan will keep interest rates a percent lower for a decade. That is $390 billion in lower home mortgages alone, $30 billion in lower car payments, $15 billion in lower college loan payments, and more business loans, more jobs, a stronger stock market. So I think-so he says, Pay the debt down first. Then take what you have got left and invest it in education, health care, the environment, national security, and a tax cut. And the opposition says, Well, we have got this money. Let us give it back to the people. If the surplus is $2 trillion, they propose to spend, what, about $1.5 trillion on a tax cut, plus interest, and then $1 trillion to partially privatize Social Security, and $.5 trillion-those are big numbers. But if you think the surplus is $2 billion and you spend $1.5 billion on taxes, $1 billion on privatizing Social Security, and $.5 billion on spending, you are in deficit. That means higher interest rates. Do I want this big tax cut now and this privatization now, and do I think it will be so good that it is worth going back into deficits and having higher interest rates? I think from my point of view, the arithmetic here is very important, and it is really pretty simple. You can forget about all the zeros, and you just think that if you drop all the zeros, whatever you spend and whatever you cut taxes cannot add up to more than two. If it does, you are not paying down the debt as you should.

And Presidents ought not to do this, but I know who I am rooting for. But above all, Barbara and I wanted to come over and thank the Points of Light that we are honoring today. I know that many of them have gone to great efforts to get here. And lots of folks ask me about the phrase, Points of Light. And some say it is religion; others say, well, it is a patriotic theme, like the flag; and others think it is an image of hope. But I think that Points of Light are all of these things and yet still something more. It is what happens when ordinary people claim the problems of their community as their own. And it is the inspiration and awakening to the God-given light from within, lit from within, and it is the promise of America.

ENTITY, your administration, you just said, offers a lot to Russia to gain acceptance, Russia's acceptance to idea building--missile shield. And at the same time, so far, it does not seem that you offer much to Poland, which is supposed to host the interceptor site. How would you convince people in Poland, who are frankly not that much afraid of uranium threat, but they are listening to the threats from Russia very carefully? First of all, Poland and the U.S. are in NATO, and an attack on one is an attack on all. We cannot offer any better security agreement than that, and we mean it. If you are an ally of the United States and NATO and you feel threatened by an outside force, we will help you. I do not believe that there would be-I would certainly hope that Poland will not be threatened again by an outside force. I can understand why people in Poland could be nervous about that. After all, it is been a terrible part of your history. But as an ally in NATO, I cannot make a stronger statement than to say we stand with you, and in this case, this ally actually means it, and so do NATO allies. You know, I am sure there is probably some skepticism from some older folks or those who study history, where Poland had been given assurances and those assurances did not come through. Well, in this case, they will. I do not view Poland as being under any military threat. Obviously, there are differences you have with Russia over meat, and I am very aware of that. It is an EU matter; it is a matter that Angela Merkel is working hard, as the head of the EU at this point in time, to address that problem. The best way to compensate Poland for our friendship is to have good, strong bilateral relations. As you know, we have worked hard on different agreements that would help create jobs.

Our position is, is that we want to know the truth, and we expect all parties to be forthcoming with the truth. The truth is really important to help Lebanon meet a goal that we want for Lebanon, which is free of foreign interference, democratic and peaceful, so that people can realize dreams and so the great country of Lebanon can grow and prosper like I am confident it can. So the United States will constantly remind all parties that we seek the truth, and we expect parties, when asked about the truth, to be forthcoming with the truth. I am worried about people who stall and hope that the world turns a blind eye to a terrible death. And we are not going to turn a blind eye. We will keep focused on this important issue, because we believe in the future of Lebanon. From what you say, many in Lebanon fear that there might be a deal between Washington and Damascus. In other words, if Damascus complied with Washington demands regarding Iraq, regarding Hizballah and Hamas, would you let the inquiry not reach its ultimate? Part of our desires for Damascus is, of course, to shut down terrorist bases in their country, and is, of course, to stop cross-border infiltration into Iraq, is, of course, to stop allowing people to find safe haven to plot and plan attacks in the neighborhood. But part of our demands was to-was 1559, which is, completely out of Lebanon. We are people who believe that when we say something, we have got to keep our word.

I was looking at the records the other day, and I have been in Charlotte three times in the last 2 years. The last time I was here was in May of 1975. At that time, Jim Martin assembled 105,000 of his closest friends to meet me at the Mecklenburg County Bicentennial celebration. It was a great occasion, and I enjoyed it very, very much. You gave me a very, very warm welcome at that time, and I certainly appreciated that enthusiastic reception.

While I am here, I think it appropriate that I say a few words in a salute to some of the other distinguished guests who are here. First, I think it is a very opportune time for me to wish Jim Martin's mother a very happy birthday, which I understand will take place tomorrow. Mom and Pop Martin are well known in Washington because of their very well-known son. Jim is every bit as proud of you, Mrs. Martin, as I am sure you are of him.

And I know what a superb job he did, what a hard struggle he made year after year after year to try and get some sense and responsibility in the consideration of the various appropriation bills, but particularly the Labor and HEW appropriation bills.

And you spoke with the new Prime Minister, Mr. Berlusconi. So my question is, how is your sense about Mr. Berlusconi and his policy and the implementation of his policy-the first new government in Italy? Well, my sense was that he had given a lot of thought to what he wished to do and that he was bringing a great deal of energy to the task and that he was determined to pursue a course of economic revival for Italy and to maintain a strong democratic tradition and that, in terms of our relationships, that the traditional strong relationship between the United States and Italy would be maintained vigorously. May I follow up with a question that connects to Italy very quickly? We are in the front line. And one of the first requests of the government of Italy, Mr. Berlusconi's government, was to let Italy get in the contact group that is working in Geneva. Do you think this request will be evaluated, accepted, on what? Let me say first, I think that Italy should be very closely consulted about all developments in Bosnia and in the former Yugoslavia. In other words, if the membership were expanded, would every country that has troops there-Canada has troops there, would they have to go into the contact group? Would other countries that border the former Yugoslavia and have intense interests there-Turkey is sending troops there-have to be put into the contact group? Excuse a parochial question, but as you know, we have had two trade agreements in the last couple of years between Canada and the United States. And yet, our trade problems seem to be deteriorating, if anything, over softwood lumber and wheat and now Pacific salmon, so much so, that our Trade Minister, Roy MacLaren, has warned of a trade show between our two countries. And even your Ambassador to Ottawa has criticized U.S. actions on wheat. Do you think the time has come for you to become personally involved on this issue before it deteriorates much further? First of all, keep in mind, this is the biggest bilateral trading relationship in the world, as far as I know.

And as confidence is built, as institutions are in place, I assured Prime Minister Abbas-and this was important for Prime Minister Sharon to hear as well-that there is going to be a lot of help, financial help, from around the world. Let me just go around the table. I am cautious, because- and I am cautious because history tells you to be cautious. I do not know where you were in 2000. There are people who have declared their-openly declared their hostility to Israel and their desire to destroy Israeli citizens. There are people that, you know, would rather have chaos than a state.

It is Wolf and a team of people that the Secretary will be glad to explain to you. We have a security team there to help the Dahlan.

They were talking about NATO and all of this. How would you feel about the Communists taking the leadership in Italy?

I cannot quite believe that the Italian people, with their love of independence and freedom, would settle for what the Communist government would mean to them and would take away from them.

Well, I am going to have to fight back, because, first of all, the bulk of the defense budget is for personnel and readiness. We have men and women in uniform in our volunteer military that a couple of years ago, it was a disgrace. We were acting as if we were still in a war and they were draftees. Those with families found themselves eligible for welfare. Now we have increased the pay for those people to something comparable with what they are doing.

And so we need to continue the focus on costs. We are making some good progress, by the way, about helping people with health care. We have got what we call community health centers in America. I am committed to the expansion and the building of new community health centers. These are places where people who do not have insurance or live in areas without enough doctors can find health care. Community health centers make sense. It takes the pressure off the emergency rooms of hospitals such as this. We have opened or expanded 600 community health centers since 2001. This is a good way to make sure that health care is available for those who do not have insurance yet.

I was proud to sign that bill, and as I told the Congress, If you try to change it and it hurts our seniors, I will veto the bill. It is going to take a while to implement the Medicare bill. It is a complex piece of legislation. After all, it is the first modernization since Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare in the mid-sixties.

But as I said, you know, there were sufficient risks involved where it was not as if any of the folks who were voicing doubts were voicing something that I was not already running through in my own head. You know, we understood that there were some significant risks involved in this. How much did some of the past failures, like the Iran hostage rescue attempt, how did that weigh on you?

You did not want failure but after looking at . . . the 55/45 thing that you mentioned, you must have at some point concluded that the advantages outweighed the risks . . . .

And I said to myself that if we have a good chance of not completely defeating but badly disabling al Qaeda, then it was worth both the political risks as well as the risks to our men.

And so, in 15 years' time, whoever is occupying my chair here in the White House will have more information about their nuclear program, will have greater international legitimacy in the event that the President needs to initiate a strike against Iran's nuclear program, will have the justification of them explicitly having violated international agreements that they entered into. And so the notion that somehow we are better off confronting that problem right now, rather than having 15 full years in which to monitor, learn about their program and be assured that they do not have a nuclear weapon does not make much sense. There is no scenario in which, in the absence of a nuclear weapon, Iran will be able to match the United States, Israel and its various Gulf allies if they tried to break out and get a bomb. We hope that by virtue of them interacting with the world's community on a more regular basis commercially, that that may moderate their behavior, but we are not counting on it. And the backstop to this agreement throughout is that we, the United States, are not giving up any of our capacity to respond if and when they pose a national security threat to us or they pose a national security threat to our friends and allies in the region, particularly Israel. So let us talk about Israel for a moment. Unquestionably, your administration has given unprecedented military and strategic support to Israel. But it is also apparent that the relationship in many ways between the United States and Israel, between the governments and even, in some cases, between some peoples, has grown toxic. And I am wondering now, looking forward, what do you think the Israeli government can do to repair this? What can your administration do? And what can American Jews do? The relationships between our peoples, the shared values, the shared commitment to democracy , those things are so deep that they have survived arguments in the past and they will survive this argument. And so I understand the anxiety that it causes. But I think a testament to how sturdy the relationship is, is that despite this very significant policy disagreement, all the military, security, commercial, cultural cooperation that existed before this debate came up has continued unabated and will continue unabated.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjaneeisnerforward", "title": "Interview with Jane Eisner of FORWARD", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jane-eisner-forward", "publication_date": "28-08-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

If one country is going to practice great inflation, their dollar is going to be weak. And currencies are going to be stabilized when we conquer inflation. Regarding the INF talks, in Germany there is a growing concern that the United States is not negotiating seriously enough. Among the critics is our former Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt. What can you tell the Germans in this regard? And why cannot you accept the Nitze-Kvitsinskiy outline limiting the West to 75 cruise missiles and reducing the Soviet SS-20's, also, to 75? In our country, a lot of people think we could have lived with this. Incidentally, we have been in full consultation with the leaders of all of your countries on the INF negotiations and will do nothing without consulting first with them. This has been one of the great steps forward that I think we have made in these last 2 years. And I have had the gratitude expressed by your leaders for the fact that we are in this close contact on all these major issues. I do not know that the walk in the woods would have been acceptable even to the Soviet Union with its proposal. But let me point out something. The SS-20 has three warheads each, so it would be three times 75. It also, once the button is pushed, arrives at the target in about 5 to 7 minutes. The cruise missile is an in-flight vehicle that would be in the air, you might say, in a matter of hours and is, therefore, subject to the same kind of conventional defensive weaponry-anti-aircraft type weaponry, picked up on radar and aimed by radar and so forth-that an airplane would be. It was not very much of a deterrent. And what we are seeking is not a counter weapon that we want to use against the Soviet Union. We are seeking a deterrent. The closest thing is the Pershing II missile, which the allied countries asked for.

But it will also mean an increased military role, probably. It could, but it may not require an increased military budget. That is, all of our militaries are doing different things. On the budget, let me say-this is one other point I should make-there are costs for Europeans and costs for Americans in expanding NATO, and it is important, therefore, to make a good military decision because you have to justify the costs to the public. That is why it cannot simply be about politics, because we have to-we are all obliged to do certain things to keep the military able to work with one another; the term of art is interoperability. ENTITY, I think it would be interesting to know how you did convince President Yeltsin three instead of five. Is it the price that you paid to get yes from Mr. Yeltsin? I would not say that, but I think that it is important to note that we made an agreement with President Yeltsin to have an agreement between NATO and Russia that would make it crystal clear that NATO is no longer an organization designed to contain Russia; NATO is an organization designed to work with all free countries to respect the territorial integrity of its members, to protect the security of its members, and to work with its members and their allies, Russia, soon to be Ukraine, and those in the Partnership For Peace, on common security problems like the problem in Bosnia. I think the great contribution Boris Yeltsin has made to the integration of Europe is his willingness to say, Russia is not going to define its greatness in terms of territorial domination, Russia will define its greatness in terms of the achievements of its people and its partnerships with other countries. That was the contribution, that is what he did, and he deserves a lot of credit for that. Now, should we expand NATO in a way that is at least aware of the nationalist elements in Russia, the people that do not feel the same way? Should we be sensitive to that? But I think as NATO and Russia continue to work in partnership as we have in Bosnia, the continued expansion of NATO will not be seen as a threat to the Russian people but will be seen as something that reinforces our partnership and therefore makes the Russian people more secure.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwitheuropeantelevisionjournalists", "title": "Interview With European Television Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-european-television-journalists", "publication_date": "03-07-1997", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

I want to emphasize today that what I seek, contrary to the attacks, and what you have sought, is not a Government-run health system, it is a private insurance health system that covers everybody, where the health care professionals run it and not the insurance companies. That is what we seek. We seek private insurance that can never be taken away. It is wrong to treat seriously ill children in an emergency room who could have been treated more easily and more inexpensively if their parents had just had the coverage. With our reforms, every family will have that kind of quality insurance. We ought to reform the insurance system that today often only covers the healthiest people and even then will deny them coverage for anything they have been sick with before. When you go to a patient's bedside, you ask, Why does it hurt? If you think about all this preexisting condition business, there are 81 million Americans who live in families where there is been a child with diabetes or a mother that had cancer prematurely or a father that had an early heart attack or some other problem. I see these people everywhere. Now, we get action lickety-split up here all the time when a million people or 2 million people are adversely affected by something if they are well organized.

Is there something in what he says? We had the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. We could be growing even faster than we have if Governor Romney's allies in Congress would move on some of the things that we have recommended. I will give you an example. On housing, right now we could make sure that families whose homes are underwater, where they owe more than their mortgage or more than their house is worth, if they refinance, typically they get 3,000 bucks in their pockets a year. That is $3,000 they are spending  or $3,000 that they are putting back into equity in their home. Governor Romney opposes it. But do not you have a HAMP program?

They will benefit from a lower but more certain tax rate. It also allows us then to close some of the loopholes that permit companies to artificially shift profits overseas so they are avoiding tax compliance. It would allow us potentially to have companies who have profits overseas to start bringing some of those profits back and reinvesting in the United States.

As Administrator, Mary led efforts to improve safety and security, reduce traffic congestion, and modernize America's roads and bridges. And before coming to Washington, Mary served in the Arizona Department of Transportation for more than 15 years, rising through the ranks to become the director in 1998. Mary has a reputation for character and common sense. She knows how to set priorities and to solve problems.

And since then, he is worked to strengthen the security at America's airports and seaports. He is played a critical role in keeping America safe from terrorist attacks. Norm also worked hard to modernize the aviation market. And after Hurricane Katrina, Norm and his team swung into action to repair and reopen major highways and seaports and airports and pipelines along America's gulf coast.

ENTITY, you are bringing out a new budget next week, and I presume you are going to have healthcare, health insurance plan in it. To pay for some of the plan, some people who do not pay taxes on their health insurance plan now will have to pay taxes. Is not that a tax increase for them? No, really what it is, it is a rewriting of the tax code. We have got a tax code today that says if you get your insurance from a large employer, for example, it is part of your - it is a non-taxable event. And yet if you are an individual, like ENTITY out there as an independent contractor, and you buy your own health insurance, you are at a tax disadvantage. And so I am asking the Congress to reform the tax code to treat everybody fairly. And in my judgment, such a plan will encourage and enable more individuals to be able to buy health insurance, which will help us deal with the uninsured. Will the budget be balanced through spending restraint or taxes? The budget is going to be balanced by keeping taxes low. In other words, we are not going to raise taxes. And as a result of keeping taxes low, the economy is doing just fine, and when the economy is doing well, it yields a certain level of tax revenues that we can live with. And then making sure that we constrain federal spending, and you do that by setting priorities. And our priority has got to be this global war on terror and supporting our troops, and protecting the homeland, and that is what our budget will say, and we can balance the budget within five years. And that is going to be - that is good for the country. And in so doing, we are dealing with the short-term deficits, but we have also got to deal with the long-term deficits inherent in, for example, programs like Social Security and Medicare.

In regard to free trade agreement, do you have any specific plan to persuade the Congress leadership into moving forward the approval of FTA within this year? First of all, the goal is to get it done this year. I told your President I would like to get it done this year. I am constantly talking about the importance of a free trade agreement with Korea to our interests. Yesterday I met with important business leaders of the Korean-U.S. Business Dialogue Council. I, one, made it clear to them that I am very much for this, and secondly, I made it clear to them that we have got to work a common strategy, that they have got to help us, on Capitol Hill, move the issue.

And I want to thank you all for coming. I appreciate our visit. I appreciate the chance to hear your point of view about what we need to do together to get this bill passed. I want to thank the members of my Cabinet who are here. I particularly want to say thanks to Ambassador Rob Portman, who is the U.S. Trade Representative. He is the point person in the Bush administration to get this bill passed. He is working smart, and with your help and the help of those on the stage, I am confident that Congress will do the right thing. The reason we are here is because we share an interest in promoting opportunity and prosperity here at home. All of us understand that strengthening our economic ties with our democratic neighbors is a vital issue of national importance. All of us urge Congress to pass the agreement because America has an interest in strengthening democracy and advancing prosperity in our hemisphere. One of the surest ways to strengthen democracy and advance prosperity is by establish a trading system based on clear rules. My predecessors from both parties, former Presidents from both political parties, pursued this goal at all levels-at the global level, at the bilateral level, and at the regional level. Today, CAFTA presents us with an historic opportunity to advance a free and fair trading system that will bring benefits to all sides. I want to thank the members of the diplomatic corps from Central America who have joined us today. These Ambassadors understand what I just said. I said, this trade agreement benefits both sides. It is a good deal for the CAFTA countries, and it is a good deal for America as well. It is a good deal for America because CAFTA will help level the playing field for our goods and services. Under existing rules, nearly 80 percent of imports from Central America and the Dominican Republic already enter the United States duty free. But U.S. exports into the region face heavy tariffs. 80 percent of goods produced in Central America come into our country, come into the United States duty-free.

The real problem is to awaken this consciousness, this moral sense, and if necessary to segregate such degenerate minds where they can do no future harm. to investigate our existing agencies of enforcement and to reorganize our system of enforcement in such manner as to eliminate its weaknesses. It is the purpose of the Federal administration systematically to strengthen its law enforcement agencies week by week, month by month, year by year, not by dramatic displays and violent attacks in order to make headlines, not by violating the law itself through misuse of the law in its enforcement, but by steady pressure, steady weeding out of all incapable and negligent officials no matter what their status; by encouragement, promotion, and recognition for those who do their duty; and by the most rigid scrutiny of the records and attitudes of all persons suggested for appointment to official posts in our entire law enforcement machinery. That is administration for which my colleagues and I are fully responsible so far as the human material which can be assembled for the task will permit. Furthermore, I wish to determine and, as far as possible, remove the scores of inherent defects in our present system that defeat the most devoted officials. Every student of our law enforcement mechanism knows full well that it is in need of vigorous reorganization; that its procedure unduly favors the criminal; that our judiciary needs to be strengthened; that the method of assembling our juries needs revision; that justice must be more swift and sure. In our desire to be merciful the pendulum has swung in favor of the prisoner and far away from the protection of society. The sympathetic mind of the American people in its overconcern about those who are in difficulties has swung too far from the family of the murdered to the family of the murderer. With a view to enlisting public understanding, public support, accurate determination of the facts, and constructive conclusions, I have proposed to establish a national commission to study and report upon the whole of our problems involved in criminal-law enforcement. That proposal has met with gratifying support, and I am sure it will have the cooperation of the bar associations and crime commissions in our various States in the widespread effort now being made by them.

How are you going to make sure during national service, when it gets going, that they serve side by side? Well, those are the kinds of projects we will favor. But I think if you look all across the world today, there is always going to be some ethnic cohesion. People are going to pull together, talk together, feel a greater initial comfort level.

Yes, in the first year, those who have insurance may pay more, depending on whether they work for small or big businesses. Very young people who are basically in plans that have big businesses insuring them may pay some more in the first year. Even they, however, within 5 years should be paying less, because we slow the rate of growth in these premiums. Young people who work for small businesses probably will not pay more because they are paying too much already, all small businesses. And they will be in great big groups. But I would also point out that an awful lot of young people who do not have health insurance-and some young people do have access; some young people do get sick; some young people even have serious illnesses-so it will help them. And I would say, also, to all these young people, if we change it in this way so that we are all rated as a community, what it means is, is that some family gets a sick child, it means that they will not lose their health insurance if they change jobs, or they will not be locked into the job they are in.

Maybe they did not like me, but I think mostly what they did not like was the prospect that they would not win the White House forever and ever and ever. I think it is not too much to say that before the '92 election, they really thought they had found a formula and there would never be another Democratic President, not for a long, long, long time, that maybe a third party would have to come up before they'd ever be challenged.

And the environment in which our people live and, therefore, in which our Government operates will change.

Assad has been struggling to clear these very neighborhoods in Damascus and drive out the opposition, but his conventional arsenal was not working well enough or fast enough. Only the Syrian regime has the capacity to deliver chemical weapons on a scale to cause the devastation we saw in Damascus. The rockets were fired from territory controlled by the regime. The rockets landed in territory controlled or contested by the opposition. And the intelligence we have gathered reveals senior officials planning the attack and then, afterwards, plotting to cover up the evidence by destroying the area with shelling. Of course, this is not the first time that Assad has used chemical weapons in this conflict; we assess that he has used them on a small-scale multiple times since March. Whereas previous attacks each killed relatively few people, this one murdered well over a thousand in one fell swoop. Assad is lowering his threshold for use while increasing exponentially the lethality of his attacks. Assad's escalating use of chemical weapons threatens the national security of the United States. And the likelihood that, left unchecked, Assad will continue to use these weapons again and again takes the Syrian conflict to an entirely new level-by terrorizing civilians, creating even greater refugee flows, and raising the risk that deadly chemicals would spill across borders into neighboring Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq. Obviously, the use of chemical weapons also directly threatens our closest ally in the region, Israel, where people once again have readied gas masks. Every time chemical weapons are moved, unloaded, and used on the battlefield, it raises the likelihood that these weapons will fall into the hands of terrorists active in Syria, including Assad's ally Hezbollah and al Qaeda affiliates. That prospect puts Americans at risk of chemical attacks targeted at our soldiers and diplomats in the region and even potentially our citizens at home. Equally, every attack serves to unravel the long-established commitment of nations to renounce chemical weapons use. 189 countries, representing 98 percent of the world's population, are party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the development, acquisition, or use of these weapons. The United States Senate approved that convention by an overwhelming, bipartisan majority, binding America to the global consensus and affirming that we do not tolerate the use or possession of chemical weapons.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksnationalsecurityadvisorsusanericethenewamericafoundation", "title": "Remarks by National Security Advisor Susan E.

Those are the kinds of areas where I would like to see us make a lot of progress this year. We talk about North Korea being this bad actor around The Interview.

This is more like basketball than football, in the sense that there is no clear line between offense and defense. We have great capabilities here. But there are other countries that have great capabilities, as well. Eventually, what we are going to need to do is to find some international protocols that, in the same way we did with nuclear arms, set some clear limits and guidelines, understanding that everybody's vulnerable and everybody's better off if we abide by certain behaviors. In the meantime, we have to have sufficient capability to defend ourselves. Well, I will not lie to you, this is a debate that we have internally. Because when you develop sufficient defenses, the same sophistication you need for defenses means that potentially you can engage in offense. Now, there are some things that we are very clear about. For example, we just do not do industrial espionage the way many other countries do, where their state-sponsored operations are going in and stealing information commercially. Most of the work that we do revolves around threats against us from non-state actors, and obviously terrorism is a huge field.

Well, I vetoed the one in 1974 and again vetoed the one in 1975.1 But in each case I recommended through the Secretary of the Interior the kind of a strip mining bill that I would sign, one that would have a good balance between the protection of the environment on the one hand and the capability of utilizing our vast coal reserves on the other. Unfortunately, the Congress in neither case approved the amendments that I recommended which, in my judgment, would have produced a balanced bill. We are still willing to sit down with the Senate and the House and try to work out a compromise. One of the problems with both of the bills I vetoed was that it would have severely restricted the mining of coal, and coal is our best immediate alternative to foreign oil. We are now mining roughly 600 million tons a year and we want to go to, I think it is, the 1,200 million tons in 10 years. The legislation that I vetoed would have, as a matter of fact, cut back our production, not permitted us to accelerate. In addition, it would have probably meant the loss of, oh, as I recall, about 125,000 jobs, and jobs are important.

They were practically incorporated in the general program by our delegation. These ideas have now been more fully discussed and developed during the visit of Mr. Norman Davis in consultation with the Secretary of State and our ENTITY and Navy advisers, with a view of enlarging their scope and application. With the months that passed, the economic burden and menace to world peace have, if anything, increased. The world needs the reduction of governmental expenditure and the spirit of peace that can come from some degree of successful issue of the Disarmament Conference at Geneva. I have, therefore, asked the Secretary of State to go to Geneva in order to explore with our delegates and those of other nations the possibility of taking some more definite and positive steps in that direction. It is the American desire to produce some concrete and definite results, even though they may not be revolutionary. That is the sole purpose of the Secretary's visit, and there will be no discussion or negotiations by the Secretary on debts. What I asked for in my message yesterday was organized, nonpartisan cooperation of all forces to reduce governmental expenses in a national emergency which insistently demands relief for the taxpayer. There are three general directions in which expenses can be reduced. A definite program to this end was placed before the Congress in the executive budget proposals, in which there was a reduction of $369 million for the forthcoming year. I welcome and hope for further cuts by the Congress, provided that such reductions do not destroy essential functions and that they are genuine and do not merely represent postponed appropriations until deficiency bills next December. There are a large number of expenditures within the bureaus and departments which cannot be reduced without a change in the laws so that the Executive or the Appropriations Committees can reduce such expenditures. In this direction the department heads have appeared before many different committees in Congress in the last months, and have pointed out a multitude of directions which could be considered by these committees for a reduction of expenditures.

If you were a veteran of the first Gulf War and you felt that you were a victim of problems associated with exposure in that war, and if you were a veteran of Iraq or Afghanistan and you experience Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, again, your claim would clear a hurdle automatically under this process that we established in this administration because we believe our veterans deserve it. That immediately increased the population of people who had disability claims added to the backlog, and that backlog has been a focus of intense work and attention by the VA and the administration in general. On the matter of the absolute requirement that our veterans get the health care and services that they deserve and they get that in a timely fashion, the revelations or at least the allegations that have emerged from the situation in Phoenix I think have been greeted, in terms of reaction in the manner that Secretary Shinseki suggested yesterday, with a great deal of anger and frustration. But these are matters -- and other issues that have been discussed in the wake of those allegations -- that are properly under review at the order of Secretary Shinseki, under investigation at the recommendation of Secretary Shinseki by the independent inspector general.

What are the main difficulties facing you and President Gorbachev as you sit down at the table next week at the summit? I determined long ago that it was important that this summit meeting go forward and be successful, and yet I would be misleading you if I did not say that the inability to get dialog going there between the Lithuanians and the Soviets does cause a lot of concern to a lot of us here in the United States. Secondly, I'd like to think we can move the conventional force talks further along than they are now. I think in START we are in reasonable shape, although it will not be ready for a treaty signing. On the chemical weapons side, I think there could well be good news for the free world and everybody in the world if they share my concern about reduction and eventual elimination of chemical weapons. The European questions are not solved by a long shot. How, for example, does post-German unification Europe look? Who will be calling the shots? What is the role for the United States in terms of stability? So, all of these questions will be on the table, and I look forward to a very frank and full discussion. One thing I have found is Mr. Gorbachev will lay it on the table, and I think I owe it to him to let him know how we in the alliance feel and how we in the United States feel on our bilateral. ENTITY taking those one at a time, Lithuania and the other Baltic States are struggling for the kind of freedom and independence that is right at the heart of the American ideal. Are you in any sense embarrassed that your pursuit of arms control success is in fact preventing you from saying what you would like to say about Lithuania? I do not think it is preventing me, because what I say about Lithuania is, Lithuania is entitled to self-determination, to determine their own future. You see, our country has never recognized the incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. But where it could be a problem is some say because we feel that way and we do passionately and because talks are not going forward between the Lithuanians and the Soviets, therefore you ought to not have this meeting or set this summit meeting back.

The rate of increase in employment-not unemployment, in employment-doubled. The percentage of the gross national product or, I mean, the gross national product increased sizably, and the government's revenues increased at the lower rate of taxation. Now, one of the economists who has previously, and all these past months, been opposed to our proposal, Walter Heller, a very distinguished economist, when the recession was announced a short time ago, Walter Heller said how lucky we were that our tax reduction was just going into effect and that that just turned out to be exactly the right medicine for a recession. Well, if it is the right medicine to maybe help cure the recession, why would not it have been good medicine to have prevented the recession?

I expressed to him my admiration of the relentless efforts he exerted for years to make the world more safe and secure for future generations. His recent achievement in this area will certainly have a lasting effect on world peace and stability. I have no doubt that other steps will follow in the same direction during the months ahead. I am certain that regional conflicts will figure high on the agenda throughout the year. Of these conflicts, the Middle East problems deserve special attention and priority. Strenuous efforts are needed to stop the war, which is still raging in the Gulf, and set the peace process in motion again. We have to demonstrate to all the parts concerned that peace is the only meaningful and effective way to settle disputes and solve problems. With this in mind, Egypt has not hesitated at any point to take pioneering steps in order to make peace. It is for this reason, too, that I have proposed a few days ago a moratorium on all forms of violence and repression.

I, therefore, earnestly recommend that the necessity of an increase in the number of judges be supplied by legislation providing for the appointment of additional judges in all federal courts, without exception, where there are incumbent judges of retirement age who do not choose to retire or to resign. If an elder judge is not in fact incapacitated, only good can come from the presence of an additional judge in the crowded state of the dockets; if the capacity of an elder judge is in fact impaired, the appointment of an additional judge is indispensable. I also recommend that the Congress provide machinery for taking care of sudden or long-standing congestion in the lower courts. The Supreme Court should be given power to appoint an administrative assistant who may be called a Proctor. He would be charged with the duty of watching the calendars and the business of all the courts in the federal system. The Chief Justice thereupon should be authorized to make a temporary assignment of any circuit or district judge hereafter appointed This would not apply to the members of the bench at the present time, only the new ones in order that he may serve as long as needed in any circuit or district where the courts are in arrears. I attach a carefully considered draft of a proposed bill, which, if enacted, would, I am confident, afford substantial relief. The proposed measure also contains a limit on the total number of judges who might thus be appointed and also a limit on the potential size of any one of our federal courts. That bill, I might add, as I explained to the Chairmen of the Judiciary Committees of the House and Senate just now, is merely something for them to work on, as in any other case when any bill goes in. It is simply something for them to work on to save them trouble of trying to put the language together. These proposals do not raise any issue of constitutional law. Some of you may, perhaps, realize why I said what I did in my annual message of January sixth. They do not suggest any form of compulsory retirement for incumbent judges.

Much of what is concerned in that linkage, some of the very subjects you talked about, are not things that you headline in the paper. The fact that you do not proclaim such subjects or put them up there in the newspaper does not mean that they cannot be brought up when you are sitting at a table. I think sometimes that politically to publicly discuss things of that kind makes it politically impossible to get them, where maybe in what I have called quiet diplomacy you secure them.

We have tried ever since World War II to simply persuade the Soviets. There have been our own efforts at arms reduction-I think there have been 19 such efforts since World War II-but in other things we have simply tried to persuade. It seems to me that now, with the Soviets having the economic problems I mentioned, that this is an opportunity for us to suggest to them that there might be a better path than they have been taking. And if so, we'd like to explore that better path. Do not you think the pipeline deal is a good idea to suggest to them, that this could be done, as a deal? Our thought about the pipeline was that it was being given without the quid pro quo of some change in attitude and that there was a danger to Europe in making itself too dependent on the Soviet Union as an energy source.

Our people are bound by shared security, by democracy, and by our deep economic ties. There are those who doubt the future of this relationship.

We in the United States are confident about our capacity for partnership. Our areas of common interest are too important. We enjoy a strong security bond with Japan.

We are also giving nonwage-earning spouses equal access to IRA's, those tax deductible savings accounts. But alongside the pension reform passed in the last Congress, this will go a long way toward alleviating poverty by allowing women the means to care for themselves in retirement years. Another report may be of special interest to you as State legislators. Our proposal to eliminate the State and local tax deduction has been getting a lot of flack from some quarters.

Look, I think Valerie remembers us sitting around our kitchen table-a group of friends of mine, some political advisers, Michelle-and I think our basic assessment was maybe we had a 20, 25 percent chance of winning. Because I did think given the problems President Bush had had, that whoever won the Democratic nomination would win the presidency. And so the issue really was, could I get the nomination, particularly with a formidable candidate like Hillary Clinton already preparing to run? And my view was not that this was a sure thing, but what I never doubted was my ability to get white support. You never doubted that? And I think that in addition to the proof of my Senate race, if you want to go a little deeper, there is no doubt that as a mixed child, as the child of an African and a white woman, who was very close to white grandparents who came from Kansas, that I think the working assumption of discrimination, the working assumption that white people would not treat me right or give me an opportunity, or judge me on the basis of merit-that kind of working assumption is less embedded in my psyche than it is, say, with Michelle. I had as a child seen at least a small cross section of white people, but the people who were closest to me loved me more than anything. And so even as an adult, even by the time I am 40, 45, 50, that set of memories meant that if I walked into a room and it is a bunch of white farmers, trade unionists, middle age-I am not walking in thinking, Man, I have got to show them that I am normal . like, these people look just like my grandparents. And I see the same the same Jell-O mold that my grandmother served, and they have got the same, you know, little stuff on their mantelpieces. And so I am maybe disarming them by just assuming that we are okay. And if anything, my concern had more to do with I am really young. I mean, when I look back at the pictures of me running in '08, I look like a kid. And so my insecurities going into the race had more to do with the fact I had only been in the Senate two years.

And whatever way they may want to frame it, the opponents in the Congress of ours, who have opposed our trying to continue helping those people, they really are voting to have a totalitarian Marxist-Leninist government here in the Americas, and there is no way for them to disguise it. As for the budget, we have just started that fight, and I am determined that we are going to carry through with a plan that puts us back on a course that ends deficit spending. ENTITY, let me change the subject. You have indicated your intention beginning a new round of trade talks. Given that some European countries may need some encouragement or some incentives to start talking early 1986, what would you do at the summit to try to encourage them? Well, I think that this is one of the subjects-it always has been-at the summits that we talk about, is the opposing of the forces in each of our countries who want increased protectionism in trade. Protectionism has never been successful, and it usually ends up creating great economic problems for everyone. We have had some fine bilateral discussions with your own Prime Minister, Prime Minister Nakasone. We have made great progress there in ridding ourselves of obstructions to back-and-forth trade, and so with our allies. We are all somewhat guilty, even though we profess we want free trade, and we all really know down in our hearts that it is the best way to go, there still are elements of protectionism that all of us practice. So, what we feel is, it is time to have another round of discussions to see how we can further liberalize and open up our markets to each other. But in connection with that kind of trade talk, I think most Europeans will probably want to gang up on the Japanese, on that other so-called Japan program. How would you do it? Well, we will try to see that no one gangs up on anyone else because, as I said, everyone is guilty.

Well you are right, and it is surprising to me. For instance, NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever. It is just one of the worst. Although TPP, which I terminated before it got signed -- before it got finished, someday hopefully people will be thanking. That would have been one of the great disasters of all times, in terms of trade. And a lot of people understand that, but a lot of people do not . But I was very honored to have just terminated that. And we will do bilateral deals with all those countries. We will do it great. And if they do not do -- treat us properly, we will do a termination or we will do whatever we want to do. These deals, once you get into them -- How likely is it that there will be a resolution on NAFTA in these current negotiations? So I would say this. In order to have a resolution -- because right now, Mexico and Canada have such a great deal -- it is so good that it is very hard for them to get used to the fact that it cannot be that way anymore. And as you know, Mexico has an election coming up and they have a number of people that are running and they are very pro Mexico. Which is -- in fact, they wore a hat -- a green hat that says, Make Mexico Great Again. They call them -- they call them the Donald Trump of politics. They have a couple of them, actually. I said, you -- you negotiate -- I tell my people. And in my opinion, in order to make a fair deal with NAFTA, you have to terminate the deal and you have to see where you are going to come. But I think you have to give them -- to make a fair deal and a great deal, and you see what is going on, we are being very tough and we are being very fair.

As we discussed during our meeting here and our delegations, the relationship between the United States and the Philippines dates back many years. It is a friendship that is forged not only in treaties and trade relationships and military relationships, but it is also strengthened by very personal ties that exist between our two countries. We are proud to have 4 million persons of Filipino ancestry contributing to our country each and every day, in all walks of life. The fact that we have Filipino veterans who have fought side by side with American soldiers on behalf of freedom, all those things have strengthened the relationship between our two countries. I am very pleased that President Arroyo has made such good progress on dealing with counterterrorism issues. She has initiated a peace process in Mindanao that we think is-has the potential to bring peace and stability to a part of the Philippines that has been wracked by unrest for too long. We are very grateful of the strong voice that the Philippines has provided in dealing with issues in Asia, ranging from the human rights violations that have for too long existed in Burma, to the problems that we are seeing with respect to nuclear proliferation in North Korea. I am looking forward to my travels to Southeast Asia, and the Philippines will be the coordinating country in the U.S. relationship with ASEAN, the primary organization-strategic organization for Southeast Asian countries. And in addition, the Philippines will be chairing the nonproliferation treaty conference that will be taking next-place next year. And so we are going to have a busy agenda together working to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons, improving the multilateral partnerships in Asia that can create greater security and greater prosperity for all countries. And in addition, we continue to be grateful for the outstanding contributions that the Philippines has made with respect to U.N. peacekeeping around the world. So although the Philippines is not the largest of countries, it, in using a phrase from boxing, punches above its weight in the international arena, and we are very grateful that President Arroyo has visited us here today. And we are looking forward to using this meeting as a way of launching even greater cooperation between our two countries in the years to come.

After three meetings and many talks one-to-one, how would you characterize , and what do you regard as his main qualities? We can get into discussions where perhaps we are disagreeing quite firmly, and yet there is no personal animus in that with him. I think he solidly represents his country. I have suspected sometimes that he, having been raised in that particular country from childhood, believes some of their propaganda about us. But as I say, we can debate and discuss, and I think he is very sincere about the progressive ideas that he is introducing there and the changes that he thinks should be made. When it is over, I think that there is actually a degree of friendship between us. According to the State Department, we are moving toward an agreement that would allow American psychiatrists to visit Soviet mental hospitals to determine if dissidents are being imprisoned there. The Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights was quoted as saying that there seems to be a genuine interest in the idea of such a visit and in bringing the problem of abuse of psychiatry to an end. Do you think that a formal agreement could be ironed out during your visit to Moscow? I think that some of these things with regard to human rights is not just trying to interfere with their internal affairs at all. But in view of the fact that our country is made up of people from all over the world-and I have used the term myself previously in discussing with them that when a man takes a wife, he does not stop loving his mother-and you perhaps are aware that Americans all retain a feeling of their heritage, even those whose grandparents or great-grandparents first came to this country. I think when Americans get acquainted with each other the first thing they inquire is, you know, what is your background. And as time has gone on, most of us have to name three or four countries in our heritage if our ancestors came a few generations back. And the result of that is that in becoming closer and developing a relationship between the two countries we are affected by public opinion and by people in our country who resent if they think that in the land of their heritage people are being treated unfairly.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwitheuropeanjournalists1", "title": "Interview With European Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-european-journalists-1", "publication_date": "24-05-1988", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And maybe the media has something to do with that, because I think if representatives of those groups that you have just mentioned and others who are listed in the polls as not favoring me-if they understood my views and understood what it is we are actually trying to do. I'd never heard the word, but as Governor of California, one of the first things I did was correct a problem, and before I left as Governor, the environmental movement was underway nationwide-and from the Federal level under an administration that was not necessarily supportive of me. People came to California and said that we were out ahead of the Nation. We took the Federal Government to court in order to have automobile standards in the State of California with regard to the smog problem. So, are you saying that you are perhaps misunderstood by some of these groups that feel alienated? Yes, you mentioned-what Were some of the other groups? Blacks-just having been to that wonderful boys' club this afternoon, let me touch on that one-and misunderstanding. I was raised in a household in which there was no tolerance whatsoever for prejudice or bigotry. And as a sports announcer in radio broadcasting major league baseball, how many young people today remember that when I was broadcasting baseball, no blacks were allowed in organized baseball. There were no Willie Mayses for me to talk about or Hank Aarons-anyone of that kind. And there were a number of us in the sports field then who editorialized and used the pulpit that had been given to us by virtue our job, to campaign against that. And baseball is better for it and the Nation is better for it. But then when I became Governor-I was the 33d Governor of California-I found out that the civil service tests were rigged to prevent blacks from getting any but the lowest possible jobs in State government. I changed that. More than that, up and above civil service, I appointed to policy-making and executive positions more blacks than all the previous 32 Governors of California before me put together.

And while we are talking peace, there are some who seem to suggest that if you are talking military strength, you are talking against peace.

What we need is to be able to deter others who are destabilizing the forces, such as from the Soviet Union with their attempts at expansionism.

Yes, those restrictions which I mentioned a moment ago. We must find where, fairly, we can reconcile the differences between our currencies.

Now, you all know there are a lot of troubles out there. Some of it is just pure growing pains, and nobody has good times all the time. Some of it is just the cycle of things. But a lot of it is the direct result of the fact that in addition to global trade and global investment, the global flow of money has grown so rapidly and in such sweeping volumes. Now over one trillion dollars a day crosses national borders over a trillion dollars a day a lot of it in highly leveraged instruments where people only put up a small percentage of what it is they are investing. A vast amount of funds cross national borders every day just betting for and against national currencies. If you want to have high volumes of investment, if you want to have high volumes of trade, if you want to have high volumes of travel, if you want all that, you have got to have some way of moving money around. But the system that has we have modified over the last 50 years is not adequate to keep the global economy growing and going without running the risk of the kind of boom/bust cycles that used to afflict countries before the Great Depression. After the Great Depression, the United States, Europe, Japan, every country figured out how to avoid it ever happening again. We have not had another Great Depression, have we? We had some stiff recessions. We had some bad times. What we have to do is to devise a system for the global financial movement that will get the benefit of this money moving around without the risk of total collapse that you see affecting some of the countries in Asia and elsewhere. I think it is inconceivable we will be able to do all that without having somebody help in Congress. I tried to get the Congress this year to raise the minimum wage. Because the minimum wage is 5 bucks and 15 cents an hour, and you cannot raise a family on it.

Several years ago the Eastman Company loaned me an executive when I was Governor of Arkansas, and we established the first statewide total quality management program in the country.

I say that because the Federal employees have done a very good job of increasing their output and the quality of their service while downsizing their numbers so that we can take advantage of technology, get the deficit down, get the economy going again. So we have learned from you. And I have talked with Earnie many times about the importance of trying to apply these lessons to other areas of human endeavor. I also think there are applications-if you look at the success in many law enforcement departments around the country, there are law enforcement applications here because the thing that a belief in continuous progress through not only doing the right things but doing the right things right gives you is the conviction that you can repeat whatever you are doing right in one place somewhere else. So I really am delighted to see you here.

And I can say without hesitation or qualification, I am very, very proud to be an American, and I am proud of America. In the last 19 months, as we scan that period of time, really great progress has been made in a number of areas under the most difficult circumstances. Today, America is at peace. Today, there are no Americans committed in combat anyplace throughout the world, and I can assure you that I intend to keep it that way. The best way I know to maintain that is to have what I call peace through strength. And let me say firmly and strongly America's defenses are second to none, and they will continue to be second to none in the next 4 years. In addition to our military strength, America's economic strength is being steadily restored after the worst recession in 40 years. It is easy to get lost in a sea of statistics when we talk about economics. A simple way to look at it is to recall that 19 months ago, everything that was supposed to be going up was going down and vice versa. However, today we are headed in the right direction in every possible economic indicator. Thanks to some commonsense policies and the support of people in the Congress like Jim, at the beginning of this recess, and thanks to the determination and courage and ingenuity of the American people, we are working our way out of this recession, and doing it in the right way. We are on the road to a new prosperity in the United States, and I am not about to take any detours or roadblocks put in the way by a Congress that wants to fool around with our economy in a political and a partisan way. Unemployment is going down, prices are stabilizing, inflation has been cut in half in the last 19 months. In fact, the Labor Department announced just yesterday that consumer prices increased only one-tenth of 1 percent in the month of February, the smallest monthly increase in over 4 years, and that is progress by any standard. On an annual basis, that represents an inflation rate of a little more than 1 percent per year, and that is a whole lot better than the 12 percent that we were experiencing in 1973 and 1974.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkscharlottereceptionhonoringrepresentativejamesgmartinnorthcarolina", "title": "Remarks in Charlotte at a Reception Honoring Representative James G.

So, in short, the international community has made it harder than ever for terrorists to acquire nuclear weapons, and that has made us all safer. We are building an international architecture that can ensure nuclear safety. But we are under no illusions. We know that nuclear material, enough for many weapons, is still being stored without adequate protection. And we know that terrorists and criminal gangs are still trying to get their hands on it as well as radioactive material for a dirty bomb. We know that just the smallest amount of plutonium--about the size of an apple--could kill hundreds of thousands and spark a global crisis. The danger of nuclear terrorism remains one of the greatest threats to global security. And that is why here in Seoul, we need to keep at it. We are expecting dozens of nations to announce over the next several days that they have fulfilled the promises they made 2 years ago. And we are now expecting more commitments--tangible, concrete action--to secure nuclear materials and, in some cases, remove them completely. This is the serious, sustained global effort that we need, and it is an example of more nations bearing the responsibility and the costs of meeting global challenges. This is how the international community should work in the 21st century. And Korea is one of the key leaders in this process. securing our own material and helping others protect theirs. We are moving forward with Russia to eliminate enough plutonium for about 17,000 nuclear weapons and turn it instead into electricity.

By '96, the issue was working for us, because I could go to places like New Hampshire and say, I want everybody that missed a day in the deer woods to vote against me.

But in '94 my party's Members bore the brunt of that. Then the third problem we had, and this is where I think you were right, is I was trying so hard to keep all of my campaign commitments and the way I made them I should have done welfare reform before health care. You were right about that. I do not know that I took that position. I thought you were saying that.   I will tell you where I was wrong, is that when it came to doing welfare reform, I chickened out, and I wrote a column the week you signed it telling you not to sign it. I talked to Elwood last week, and he is turned around on it as well. But the reason is, I think, if you go back, there is one thing that nobody in the press has picked up and we ought to talk about this later is why I vetoed the first two bills and signed the third one.

So in '93, they did a big economic plan and NAFTA, and in '94 they did this big crime bill. And they might have been able to do welfare reform, but there is no way the system could digest the health care thing.

Looking ahead, do you think it is important for the American people to sort of view China mostly as a strategic competitor or more as a partner? I would call it a-I would-I think as we look ahead I would view it as a management of a complex relationship, where sometimes our national interests are aligned and sometimes our national interests are not aligned. They could-and let me just talk about the economy, for example. And one reason I call it a complex relationship is that here in America, trade with China is not necessarily universally accepted as good. It is universally accepted as good in this administration. I mean, free and fair trade is good for the world, and I believe it is good for this relationship. But it is a-some in America view the advent of Chinese manufacturing, particularly at the lower end of the economic scale, as direct competition with their own livelihood, thereby making the relationship complex. Energy-what is very interesting is that if you view China as a market, you want them to become more robust and more prosperous. But in order to do that, China is going to have to have more energy, and as China demands more energy, it creates more global demand relative to a slower growing supply, means higher prices for us all. It is a very interesting and important relationship made complex by globalization, and their constantly changing internal situation, particularly when it comes their economy. I am sure you have been reading about the Doha discussions. On the one hand, we have got very good relations. On the other hand, it was hard to find common ground to get the Doha deal closed. So it is hard to label the relationship one way or the other. An American President is going to have to pay very close attention to relations with not only China, but the region. And I say the region because if it ever-if the perception is ever that the United States is fixated only on China, then you are going to have issues with long-time allies, people that have been counting on the American support for a period of time. And so never can the foreign policy be viewed as zero sum.

We have 62 1/2 million people at work. Businessmen, farmers, laborers, white-collar people, all have better incomes and more of the good things of life than ever before in the history of the world. No depositor has lost a cent in that period. And the income of our people has been fairly distributed, perhaps more so than at any other time in recent history.

A nation in which half of our youth is ignorant of geography, in which drugs are rampant, in which a substantial proportion of the population knows little hope such a nation will not long remain competitive. And in the final analysis, improving our schools, driving out drugs, and bringing hope and opportunity to those who need it most these are issues of our national well-being, even our national security. Working together, we can raise the level of learning in the classrooms of America. On April 5th, I sent a package to the Congress, an educational reform package based on four principles rooted in the practical experience of the States. To have reform, excellence and achievement must be recognized and rewarded; to have reform, Federal dollars should be targeted to those most in need; to have reform, we need flexibility and choice choice for parents, choice for schools in their selection of teachers and principals. And finally, the essence of reform is accountability in education and reward for those schools that show progress. If implemented, I believe that these measures will restore the quality of American education and redeem the future of millions of children, but there is more to be done. On June 5th, I asked the business community to study what the private sector can do to energize and support educational reform.

We have been long hours around that Cabinet table on the budget matter and, finally, have now submitted it. We have not yet begun that process on the tax program.

But I think that Dr. Franklin and the race commission concluded that it might be a diversion from our present task, which is to look at the problems we have today and to figure out how to overcome them, and to recognize, too, that the race issue in America is today and going forward even more complicated because it is not just about black and white Americans; it is about Hispanic-Americans; it is about Asian-Americans; it is about people from South Asia, people from the Middle East.

It is creating jobs in South Korea, and not just with SK, but anyway with Samsung and other industries. With regard to your question, let me provide my answer. Korea and the U.S., based on its Washington Declaration, our two countries have agreed to strengthen extended deterrence, and the implementation level is different from the past.

And I ask all of you, based on your personal experience here and without regard to any political differences you may otherwise have, to please, please help me convince the Congress that it is the right thing for America's children to have the smaller classes, to have more teachers, and to have modern schools. Every single child in America deserves them, and the United States ought to be in the forefront of helping achieve that. And I thank you for that. Let me also say to all of you, I learned when I came here today, because I received a little card from one of the students, that next week is the week you have student elections at the school here. And what I'd like to say is, I hope that all the parents will be just as good citizens as the students are. Because Tuesday is election day in America, as well. For nearly 6 years, I have worked hard to bring our country together across all the lines that divide us, so that America would work the way this school works, so that we could all feel the way I think all of you feel today, coming from your different walks of life to this common ground. America ought to be a place of common ground, where we move forward together. I am grateful for the fact that after 6 years we have nearly 17 million new jobs and the lowest unemployment in 28 years; the highest homeownership in history, over two-thirds of Americans in their own homes for the first time ever; the smallest percentage of our people on public assistance, welfare, in 29 years; lowest crime rate in 25 years. I am proud of that. I am also determined that we take this moment of prosperity, which has given us the first balanced budget since 1969 and a surplus, to meet the long-term challenges of America. We talked about education today. Those of you who come from the rest of the world and have come here as immigrants, who have relatives in other countries, know that there is a lot of financial turmoil in the rest of the world.

And if it is revenue neutral, it will end up actually providing more revenues from the simple reason that you will broaden the base of the economy. Let me try one more tax question, sir. You also spoke favorably about the notion of lowering rates and, as you just said, broadening the base by eliminating many exemptions. But right after you did that, you then called for two new exemptions; namely, enterprise zones and tuition tax credits. Does not that just encourage others to try to carve out their own special places for their own pet write-offs and threaten to unravel that whole concept of lowering the base by broadening-or lowering the rates by broadening the base? Well, if you are trying to make a tax program more fair, which is also part of this proposal-take the issue you have raised of tuition tax credits. Here you have, I think, a very broad-based on fairness in the country-you have got people who are compelled to send their children to school under the law, because we believe that a democracy can only exist if you have a literate citizenry. And yet these people who, if they choose or feel they can get a better education for their children, choose a private or parochial school, independent school of some kind, they pay the full cost of sending their child to that school. But at the same time, they are paying the full cost that parents of children are paying-they are paying that in taxes to support the public school system. Now, if you stop and think what the additional cost to public schools would be if suddenly the independent schools closed and all those students were turned over to the educational market-and it would not mean an increase in revenues for public education, because already they are getting the money from those parents-you could see what a burden this would be. Well, it seems to me that it is only fair that some parent-as a matter of fact, the ultimate fairness would be educational vouchers. Does government properly support a school system, or does it provide the funds directly to the students to get an education? They could take that voucher and go where they want, and you put competition back into education.

The leaders of Britain and France and Russia honestly did not believe that lifting the embargo would make things better, would hasten the day of peace. We had an honest disagreement. The German Government agreed with the position I took. But it was an honest disagreement within the most complicated foreign policy problem that any of us have faced in years. I do not seek to place blame anywhere. When my position did not prevail and when I did not have the power to implement it unilaterally because of the U.N. embargo on arms- all I could do is do what we did last week. I voted with many of the nonaligned nations in the United Nations, and we did not win the battle. But then I went back when you talk about changing my position, what I did was I went back to the British, the French, and the others and I said, Okay, what can we agree on? We do not want to say, 'Well, we did not get our way; so we are going to go home.' We will work with you. What can we agree on? They proposed a course that we then embarked on, and they agreed not to totally rule out lifting the arms embargo at a later date. So I, frankly, was pleased to try to work with and to support the efforts of Europe in this regard. I did not point the finger or blame. But we cannot deny the fact that there was an honest disagreement. So may I, as a follow-up, press you on this? You see, as you say, you voted at the United Nations with Djibouti and Morocco and Pakistan and the Cape Verde Islands on this issue about the arms embargo against Britain and France.

I will also say to the world that the Baltic countries know what it means to live under fear and the lack of freedom, and to have these countries be allied with the United States and other nations is important to our soul. It is important to have that sense of freedom as a source of vigor and strength, and a very important alliance. That is what I want to say. What are America and Lithuania going to do after the Prague, together? Well, we are going to work to fight terror. It is most evident here in America because we have been under attack, and we are still under attack. People still want to hurt us because of what we stand for. But countries which love freedom are not immune from these people. These are coldblooded killers, and we have got a charge to keep for a long time coming. And the best way to do that is work together. So the NATO mission is one of defending freedom by fighting against those who would try to defeat freedom, which means we have got to share intelligence, work together militarily in a way that complements everybody, cut off the money of the terrorists. But that is the true threat that we face. After Prague, I am going to Russia. And I am going to say to the Russian people, You should not fear expansion of NATO to your border. These are freedom-loving people that are now on your border. You ought to welcome them. It should help Russian security - that the cold war is over, that the United States does not view Russia as a threat and neither does NATO. So we have got to address our sights to the new threats.

Well, it has great superficial appeal, but the truth is that anybody who wants to go to Mexico and invest their money for low wages can do so today. But the market opening measures that have been taken by President Salinas in the last few years have led the United States from a $5 billion trade deficit to a $6 billion trade surplus with Mexico. And we are in effect because Canada, as you know, is our biggest trade partner-we are now building this hemispheric economic bloc that we want. And so I think we can refute it on the merits. The third thing we have to do is ask the economists to consider what will happen if we do not pass the trade agreement. Our relationships with Canada are secure, and we have a bilateral agreement, and that is fine. But we could go back in our relationships with Mexico, which would mean economic problems for Mexico, more trade barriers, fewer jobs in America, more illegal immigration. A lot of problems could develop for the United States if we do not do the NAFTA. However, I believe that our goal ought to be to find ways to make preserving the environment good economics. At the Rio conference last year, Japan, Germany, and many other European countries were proving that you could do that because they were down there promoting environmental technology while the United States was trying to stop the environmental agreements. I think that our country was not as wise as many of the nations here represented in the way they approached the Rio conference. We have now signed on, the United States has, to the Biodiversity Treaty. And we have basically adopted a policy of long-term environmental preservation with an aggressive effort to figure out how to make jobs and incomes and prosperity flow out of that. And I believe that there are lots of opportunities to do that. If I might just mention one, our bilateral aid package to Russia that is now making its way to the Congress focuses heavily on what we can do with our technology to help them to reduce the problems that their nuclear industry-and not simply their bombs but their nuclear power plants, for example-present to them, and what else we can do in the area of energy and the environment to help to clean up their environment in ways that are good for their economy and good for ours.

I also want to recognize your university president, Susan Herbst; your athletic director, Warde Manuel; and Larry McHugh, the chairman of your board of trustees.

I can make that joke now that I have got gray hair. Only once before, in 2004, has one school won both the men's and women's Division I titles. And of course, that was who? This is the women's ninth national title, more than any other women's basketball team in history. For the men, it is their fourth title in the last 16 years, which is twice as many as anybody else during that same span of time. Which makes me think, what is up with you guys? It is just a remarkable thing what these two programs have accomplished. Of course, this season the women went a perfect 40-0, won their games by an average of 34 points, so there was not a lot of suspense during their season. In a championship game billed as one of the biggest in women's basketball history, the Huskies routed the previously unbeaten Notre Dame and gave me bragging rights. It gave me bragging rights to pick them in my bracket. I mean, me and 95 percent of the country. And this marked the fifth time that UConn has finished a season as an undefeated national champion. Of course, a lot of this success belongs to Coach Geno, who has cemented his place as not only a legend in women's basketball, but one of the best coaches that we have ever seen at any level and any sport, period.

They will decide whether it is a Congress that wants to represent all the American people and work for one America or a Congress that will continue to try to divide the American people in ways that undermine our ability to unite and to go forward. They will decide on whether they want a Congress that supports a Patients' Bill of Rights, that supports 100,000 teachers and smaller classes and modern schools, or a Congress that opposes those things; a Congress that supports an increase in the minimum wage, or one that opposes it; a Congress that supports protecting our surplus until we have saved Social Security for all the seniors in this country in the 21st century, or one that is still committed to squandering the surplus and endangering our economic strength in the long run so that we cannot do what we should do on Social Security.

Booms and busts were just the way things worked and there was not much we could do about it-sort of like the natural cycles of the moon. Sure, they took down speculators, but they also took out farmers, small business owners, employees and millions of people who got swept away by massive economic forces that they could not control. Unemployment skyrocketed, peaking at more than 20 percent. Across the country, frightening rumors caused Americans to rush to empty their bank accounts, triggering more crises. We can do better. We can use regulation to end the boom-and-bust cycles. And that is exactly what he did. For more than 50 years, those rules stayed in place-and they worked. Regulations bought us economic stability. And the financial services industry served the American people, rather than the other way around. GDP was climbing and America's middle class was getting a huge share of all that growth. We were on a roll. In the 1970s, environmental issues moved front and center, along with the safety of America's families. It may be hard to believe, but back in the '50s and '60s, big American cities were smothered with thick layers of nasty, dirty smog. People sucked down toxic chemicals on the way to work; little kids breathed in dangerous substances on school playgrounds. The factory owners that spewed their filth in the air did not care -- they did not pay the cost of their pollution. The auto manufacturers were not held responsible for the tailpipe emissions from the cars they built. But the millions who suffered asthma attacks, developed lung cancer, and died from heart disease because of dirty air paid a terrible price. During one Thanksgiving week in 1966, a severe smog crisis choked New York City, killing hundreds of people. People demanded action, but giant corporations pushed back hard. Big carmakers said that they would never be able to meet the deadlines to reduce emissions, that it would cost too much to adapt their vehicles, that they would go bankrupt. Congress passed the Clean Air Act, giving the EPA the authority to put in place strong new rules and clear deadlines to protect us. From 1970 to 2016, common air pollutants fell 73 percent.

One, I believe we are in an ideological struggle against people who want to achieve their ideological vision through the use of violence and murder. And I believe it is essential that you have an alternative available for people; the one I happen to believe in is based upon liberty. And I tell people this, that I do believe there is a universal God, and a gift of that Almighty to all of us, whether we be Methodists or Muslims or nothing, is freedom.

And to me the best type of society to do that is freedom. And so you have to plant a seed, and you have to cultivate the seed, and eventually the crops will bloom.

That is the promise of America. That is the promise of America. Now, when we came together, we knew restoring that bargain that deal, that compact was not going to be easy. because we had seen what had happened in the previous decade. The cost of everything from health care to college was going up. And then, it all culminated in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, a crisis that robbed too many of our friends and our neighbors of jobs, the value of their homes, their savings. And all that pushed the American Dream even further out of reach for too many working people. But you know what, we have spent the last 3 1/2 years digging ourselves out of that hole. We averted a depression, created 4.5 million new jobs, 500,000 in manufacturing. We saved an auto industry. We worked to make sure that health care was secure for families. And what we discovered during the course of these difficult times is that a crisis does not change our character. It does not change who we are as a people. our toughness, our grit, our resilience, and our ability to come together and work together on behalf of this country. And when we came together in 2008, we understood that there is a core decency, that there is a goodness to the American people, and we need to make sure that that is reflected in what happens in Washington.

But my question has to do with, assuming that election and assuming it to be of significant proportions, what is your number one priority for a new administration? Well, it has a few parts to it. If there is a new administration-I mean, mine, for me. That is what I meant, too. If there is, I want to continue with what we called a new beginning back when we started this last 4 years-the economic recovery that we have had. And I want to continue on the road that we started in the international scene, which is aimed at peace. Everyone seems to have overlooked in this campaign the fact that when we set out to rebuild our defenses, we said there was a second track of equal importance, and that was to engage the Soviet Union in legitimate talks to reduce weapons, particularly the strategic weapons. And while they have walked away from the table at this time, I cannot believe they are going to stay away. I think its in their own interest to join us at that table again. But the program that we started, which was based on the tax cuts to provide an incentive to get the economy growing again, the reducing of, first, the increase in Federal spending, which was at a rate of about 17 percent and is down around 6 percent now, to continue getting that down. And we have almost 2,500 recommendations by the Grace commission that we have a task force working on-we have implemented some already that we have been able to do administratively; others would require legislation-but to put those in place.

These savings will not reduce the effective military strength we will deliver to ourselves and our allies during fiscal 1954. They are already on the books and in contracts. Deliveries actually will be speeded up through the reduction of lead time, and concentration on producing those items which make the most military sense for the immediate future. Practically everyone concerned with the problem can with some justification be a special pleader. But I am sure that what the overwhelming majority of Americans want to believe is that their Government is working with diligence and intelligence to bring about as rapidly as possible a condition of true military strength. I also believe that the overwhelming majority of the people of the free world appreciate the fact that a healthy American economy and a functioning economy in their own home country are inseparable from true defense. Furthermore, I have a deep conviction that all these people possess a fundamental common sense Which permits them to grasp the difference between a quiet, steady, long-term improvement in their defense position and the tempests stirred up by public arguments over the artificial arithmetic which is so easy to produce in the defense field. The program we are presenting is a long-term program, calling for a steady and adequate flow of men and materials to present a position of genuine strength to any would-be aggressor. The basic elements of our strategic problem have not materially changed in recent years, and certainly not in recent days. The areas and peoples vital to our Nation's welfare are the same as they have been for a long time. What we are doing is to adopt a new policy for the solution of the problem. This change in policy is radical and cannot be effected overnight. There exists what is, in effect, a straitjacket, comprising prior authorizations, appropriations, and contracts. The essence of the change is this. We reject the idea that we must build up to a maximum attainable strength for some specific date theoretically fixed for a specified time in the future. Defense is not a matter of maximum strength for a single date. It is a matter of adequate protection to be projected as far into the future as the actions and apparent purposes of others may compel us. It is a policy that can, if necessary, be lived with over a period of years.

But that meant we had to put off some of the plans or scale them back in the early going and put them back into the later years of my term to invest money in things that I think are also important. But we have got to get control of this deficit. It is been spinning out of control now, getting worse and worse for a dozen years, and we do not have the funds we need to invest in jobs to grow the economy, and I think it is very important. I think William Greider pointed it out in Rolling Stone-and you either agree with it obviously or do not -that during the campaign that the focus was on and the debate was on jobs. And it seemed that because of Bush cooking the books and not realizing that the deficit was going to be a little bit bigger than it was, that then the agenda switched to this 5-year plan to reduce the deficit. Let me ask you- But wait, let me make one point. I think they are two sides of the same thing. That is, if I did not think that reducing the deficit over the long run would help us to create more jobs and if I did not think we could also get some increased investment in new technologies and education and training and to rebuild our cities and to do these things that have to be done I would not be doing this. I think they are two sides of the same coin. I think until we show we can get control over the Government's budget and we can make some spending cuts, as well as restore some of the tax loses that we had in the early years of the trickle-down revolution, I do not think we can get a job program going in the country. So I think this getting the deficit down is part of a long-term job growth strategy. Jobs are the issue; reducing the deficit is a means to get control of our economic future. The whole purpose of it is to put people to work.

We do not know what kind of leadership will be in Iran, and you have said repeatedly that this is not about regime change. But we can expect and here I am paraphrasing a reader of ours, Sam Kermanian, a Persian Jewish leader in L.A. and he wrote to us and he said, look, Iran is going to gain international legitimacy, it is going to have a stronger economy, the arms embargoes are going to be lifted, they will have more access to conventional weapons. You say that the United States retains the right always to use a military option if it looks like Iran is getting a nuclear weapon. But will not it be much more difficult , will not Iran be more formidable to attack 10 or 15 years from now when it is stronger than the way it is been the last few years, so isolated and so weak? Well, keep in mind that under the terms of this agreement, we have great confidence that not only will we have shut off the various pathways to a nuclear weapon, but we will also have installed an unprecedented verification and inspection mechanism that helps us to understand the entire nuclear production chain inside of Iran. IAEA inspectors will be there on a regular basis reporting what will be conducted on a regular basis. And we will, for the first 10 years, have maintained a one-year breakout time so that if they cheat, we will have ample time to catch them and call them to account. And that is a significantly longer breakout time than exists right now, and certainly a longer breakout time than will exist if Congress rejected the deal. Around year 10, 11, 12, that breakout time starts shrinking again and we are back to a situation in which they could theoretically try to dash for a bomb. But under the terms of the agreement, they will still be prohibited from having a nuclear weapon, so they would be violating international law if they dash for a bomb 15 years from now.

They need to think long and hard, these countries that have been a little squeamish about being firm, whether or not it is possible that they could be the victims of this, if not directly from Iraq, from some group or another that Iraq sells to in the future.

And I would like to ask why is it so important to you, ENTITY? First of all, let me speak about my relationship with Prime Minister Sharon, if you do not mind. We have grown close, and one of the reasons why is I appreciate a person who when he says something, means it. And I hope he appreciates that about me. In other words, I said early on, we are going to join in fighting terror so that Israel could be secure and America secure and other free nations secure. Secondly-and I have-and he knows I keep my word, and I know he keeps his word. Secondly, what I appreciate is somebody who thinks boldly for peace. And Ariel Sharon came to the White House and said, We are going to disengage from the Gaza. And the disengagement is, I think, a part of making Israel more secure and peaceful, and I agree with the Prime Minister. It is important because the United States is a strong ally of Israel and, therefore, if you are a strong ally, you want there to be peace for your ally. You know, the main concern of Israel is that the disengagement might lead not to more security but, on the contrary, to more violence. Do you understand the concerns? And I can understand why people think this decision is one that will create a vacuum into which terrorism will flow. I think this will create an opportunity for democracy to emerge, and democracies are peaceful. And therefore, it is very important for the United States, as an active participant in this process, to encourage the formation of security forces that will defeat terror, just like the roadmap calls for-these are Palestinian security forces-and to encourage the Palestinians to develop a peaceful state. You had announced that you will support the disengagement by some aid the administration will provide Israel to develop the northern and southern-the Galilee and the Negev. Has any decision been made regarding this issue? Well, first of all, I did say when the Prime Minister was here that the Negev and Galilee present great opportunities for economic development.

What does this prove, or does it prove anything? The only thing I know is that I have had a report that Austria is holding in jail at least three members of the Abu Nidal group. And this, in itself, could be a reason for them taking an action in an effort to blackmail Austria into releasing its members.

So I hope that my trip here and the longterm rekindling of the relationship with India that I am committed to for our country can basically, slowly, over time, take this in a different direction. You know as well as I do that you are talking, to a very large extent, in generalities. What do you think the United States can really do here, especially given the fact that the Indians say the United States has no role? Well, I think that what they say is that we have no role in Kashmir. And they have every right to say that. Every place in the world I have been involved in the peace process you know, it is because we have been able to inspire the confidence and have a relationship with both parties. But I think the United States does have an interest in trying to avert a larger conflict and trying to reduce the tensions between the two countries. I think we do have a clear interest there. We have worked with the Pakistanis for years. We want it and obviously we have got a big interest in India's future. So therefore, I think anything I can do to get them to focus on what it would take to reduce the tensions is important. And I think right now the important thing is respecting the Line of Control, reducing violence, and find a way to resume the dialog. Now, beyond that, it is up to them. You will tell the Pakistanis they should respect the Line of Control, the de facto cease-fire line?

What goes through your mind when you are in front of these marines here at Camp Lejeune and you have to tell them that they are going into harm's way? in your role as Commander in Chief. And my main goal is to make sure that any time we are deploying our men and women in uniform, that the civilian leadership has done everything that it needs to do to make the best decision possible. And that means consulting with our commanders on the ground; it means talking to every level of Pentagon leadership, from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to my Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates; it means also consulting with a wide range of people outside, so that you are not just listening to one voice, you are listening to a whole bunch of them and then arriving at some sort of consensus. And I am confident that with respect to our drawdown in Iraq, it is done in a way that General Odierno is comfortable with, General Petraeus is comfortable with, that our diplomatic efforts can be ramped up to accompany that drawdown. With respect to Afghanistan, I think that all of us believe that the situation has deteriorated somewhat there, and that is why I immediately made a decision for us to send additional troops, including marines from Camp Lejeune. But I also think that we have got to refine our goals and our strategy more effectively. I think in Afghanistan we have seen that strategy drift a little bit. And, you know, my most important job as Commander in Chief is to make sure that if we are sending folks there, we have a well-thought-out strategy, clear goals, and that they are achievable and that I can marshal and maintain the strongest support possible from folks back home. And to sort of continue with that topic, you said that the U.S. will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat Al Qaida and to combat extremism in the region. What will this mean for our men and women in Afghanistan now and in the future, sir? Well, first of all, by sending an additional 17,000 troops, we are obviously going to be bolstering our forces in Afghanistan, and that will obviously be important to the folks that are already there.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmastersergeantrustybarfieldthepentagonchannel", "title": "Interview With Master Sergeant Rusty Barfield of the Pentagon Channel", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-master-sergeant-rusty-barfield-the-pentagon-channel", "publication_date": "27-02-2009", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

The Governor has been Governor of Illinois, and that is wonderful experience for the Presidency, because he will have the same kind of problems to deal with as the President as he has had to deal with as Governor. They will be on a larger scale, of course. Governor Stevenson has also had wide experience in national and international affairs. During the war he was the right-hand man to the Secretary of the Navy. Then in 1943 President Roosevelt sent him to Italy to study conditions there and recommend the policies we should follow. Stevenson recommended a plan that would put Italy back on her feet and keep her out of the hands of the Communists. That plan he worked out was the forerunner of what later was turned into the Marshall plan that saved the free world in Europe. After the war was over, Governor Stevenson played a very important part in helping set up the United Nations. Twice he represented us at the General Assembly, and he did an outstanding job. I am sure you can see from what I have told you why the Democratic Party is proud of its candidate for President. He is a man of real principle, with the right kind of experience for the job. I wish I could say as much for the Republican candidate. But in all honesty, I cannot . He was a very good general, but unfortunately he has not had the proper experience for political office. He has been in the ENTITY 40 years, and that is a very different type of occupation. Now let me give you an analysis. Suppose, instead of appointing General Eisenhower, who at the time was our most experienced general, to command the forces which were being organized to keep the world free, I had appointed the mayor of my hometown to that job, it would have made just as much sense as for the Republicans to nominate a general to run this country. If you will study our history, you will find that we have never had but two regular professional generals for President, and neither one of them was able to handle the job. Every day the Republican candidate is giving us new proof of why that is true. The General is just no match for professional politicians. He has let the Old Guard Republicans take him into camp, and Senator Taft has become the real commander of the General's campaign.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsrearplatformandotherinformalremarksconnecticutmassachusettsandnewhampshire", "title": "Rear Platform and Other Informal Remarks in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/rear-platform-and-other-informal-remarks-connecticut-massachusetts-and-new-hampshire", "publication_date": "16-10-1952", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S Truman"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Well, I believe Cristiani when he says he wants to get to the bottom of it. He is asked for some technical help, he is gotten some, and it is absolutely essential that we keep insisting that the Cristiani government get to the bottom of those killings. And having said that, I would like to express, lest the question not arise, my concern about the wanton attack by these FMLN guerrillas on the residences of Americans serving in official capacity there in El Salvador. That is unacceptable to us. And what I can do about it, I do not know. So, get to the bottom of those who killed the priests, absolutely, and they owe us and the rest of the world an explanation on that. The killers must be brought to justice. Secondly, the FMLN ought to stop shooting up civilian population and trying to undermine an elected government that is been through certifiably free elections. And I am outraged by the attacks on the lives of Americans -- holding Americans in hotels, attacking Americans' residences. And so, I have outrage on both accounts. If I could go back to Europe for a second It is clear that the changes of this year somehow are going to alter the definition of what NATO and the Warsaw Pact are all about. Do you have some ideas or some thoughts about the longrun future of the alliances and how they ought to change to meet these new circumstances that you want to get across to Mr. Gorbachev? One of the things that is responsive in that area is, we began talking at the last meetings of NATO's role and concern on economic problems and on other global problems. That is not to say that suddenly the mission changes one day from an alliance with strong military component to some economic structure.

In 1921 they got prices down 20 percent in a big hurry and there were 7 million people out of work. In 1931 they got prices down 25 percent in 2 years-and it took 14 million unemployed to do that. Any time you hear their candidate talk about cutting prices, and bringing back that Hoover dollar, you had better stop and think how the Republicans go about those things. In the first effort they made 7 million unemployed. In the next effort they made 14 million unemployed, and if you give them another chance, you will probably have 18 million. You will not get steady prices from an outfit like that boom and bust is their stock in trade. Their record speaks for itself. They will not look out for your jobs, your income, or the prices you have to pay. The Constitution provides that the power of government rests in the people, and when the people exercise their right to vote, they exercise the power that controls the Government.

And the transmission of this disease obviously directly threatens all our populations. In addition, we have not only a humanitarian crisis in West Africa that threatens hundreds of thousands of lives, but we also have the secondary effects of destabilization, economically and politically, that could lead to more severe problems down the road.

I spoke yesterday with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who agrees that everybody has to do more. And I can assure everybody that the United States will continue to do its part.

As I have said before, we have a public health infrastructure and systems and support that make an epidemic here highly unlikely. But obviously, one case is too many, and we have got to keep on doing everything we can, particularly to protect our health care workers, because they are on the front lines in battling this disease. And we have also now instituted some additional screening measures, starting at JFK Airport, that will then apply to a number of other airports where we know the bulk of travelers that may have come in contact with Ebola would be coming through. We are confident that we are going to be able to put those in place in the days ahead.

On almost every issue, it is , Well, Democrats and Republicans cannot agree -as opposed to looking at why is it that they cannot agree. Who exactly is preventing us from agreeing? And I want to be very clear here that Democrats, we have got a lot of warts, and some of the bad habits here in Washington when it comes to lobbyists and money and access really goes to the political system generally. It is not unique to one party. But when it comes to certain positions on issues, when it comes to trying to do what is best for the country, when it comes to really trying to make decisions based on fact as opposed to ideology, when it comes to being willing to compromise, the Democrats, not just here in this White House, but I would say in Congress also, have shown themselves consistently to be willing to do tough things even when it is not convenient, because it is the right thing to do. And we have not seen that same kind of attitude on the other side. Until Republicans feel that there is a real price to pay for them just saying no and being obstructionist, you will probably see at least a number of them arguing that we should keep on doing it. It worked for them in the 2010 election cycle, and I think there are those who believe that it can work again. I disagree with them, and I think the cost to the country has been enormous. But if you look at the most recent fiscal deal, I presented to Speaker Boehner a package that would have called for $1.2 trillion in new revenue-less than I actually think we need, but in the spirit of compromise-and over nine hundred billion dollars in spending cuts, some of which are very difficult.

But in the case of Merrick Garland, we have not seen a substantive argument against his jurisprudence.

Now what is true, ENTITY, is, is that, you know, we have a divided court on a lot of important issues. Justice Scalia was a big figure who was viewed as providing a majority on conservative positions on some of the cases that came before the court. And so I understand the politics that Republican senators are dealing with, and the price they would pay if in fact they confirmed a nominee. If in fact we have gotten to the point where they cannot confirm somebody because a Democratic ENTITY is nominating them, what is to stop them from saying next year, We have got another excuse for not confirming a Democratic ENTITY's nominee ? And at that point the process has broken down. Democrats have not been blameless in this process. You cannot point to me a circumstance in which Democrats have left a seat open when a Republican ENTITY was in office simply because they did not like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court. Justice Kennedy was confirmed by Ronald Reagan, and I am quite certain that there were a whole lot of Democratic senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. And he was confirmed in the last year of ENTITY Reagan's office. So we actually have evidence we have proof, not that Democrats are perfect, but that they do at a certain point recognize that the process and the sanctity of the Supreme Court, and the integrity of the institution, not just the Supreme Court, but the integrity of the Senate, and the office of ENTITY, requires them to do their job. And my simple pitch to them is, be fair not to ignore politics. I am not demanding that Republicans vote for Merrick Garland, but do not stop the process in its tracks because if you do, then the ever-escalating, ever-worsening problems behind not just judicial nominees, but nominations generally, are going to continue to make our government more and more dysfunctional.

And that is a problem, because unfortunately we now have essentially a 60-vote requirement on every single issue, including trying to get judges confirmed who've passed through the Judiciary Committee on a unanimous basis.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithprogressivebloggers", "title": "Interview with Progressive Bloggers", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-progressive-bloggers", "publication_date": "27-10-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Those that were subject to indictment were treated appropriately; the others went right on with their lives. So they handled it in the appropriate way. So this country allows people broader personal freedoms than almost any democracy in the world, particularly with regard to the right to keep and bear arms. And I guess my question is, absent the sort of action that you described, murdering a sheriff-- The FBI needs to be in a position, without abusing people's freedoms, to try to prevent things like Oklahoma City from happening. And should they do that by beginning surveillance of some of the religious groups? We have to be able to gather intelligence from people if we have reason to believe that they are threatening to use violence. The question is, is there reason to believe that these people are likely, that any groups are likely to use violence? And I think what our bill does is to give the FBI the means, in a high-tech world with a lot of high-tech criminals, to use high technology within appropriate safeguards to try to prevent the Oklahoma Cities, to try to prevent these things from happening in the first place. And I guess what I am asking is, from what you know now, would some of these militias currently present an appropriate target for the use of that sort of surveillance? From what I know now, the FBI would have to consider that based on the rhetoric and the conduct and make a judgment based on the facts of each group. I do not want to jump the gun here. I think it is important- what I am asking for is to give us the tools we need to combat terrorism. I know-for example, if you look at Israel, for all the terrible incidents they have endured, well over half of the planned terrorist incidents in Israel never occur because they have the capacity to defang them. We have endured this awful bombing in Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center bombing, which came from a group outside this country that infiltrated here. We also-our Federal authorities have been successful in heading off at least two other incidents of terrorism that we know about that they were able to stop from occurring.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithlauriemontgomerythedetroitfreepressandangiecannonknightridder", "title": "Interview With Laurie Montgomery of the Detroit Free Press and Angie Cannon of Knight-Ridder Newspapers", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-laurie-montgomery-the-detroit-free-press-and-angie-cannon-knight-ridder", "publication_date": "04-05-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Before I take your questions, let me just take a moment to recap what I believe is America's agenda in the coming months. Our trip to Europe advanced America's ideals and interests. Working with our partners, we won an agreement to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world, took new steps to strengthen the global economy, agreed to triple the debt relief provided for many of the poorest nations, and to strengthen democracy and reform in Russia. We also worked to put together, to put in place the building blocks of peace in Kosovo and to put the Balkans on a shared path to a prosperous, united future. I will meet with the region's leaders later this summer to give the process further momentum. I met with Kosovar refugees in Macedonia who are planning to return home. They thanked America and our Allies for giving them a chance to reclaim their lives on their native lands. I also met with and thanked some of the American air men and women who achieved the success and with some of our and other NATO troops who are going into Kosovo now to make sure we win the peace. They know that they are doing the right thing, and I am very proud of all of them. While America is enjoying success abroad, it is important that we keep pushing forward on our challenges here at home. This is a time of great hope for our Nation. Just today we learned that the American economy grew at a 4.3 percent in the first 3 months of this year. America plainly is on the right track. But we will be judged by what we do with this opportunity, whether we seize it or squander it in petty bickering and partisan animosity. This summer should be a season of progress. legislation to let disabled Americans keep their Medicaid health insurance when they go to work; an increase in the minimum wage; campaign finance reform; a strong and enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. I was heartened that earlier today the House overwhelmingly passed legislation making sure that foster children are not cast out in the cold when their time in foster care ends. This is a vital issue, one that Hillary has championed for many years. And I am very pleased by the House action.

And I can tell you the presidency does not change who you are, it reveals who you are. And Joe has shown himself to be a friend of working people. For eight years, Joe was the last one in the room when I faced a big decision. He made me a better president and he is got the character and experience to make us a better country.

Well, I get that this president wants full credit for the economy he inherited and zero blame for the pandemic that he ignored. Making stuff up does not make people's lives better. You have got to have a plan. You have got to put in the work. And along with the experience to get things done, Joe Biden has concrete plans and policies that will turn our vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into a reality. We literally left this White House a pandemic playbook that would have shown them how to respond before the virus reached our shores.

Do you need it? No, we do not have to have it, but I want as big a vote as possible in both communities. And I want this to be an agreement where we, for once and for all, we get rid of the zero-sum game in Northern Ireland politics which says if one side is happy with something, that means I am unhappy. Both communities, both traditions, if you like, within Northern Ireland can be satisfied with this, because for the Unionists, the principle of consent is there; for the Nationalist community there is fairness and equity of treatment, the recognition of the Nationalist identity. That is what this is you know, I said this on Good Friday after that marathon negotiation we went through, that in the end it is not a fudge, this agreement; it is an historic settlement of Nationalist and Unionist aspirations. And what it means is that in a new world, 2 years off the millennium, where everything is changing around the Republic of Ireland, Europe, Britain, our relations with the rest of the world, where people can argue their case free in the knowledge that they can do so democratically rather than by resorting to violence now, that is the historic settlement. And that is why I want as many people in both communities to come out and support it. Can this be a winwin situation for both sides? There is no question in my view that, if they vote for the accord, it will turn out to be a win-win. I mean, think about where the world is going to be in 12 years.

Secondly, leadership had to emerge on both sides that was committed to the two-state solution and leadership that was committed to recognizing that extremists are trying to undermine that solution and must be dealt with, particularly the Palestinian leadership. President Abbas understands that there are people, sometimes inspired by foreign government, that will do everything in their power to stop the advance of a democracy. He is committed to dealing with that. Sometimes you have got to make sure, though, that the commitment is coupled with the capacity to deal with it, and that is one of the concerns that we are helping them deal with. In other words, the Palestinian leadership as well as the Israeli leadership has to know that when they negotiate a vision, it will be supported by people in the region. One of the failures of the past is that people attempted to lay out a state- lay out the vision of a state, and yet there was not regional support, which made the political-the politics on the ground much more difficult for the leadership. And so I-those three issues have been addressed in the runup to Annapolis. Finally, this really is a leadership issue that we are talking about. The United States can help, and I will help, and the State Department under Condi Rice's leadership will help, and the National Security under Hadley's leadership will help. We will help them make hard decisions. But these decisions must be made by the leadership in order for there to be lasting peace. And when those decisions are made, they must be supported by the region. And so I think those ingredients are now in place, and I am optimistic that it will get done by the time I leave office, and more importantly, so is President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert. Now, what is going to happen is, is that there will be moments-there will be issues over settlements or Katyusha rocket attacks. These are going to be opportunities for those who do not want the vision to go forward to keep the process mired. We have a way to deal with that, and that is through a trilateral-the roadmap group to deal with these issues.

Let us do not do that until we know we have done what is necessary to save Social Security for the 21st century.

But what I do believe is that if somebody did not have a problem with their daddy being employed by the federal government, and did not have a problem with the Tennessee Valley Authority electrifying certain communities, and did not have a problem with the interstate highway system being built, and did not have a problem with the GI Bill, and did not have a problem with the subsidizing the suburbanization of America, and that all helped you build wealth and create a middle class-and then suddenly as soon as African Americans or Latinos are interested in availing themselves of those same mechanisms as ladders into the middle class, you now have a violent opposition to them, then I think you at least have to ask yourself the question of how consistent you are and what is different, what is changed.

We are suddenly now of the notion that somebody who is a police officer or firefighter having some affinity and familiarity with the community they are serving is completely out of bounds. So I think that one of the things I am always trying to do is to just promote a consistent philosophy and ethic about how government can help everybody and try to show that what worked for the majority community in previous generations would be likely to work now, too.

While I have thought it desirable to point out dangerous tendencies, I know that with few exceptions the management of our Government has been and is in honest and competent hands, that its finances are sound and well managed, and that the business interests of the nation, including the owners, managers and employees, are representative of honorable and patriotic motives, and that the present economic condition warrants a continuation of confidence and prosperity. It has both the power and disposition to maintain itself in a healthy economic and moral condition. But it can not do this by turning all its thoughts in on itself, or by making its material prosperity its supreme choice. Selfishness is only another name for suicide. The progress of the world rests on courage, honor and faith. If America wishes to maintain its prosperity, it must maintain its ideals. When we turn to our foreign relations, we see the working out of the same laws. If there is one ideal of national existence to which America has adhered more consistently than to any other, it has been that of peace. Whatever other faults may be charged to our country, it has never been quarrelsome, belligerent, or bent on military aggrandisement. After all, the main support of peace is understanding. It is a matter of accurate information by one government and one people about other governments and other peoples. If our country is to stand for anything in the world, if it is to represent any forward movement in human progress, these achievements will be measured in no small degree by what it is able to do for others. Up to a little more than twenty-five years ago, America gave almost its entire attention to self-development. In that it achieved an unequaled success.

I hope you have not heard it before, because usually I am an after-dinner speaker instead of a before-dinner speaker. But the joke that I was going to tell you was a little story that took place in ancient Rome at the Colosseum. A little band of Christians out there in the sand on the floor of the Colosseum, crowd up there in the seats, and then they were going to turn the lions loose on them. And the lions came roaring out and charging down on this little huddled mass of people. And one of them stepped forward and said a few quiet words, and the lion stopped and laid down. Well, the crowd was enraged that they were not going to get the show that they'd expected. Caesar was so mad that he had them bring the man to him, and he said, What did you say that made the lions act like that? He said, I just told them that after they ate there would be speeches. As one chief executive among many, I feel right at home. I have always said one of the greatest strengths of America is the diversity of our Federal system. As we have begun to loosen the bonds of centralized control, the States have shot forward, often showing Federal Government the way. The American people now look to the Republican Party as the party of new ideas. And it is Republican Governors who are out front, taking risks, breaking new ground, putting those new ideas into practice-everything from enterprise zones to welfare reform.

But speaking for my wife, Nancy, and myself, may I say you have more than made us feel at home. The warmth of your welcome has touched our hearts. In welcoming us, you pay tribute to the more than 230 million Americans whom I have the privilege to represent. The bonds of friendship which unite us are even greater than the ocean which divides us. It was a dozen years ago on an autumn day like this one that I first visited Japan, and today, as then, I feel energy, initiative, and industry surging through your country in a mighty current for progress. You do not build your future at the expense of the grace and beauty of your past. Harmony is a treasured hallmark of Japanese civilization, and this has always been pleasing to Americans. Harmony requires differences to be joined in pursuit of higher ideals, many of which we share. When former President Ulysses S. Grant visited here in 1878, he discovered Japan is a land of enchantment. During his stay, he met with the Emperor, and their discussion turned to democracy, the pressing issue of the day. President Grant observed that governments are always more stable and nations more prosperous when they truly represent their people. the 100th session of the Diet under the modern Japanese Constitution. In 6 years you will celebrate your 100th anniversary of representative government in Japan, just as we will celebrate the birth of our own Congress. I bring you the best wishes and heartfelt greetings from your American counterparts, the Congress of the United States. One cannot stand in this chamber without feeling a part of your proud history of nationhood and democracy, and the spirit of hope carrying the dreams of your free people. Of all the strengths we possess, of all the ties that bind us, I believe the greatest is our dedication to freedom. Japan and America stand at the forefront of the free nations and free economies in the world. Yes, we are 5,000 miles apart; yes, we are distinctly different in customs, language, and tradition; and yes, we are often competitors in the world markets. But I believe the people represented by this proud parliament and by my own United States Congress are of one heart in their devotion to the principles of our free societies.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressbeforethejapanesediettokyo", "title": "Address Before the Japanese Diet in Tokyo", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-before-the-japanese-diet-tokyo", "publication_date": "11-11-1983", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

In the diversity of languages, religions, political opinions, and racial and cultural groups, India is comparable to the continent of Europe, which has a total population about the same size as your own. Yet India has forged her vast mosaic of humanity into a single great nation that has weathered many challenges to survival both as a nation and as a democracy. This is surely one of the greatest political achievements of this century or any other century. India and the United States are at one in recognizing the right of free speech-which Mahatma Gandhi called the foundation-stone of Swaraj or self-government and the rights of academic freedom, trade union organization, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion. All these rights are recognized in international covenants. There are few governments which do not at least pay lip service to them. And yet, to quote Gandhi once more, No principle exists in the abstract. Without its concrete application it has no meaning. In India, as in the United States, these rights do have concrete application, and they have real meaning, too. It is to preserve these rights that both our nations have chosen similar political paths to the development of our resources and to the betterment of the life of our people. There are differences between us in the degree to which economic growth is pursued through public enterprise on one hand and private enterprise on the other hand. But more important than these differences is our shared belief that the political structure in which development takes place should be democratic and should respect the human rights of each and every citizen in our countries. Our two nations also agree that human needs are inseparable from human rights; that while civil and political liberties are good in themselves, they are much more useful and much more meaningful in the lives of people to whom physical survival is not a matter of daily anxiety. To meet these ends orderly economic growth is crucial. And if the benefits of growth are to reach those whose need is greatest, social justice is critical as well. India is succeeding in this historic task. Your economic challenges are no secret, and their seriousness is well understood in the West. But what is far less well understood is the degree to which Indian social and economic policy has been such a success. In the single generation since your independence was gained, extraordinary progress has been made.

I told them these cuts will hurt our economy. They will cost us jobs. They fought hard to recover from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and we will get through this as well. Even with these cuts in place, folks all across this country will work hard to make sure that we keep the recovery going. At a time when our businesses have finally begun to get some traction-hiring new workers, bringing jobs back to America-we should not be making a series of dumb, arbitrary cuts to things that businesses depend on and workers depend on, like education and research and infrastructure and defense. And at a time when too many Americans are still looking for work, it is inexcusable. Now, what is important to understand is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts right away. Beginning this week, many middle class families will have their lives disrupted in significant ways. Businesses that work with the military, like the Virginia shipbuilder that I visited on Tuesday, may have to lay folks off. Communities near military bases will take a serious blow. Hundreds of thousands of Americans who serve their country-Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, civilians who work at the Pentagon-all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs. All of this will cause a ripple effect throughout our economy. Layoffs and pay cuts means that people have less money in their pockets, and that means that they have less money to spend at local businesses. That means lower profits. That means fewer hires. a slow grind that will intensify with each passing day. So economists are estimating that as a consequence of this sequester, that we could see growth cut by over one-half of 1 percent. It will cost about 750,000 jobs at a time when we should be growing jobs more quickly. So every time that we get a piece of economic news, over the next month, next 2 months, next 6 months, as long as the sequester is in place, we will know that that economic news could have been better if Congress had not failed to act. None of this is necessary. It is happening because a choice that Republicans in Congress have made.

And I think that the framework that we have put forward, which says not only that people's taxes do not go up on January 1st, but also that we extend unemployment insurance for a year, that we make sure that key provisions like the college tax credit, the child tax credit, the earned-income tax credit are included -- that that framework is going to serve as the basis for compromise. But Democrats have said they are willing to let that go if they do not get some changes to this plan. Well, what I suspect is that there are going to be some discussions both between the House and the Senate. My understanding is that the Senate's going to vote on the package over the next several days and that at the end of the day, people are going to conclude we do not want 2 million people suddenly without unemployment insurance and not able to pay their rent, not able to pay their mortgage, not able to pay their house note. I think that people are also going to understand that the single most important thing we can do for all of our constituencies is to make sure that the recovery that is taking place right now gets stronger. And over the last 48 hours, a range of independent economists -- both left and right -- have concluded that this package would, in fact, increase potential economic growth by as much as 1 percent and could end up meaning an additional million and a half jobs. And that, I think, has got to be the highest priority for everybody. When you negotiated with Republicans, or after you finished, you compared the situation to negotiating with hostage takers. Now that your fellow Democrats, some of them, seem to be the hostage-takers, are you going to be able to give some ground to them?

The budget minister of Franois Hollande lied to the people in France about a hidden Swiss account when he was trying to do something about the tax evasion. What is your reaction to that? And what will you say for public officials in terms of probity? Well, I am not aware of that and I will not comment on what seems to be an internal matter in France. So I really do not have a response. I have two questions. One, yesterday, hundreds of minorities from Bangladesh, including Hindus, Buddhists and Christians, were demonstrating outside the White House. What they were saying, a message for the President that it should read that they are being targeted in Bangladesh because of their race and religion and their beliefs. And whenever there is a problem in Bangladesh and minorities are under attack by the extremists and groups. I do not have a specific response to the demonstration. Obviously, the administration and the President support the civil rights of peoples around the world, but I am just not aware of the specific demonstration or the issues in terms of a presidential response. And as far as guns are concerned, yesterday hundreds of Sikhs were at the Indian Embassy celebrating the Vaisakhi, their national holiday. And talking to them, what they are saying that among them were the families of the victims from Oak Creek, Wisconsin. What they are saying is that guns kill -- it does not matter how many rounds, and it should be banned at all completely, because as long as guns are in the wrong hands of the people, there will be -- people will be killed. And that is the message they were telling me to send to the President and to the Congress. The President's approach is one that embraces common-sense measures to reduce gun violence that do not infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of the American people, Second Amendment rights that the President supports. And you have seen that reflected in the legislation that he supports up on Capitol Hill and in the set of proposals that he made and announced together with the Vice President earlier this year.

One is, in a country as big and diverse as ours, how do you get more kids to take math and science courses at more advanced levels?

I think-the one thing I would say is that some States-I noticed California passed a really sweeping initiative this last year to try to give bonuses to people who will enroll-I think that what you are going to see inevitably in the future is that you will have to have more alternative certification mechanisms, and you will have to pay people more.

Secretary Espy has used and will continue to use every bit of flexibility that he has under the present law to try to save as many farmers as possible and to try to deal with the individual situations that we face.

Is it possible for the Federal Government to restore everything 100 percent? It is not possible to restore everything 100 percent because some of these programs are loan programs. But there are a lot of things that can be done. I believe, with the flexibility the Secretary has asked for that will keep these people farming.

Now, when you meet President Yeltsin in a few days in Tokyo, on these lines what would your posture be there? How would you address these issues? And let me remind you that our Prime Minister Chernomyrdin was unable to come here because there were some differences unresolved yet. I would say first, we have a lot more in common than we have which divides us, that I am very proud of the support that the United States and, indeed, that the G-7 gave to the movement toward democracy and the fact that President Yeltsin stood up for the democratic process in Russia. And I am proud of the courage shown by the Russian people in trying to move toward a market-oriented economy as well as to preserve democracy. And our overriding interests at the C, -7 meeting in my judgment is to continue to provide assistance to Russia in that effort. And I will strongly support it. Now, are we going to have differences of opinion from time to time? I called President Yeltsin about that matter. We are trying to work it out. I still think we really need this bilateral cooperation. I want the Vice President and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin to meet and to talk about what we can do on cooperating in space, cooperating on nuclear issues, cooperating on environmental issues. But we are going to have differences from time to time. That happens in life. You are talking about support. Can we expect anything significant and concrete at the G-7 concerning the aid to Russia? The United States committed $1.6 billion at Vancouver. We have another bill moving through our Congress that deals largely with energy and nuclear issues and environmental issues, as well as student exchanges and the attempt to privatize-assistance to privatize industry in Russia. It has passed one House of our Congress overwhelmingly and will pass the other shortly. The IMF, 2 days ago, released the first $1.5 billion in authority to Russia.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists9", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-9", "publication_date": "02-07-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

I intend to spend at least half my time at home, when I am not traveling and doing other things, because I have got a library and a public policy center to build, and I want it to be great, and I want it to be a great gift to my State. I have worked quite hard on it and thought a lot about it. And I think that I think the people at home will be quite excited about it when they see what we are going to do and will be thrilled by it. Sir, on Wednesday the deadline looms, and I was wondering whether or not if the IRA does not sign up for disarmament in time for Wednesday's deadline, whether or not or a timeline is established for disarmament will Gerry Adams still be allowed to come to the United States and raise funds? And secondly, do you have any personal words that you'd like to express to the people who are about to undergo another marching season, where it is been a very volatile and very bloody situation at times? I'd like to answer the second question first. The people of Northern Ireland, a majority of both communities, voted for the Good Friday accords. They voted for peace, for decommissioning, for universal acceptance of the principle of consent. And in American terms, that is majority rule. They voted for new partnerships with the Irish Republic, and they voted for self-government. They were right when they voted for that agreement. It is still the right thing for the future of Northern Ireland. So I would ask those who march and those who are angry at the march to remember that. I do not want to answer your first question for a simple reason I have been in intense contact with Prime Minister Blair and with Prime Minister, the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern.

Yes, Iran kind of the common threats will be on the agenda. For me as you know, I am a big believer in freedom. Interesting that Europe is now whole, free, and at peace, and there is a reason why. And we got to, in my judgment, extend that same concept to the Middle East, from which a lot of violence comes. And obviously, one of the problems that we face is preventing Iran from developing the know-how as to how to make a nuclear weapon.

And so I would come home from work, and I would write in my journal or write a story or two. The great thing was that it was useful in my organizing work. Because when I got there, the guy who had hired me said that the thing that brings people together to have the courage to take action on behalf of their lives is not just that they care about the same issue, it is that they have shared stories. And he told me that if you learn how to listen to people's stories and can find what is sacred in other people's stories, then you will be able to forge a relationship that lasts. What were your short stories like? It is interesting, when I read them, a lot of them had to do with older people. I think part of the reason was because I was working in communities with people who were significantly older than me. We were going into churches, and probably the average age of these folks was 55, 60. A lot of them had scratched and clawed their way into the middle class, but just barely. They were seeing the communities in which they had invested their hopes and dreams and raised their kids starting to decay steel mills had closed, and there had been a lot of racial turnover in these communities. And so a bunch of the short stories I wrote had to do with that sense, that atmosphere. One story is about an old black pastor who seems to be about to lose his church, his lease is running out and he is got this loyal woman deacon who is trying to buck him up. Another is about an elderly couple a white couple in L.A., and he is like in advertising, wrote jingles. And his wife is trying to convince him that his life is not over. So when I think back on what is interesting to me, there is not a lot of Jack Kerouac, open-road, young kid on the make discovering stuff. Was writing partly a way to figure out your identity? For me, particularly at that time, writing was the way I sorted through a lot of crosscurrents in my life race, class, family.

I want to express my gratitude to Paul Volcker for the part he played in these accomplishments. And I want to restate my confidence in Alan Greenspan to carry these accomplishments still further, all the while maintaining the Fed's traditional independence. Here in our own country, Chairman Greenspan will bring all his skill to bear upon the task of promoting our continued economic growth while keeping inflation low. Today, keeping down inflation and sustaining economic growth is not an either-or proposition. Today, low inflation and economic growth can and must go hand in hand. Abroad, Chairman Greenspan will have to work closely with the heads of foreign central banks. With the entire globe becoming a single and highly competitive marketplace, Chairman Greenspan will play an important role in seeking solutions to the problems of developing countries and the massive debt some of them have accumulated. He will work to ensure an open and fair trading system among all nations. And he will be deeply involved in the restructuring and modernization of the American banking system to keep our own capital markets competitive with others around the world.

There is been a convergence of policy and technology that has changed the spirit of America.

I do not anticipate this changing in the next two years. How are you going to get Democrats to understand that compromise means the other side has to give something sometimes, one day?

You know that not every Democrat in the Democratic caucus agrees with me or agrees with each other in terms of complicated issues like health care. So it is important for me, then, to work every angle I can to get as much done as I can. If we had a parliamentary system, then this critique would make sense to me because you do as much as you can to negotiate with the other side, but at a certain point you have got your platform and you move it forward and your party votes for it.

And I think that it is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances. freedom of speech, freedom of expression, people being able to use social networking or any other mechanisms to communicate with each other and express their concerns.

In the greatest conflict the world has ever known, our forces fought no engagement more bitter or more bloody. In 82 days of fighting, America suffered more than 12,000 dead in this final epic battle, the most costly one during the entire Pacific war. At the very heart of this crucible was the fight for a hill called Sugar Loaf, the key to breaking the enemy's line across the south of the island, some of the grimmest combat our forces had ever seen. The marines on Sugar Loaf faced a hail of artillery, mortars, and grenades. They were raked by constant machinegun fire. Time and again, our men would claw their way uphill only to be repulsed by the enemy. Progress was measured by the yard. On May 14th, 1945, a 19-year-old corporal named Jim Day led several other marines to a shell crater on the slope of Sugar Loaf. What happened then surpasses our powers of imagination. On the first day in that isolated hole, Corporal Day and those with him fought off an advance by scores of enemy soldiers. That night he helped to repel three more assaults, as those with him fell dead or injured. Braving heavy fire, he escorted four wounded comrades, one by one, to safety.

And so I am sure the subject will come up, and I am looking forward to clarifying once again our position. The American press feels the same way when they talk to me. You might want to clarify that. Some of them are very serious this morning. King Hamad of Bahrain has launched democratic reforms that included a new Constitution, and Bahrain now has an elected Parliament. How do you assess this experiment, especially in light of your drive to spread democracy in the region? I have complimented His Majesty on recognizing that Bahraini-style democracy, a democracy that reflects the traditions, customs of Bahrain, is a important part of dealing with real threats that we face in the world, which is extremism based upon hopelessness; and that there is a true threat to peace, and that is radicals who prey upon frustrations of people in order to convince them to become suicide bombers and to kill in the name of an ideology. And the best antidote to that is democracy. And I applaud his efforts. And we are very active in helping nations, if they so choose to receive our help, in moving forward through the MEPI program, for example. And it is a way to help people build the institutions necessary for a-I repeat- a democracy that reflects their traditions and history of the respective countries. And people go at different paces. And I do not expect Jeffersonian democracy to break out instantly, nor do I expect the forms of government to reflect that which we have in the United States. But I do hope that people recognize that popular sovereignty, that listening to people and responding to people, is how to build a stable and peaceful world. And so I applaud His Majesty. I am looking forward to bringing up the subject with the Amir of Kuwait as well. You know, women are now very active in the Kuwaiti Parliament. My friend King Abdallah of Saudi Arabia does not get enough credit for beginning to reform his society. It is important for the American President not to insist that countries do it our way.

There is this idea now embodied in our four winners today, in 3M Dental Products, in Merrill Lynch Credit, in Solectron, and XBS, that you can always get better and that you can organize not only to do the right things but to do the right things right in a way that elevates the people who work for the enterprise, serves the general public better, and obviously supports the bottom line. It is nice to think that. If you get a multiple-choice question like that, it is not too easy to make an A. None of us do all the time. But we come here to celebrate what we can do at our best. I'd also like to thank the Department of Commerce, Secretary Daley, the National Institute of Standards and Technology for the support that they give to this endeavor. But most of all, I just want to say, just think about where this idea was 10 years ago and where it is today. Think about how many of the groundbreaking reforms that have been recognized in Baldrige Award winners in the past that are now just standard industry practice. Think about what it would be like if everybody would so shamelessly try to learn what their competitors are doing and do it at least that well and then figure out how to do it better, if in every area of human endeavor you did that. What do we celebrate? The stake the employees have in the company, the flexibility, the innovation, the creativity, the spirit of enterprise. It has brought America back. When I became President, and even when I was running for President, I saw that the 1980's, while they had been very tough on American business, had also produced a remarkable understanding that was widely shared throughout the country about what had to be done to be internationally competitive.

Should undocumented immigrants also be able to get subsidized healthcare? If they are working in the United States of America and they are paying taxes, they should have access to healthcare. They should have access to what everybody else has access to. You say on every undocumented worker.

And we are fortunate to have the Secretary of the Interior with us, Manuel Lujan. John Warner, Chuck Robb; Congressman George Allen, and other members of Congress. I am delighted to be with you on this special day. It is an honor to be here with the people of Orange County, for this is the community that nurtured the father of our Constitution, James Madison. Citizens of this county launched Madison's political career, sending him to the Virginia House of Delegates when he was just 25 years old. In 1789, Orange County, almost by itself, provided Madison's margin of victory in gaining a seat in the First Congress of the United States. Here is the home where Madison developed and sustained his deep love of liberty, of religious freedom, economic freedom, intellectual freedom. Here at Montpelier, Madison immersed himself in the historical and philosophic study that shaped our Constitution. And here, he promised his constituents he would work to enact a Bill of Rights. I am especially pleased to announce that our fiscal year '93 budget will seek $1 million in Federal support for the restoration of Montpelier. Two hundred years ago this week, the Virginia General Assembly ratified the Bill of Rights. And with this action, three-fourths of the States had approved the Bill of Rights, thus making it a part of our Constitution. Americans have celebrated all of 1991 as the bicentennial year of the Bill of Rights. And thanks to efforts by schools and foundations and corporations, government bodies, active individuals, we have marked the year with many outstanding educational programs, including a national tour exhibiting Virginia's own original copy of the Bill of Rights. Next year, an exhibit on the Bill of Rights, organized by the U.S. Information Agency, will be the centerpiece of the United States Pavilion at the Expo in Seville. Congress has resolved that we observe the Bill of Rights bicentennial with a Year of Thanksgiving for the Blessings of Liberty. As a gesture of my esteem for James Madison and his home community, I am signing here at Montpelier the Presidential proclamation of this bicentennial celebration.

When I first came into the Governor's mansion, I thought it would be a great way to improve efficiency if I asked everybody to work a few extra days a month-on Saturday. I cannot claim a lot of success with that one. But the best thing about this dinner is seeing how the ranks of Republican Governors have grown since last year. We are talking about a 50-percent increase-from 16 to 24 Governors. And we are looking to add to that number in the elections this year, with Bob Livingston running in Louisiana, Jack Reed in Mississippi, and John Harper in Kentucky. But the critical test will come in 1988. We have 12 gubernatorial races that year. Of these, 8 are seats that we have to hold on to and 4 then that we have to win. Few races could be more important, few campaigns more crucial, to the future of our country. What happens in those elections will have repercussions that extend far beyond the State capitals and far beyond State lines-all the way, in fact, to Washington, DC, and the House of Representatives on Capitol Hill. That is because reapportionment comes up in 1991. And in all too many cases, having a Republican Governor is the only shot we have at getting a fair deal. an end to the antidemocratic and un-American practice of gerrymandering congressional districts. In the races, Republicans won half a million more votes than the Democrats, but the Democratic Party won 31 more seats. In California, one of the worst cases of gerrymandering in the country, Republicans received a majority of votes in congressional races, but the Democrats won 60 percent more races. The Democratic-controlled State legislatures have so rigged the electoral process that the will of the people cannot be heard. They vote Republican but elect Democrats. A look at the district lines shows how corrupt the whole process has become. The congressional map is a horror show of grotesque, contorted shapes. Districts jump back and forth over mountain ranges, cross large bodies of water, send out little tentacles to absorb special communities and ensure safe seats. One Democratic Congressman who helped engineer the gerrymandering of California once described the district lines there as his contribution to modern art. it is the American values of fair play and decency.

What is your message that each of you have right now to persuade doubting Unionists or doubting Catholics to persuade? I think it is in many ways a battle between fear and emotion on the one hand and reason and hope on the other. And the fear and the emotion is totally understandable, but it is important that people vote for reason and hope. And I say that because people ask me for reassurances on certain of the key items of the agreement. They say, Reassure us that the IUC is not going to be disbanded or stop being a proper police force. I give that reassurance. I give the reassurance, the absolute commitment that, if the cross-community provisions in the agreement to exclude people from office if they engage in violence, if those do not work, then they will be changed. That will be in the legislation. I give the explicit commitment to people that decommissioning will be a factor that we take into account, a factor there, specified in the legislation, so that, if people are not abiding by the decommissioning arrangements of the independent commission on decommissioning, then that can mean their exclusion or removal from office. I give the explicit commitment that people, whether in the assembly or the shadow assembly, cannot sit in office in Northern Ireland if they are engaged in the ballot box and the gun as a twin strategy. But in the end, it depends whether people are really wanting to give themselves the chance for stability and prosperity in the future, because the alternative is not where we are now. So I hope that people will take that chance for the future. Well, of course, the United States is the home of the largest Irish diaspora, you know, both Irish Protestants and Irish Catholics. And so I suppose outside of the people involved, we care more about it than any other people. And I have worked hard to create the conditions within which the Irish could make their own peace. And what I would like to say is, first, I am convinced there will be a great deal of increased interest in and investment in and partnership with Northern Ireland if this matter can be carried forward.

{"id": 1754, "text": "We think that a lot of people responded to a theme, or at least I think so, in the presidential campaign of sacrifice to cut the deficit as long as that sacrifice is equal. The Btu tax was designed originally on the concept of equal sacrifice. But then all of these exceptions were added, and it really makes it appear that it is one of the most complicated proposals ever. Did you make a mistake allowing all the special exceptions to be included in the Btu tax? Some of them were included in the House of Representatives bill, and I did not agree with all of them. But let me say what I think was a good criticism of the tax and that is that we wanted the tax to restrain energy consumption in ways that promoted energy conservation and also supported fuel switching to more environmentally beneficial and more available natural gas. That bill, as drawn, would be a big boon to the natural gas industry in Texas and Oklahoma and throughout the United States. And that is one of the things we were trying to do. Now, some of the oil companies did not like it, but the people that were in the gas business liked it. We had a big Texas gas company, headed by a person who strongly supported President Bush in the last election, endorsed the economic program. ARCO and Sun Oil both endorsed the economic program, including the Btu tax. So Secretary Bentsen, who, as you know, has represented you in the Senate for a long time, offered the Senate a modified Btu tax which, instead of having all those particular exemptions, would basically have alleviated the burden of the Btu tax on industry and agriculture on the production sector but still given them an incentive to move toward natural gas wherever possible and would also have cut the Btu rate and would have replaced that with more spending cuts. From my point of view, unfortunately, we could not pass that through the committee because Senator Boren had said he would not vote for any tax based on the heat content of fuel. But I still think it was a good concept, and it will be interesting to see what happens if the Senate's version of the economic plan passes, to see what happens in the conference and what we come up with. What we have now is a gasoline tax that is been passed by the Senate committee, and you have called that regressive in the past.

I also want to thank Senator Lott and Senator Daschle in their absence and, indeed, all the Members who are here. And if you would just indulge me in one personal remark, this is probably the largest gathering of Members of Congress anywhere in Washington today, except in the Chambers of the House and Senate. And I would like to take a moment to pay my respects to the memory of our friend Congressman Bruce Vento, who passed away earlier today, a great teacher, a great Representative, a wonderful human being. I also want to join the previous speakers in thanking all those who worked so hard on it, Charlene Barshefsky and Gene Sperling, who accompanied her to China, and they worked on this deal until the 11th hour. We knew it would take until the 11th hour. We only hoped by then they would not be too tired to tell time, so we would be able to finish. I thank Secretaries Glickman, Summers, and Mineta; and Secretary Slater, Secretary Shalala, who are here, John Podesta and Sandy Berger. I cannot thank Bill Daley and Steve Ricchetti enough for the extraordinary job they did to lead our efforts to secure passage of this initiative, along with Chuck Brain and Mary Beth Cahill. I want to thank all the State and local officials, the retired officials and business leaders who helped us, and I would like to acknowledge two great champions of trade who I just saw in the audience, just because I am glad to see them, former Congressman Sam Gibbons and former Congressman and Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. This is a great day for the United States and a hopeful day for the 21st century world. This signing ceremony marks the culmination of efforts begun almost 30 years ago by President Nixon, built on by President Carter, who normalized our relations with China, pursued firmly by Presidents of both parties to normalize ties with China in ways that preserve our interests and advance our values. During that time, China has grown more prosperous and more open. As the world economy becomes vastly more complex and interconnected, China's participation in it, according to the rules of international trade, has only become more important for America, for Asia, and the world. Today we take a major step toward China's entry into the World Trade Organization and a major step toward answering some of the central challenges of this new century.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigninglegislationpermanentnormaltraderelationswithchina", "title": "Remarks on Signing Legislation on Permanent Normal Trade Relations With China", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-legislation-permanent-normal-trade-relations-with-china", "publication_date": "10-10-2000", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 5289, "text": "But, in 2008, when you were a candidate for president, you did use the term radical Islam. The fact of the matter is, is that I have never been politically or particularly concerned with the phrase. What I have been more concerned about is, how do we stop violent extremists from killing us? The reason that I have not used the particular phrase radical Islam on a regular basis is because, in talking to Muslim allies, in talking to the Muslim-American community here, that was being heard as if we were ascribing to crazy groups like ISIL or al Qaeda the mantle of Islam. And since we need them as allies, I think it is useful for us to listen to how the president of the United States' words and messages are being received, because, if we are going to defeat those organizations, we need help from the billion-plus Muslims in this world, so that they can help root out this perversion of Islam that is taking place. Speaking of allies, Donald Trump had a response and a view about NATO. He said, if one the Baltic nations were attacked, that he might not defend unless they were paying their dues. Now, you have talked about free-riders countries that rely on U.S. defense without pulling their share. Well, I think that anybody who has been paying attention knows there is a big difference between challenging our European allies to keep up their defense spending, particularly at a time when Russia has been more aggressive, and saying to them, you know what, we might not abide by the central tenet of the most important alliance in the history of the world, one that was built by Democrats and Republicans and has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy since the end of World War II. And for Mr. Trump, who has in the past suggested that America is weak and not looking out for its allies, to then maybe not have enough information or understanding, to go out and say that America might not stand by its solemn commitment to protect those same allies who stood with us after 9/11 when we were attacked, I think, is an indication of the lack of preparedness that he is been displaying when it comes to foreign policy.

And in fact, at that time, everybody said, this is not going to work. They are not going to abide by it. And yet, over a year and a half later, we know that they have abided by the letter of it. So we have I think shown that we are able to construct a mechanism, if, in fact, we get an agreement, to verify that all four pathways to a nuclear weapon are shut off. But what if they take the $100 million showered at them after sanctions are lifted and not take them to build movie theaters and hospitals in Tehran, but rather divert it to military use? So I just want to separate out the questions. There is one critique of a potential nuclear deal which is it will not hold, and Iran will cheat, and they will get a bomb. And I have confidence that if, in fact, we arrive at the kind of agreement that I am looking for, and that was described in Geneva but now has to be memorialized, then we will have cut off their path to a nuclear weapon and we will be able to verify it with unprecedented mechanisms. Now, it may be that Iran is not able to make the necessary concessions for us to know we can verify it - Now, that is wishful thinking - - and they have got $100-$150 billion, and now they can do even more mischief around the region. I would make three points on that. Number one is that we will be putting in place a snapback provision so that if they cheat on the nuclear deal, the sanctions automatically go back into place; we do not have to ask Mr. Putin's permission, for example, to put sanctions back. Number two, we should not assume that we can perpetuate the sanctions forever anyway. There is a shelf life on the sanctions, because the reason the international community agreed was to get to the table to deal with the nuclear issue, not to deal with all of these other issues.

In fairness, I think that part of the calculation they were making was the way the contracts were written said, if you do not pay us immediately, then we can claim three times as much as we were owed under the bonuses. And so they were making a legal calculation, and their legal judgment was not necessarily wrong. The main thing we are going to do everything we can to see if we can get these bonuses back.

The problem is not just what is happened over the last 6 months. The problem is what was happening for years, where people were able to take huge, excessive risks with other people's money, putting the entire financial system at risk, and there were no checks, there were no balances, there was nobody overseeing the process. And so what we are going to be moving very aggressively on, even as we try to fix the current mess, is make sure that before somebody makes a bad bet you say, hold on, you cannot do that.

Before Oliver Wendell Holmes took his seat on the Supreme Court, he met a supporter who wished him well in his new duties. The supporter expressed satisfaction that Holmes would be going to Washington to administer justice. I am going there to administer the law. to apply the laws as written and not to advance their own agendas. He knew that it was up to elected officials, not appointed judges, to represent the popular will. Our Founders gave the judicial branch enormous power. It is the only branch of Government whose officers are unelected. That means judges on the Federal bench must exercise their power prudently, cautiously, or some might even say, conservatively. And that means that the selection and confirmation of good judges should be a high priority for every citizen. We have seen the profound impact that judges can have on the daily lives of every citizen. We saw the power of judges in 2002, when the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declared the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional because it contained the words under God. We saw the power of judges in the Kelo decision, a 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court that ruled that governments could seize people's homes for private development. The government decided the seizure was for the greater good. We saw the power of judges in Boumediene v. Bush. There, a 5-4 majority rejected the carefully crafted procedures Congress established for detainees held at Guantanamo Bay in response to a prior Supreme Court decision. And for the first time, the Court awarded foreign terrorists held overseas legal rights previously reserved for American citizens. Recently we have also seen the important role of judges in the rulings of a very different 5-4 majority. We saw this last year, when five members of the Supreme Court upheld a law banning the grisly practice of partial-birth abortion. We saw it again this June, when that same slender majority stood up for the plain meaning of our Constitution and upheld the rights of citizens under the Second Amendment. Judges matter. And that means the selection of good judges should be a priority for all of us. I appreciate that many people listening today and here in this room have worked hard to recruit more Americans to this cause.

So people get to see this wonderful library of America, great old portrait of George Washington, and as I was telling you a moment ago, the little-known anonymous design for the White House by Thomas Jefferson. He tried to become the architect of the White House anonymously, and his design was rejected in favor of this one. You were mentioning that certain Presidents dominate this house, as opposed to how they may be viewed in history. What did you mean by that? What I meant was most of the Presidents who are dominant here were very important Presidents, or all of them. a bedroom named for him, the room where he signed the Emancipation Proclamation, his statues and portraits everywhere. He put both of the round porches on the White House and changed the front to the back of the White House and the back to the front. Theodore Roosevelt built both the wings, and his portraits are everywhere and his vigor and youth. Franklin Roosevelt lived here longer than everyone else, but he has just a couple of portraits here in the house and a very modest presence, considering the fact that he was plainly the dominant personality in terms of the length of time that he dominated here. So it is just sort of interesting who dominates, because of the contributions they made to the house itself, I think.

What we have done is to set up a bilateral discussion between our State Department and counterparts in Russian to find out how do we create an agreement in which children are protected.

One, everybody was on bicycles; there were not many automobiles. I happened to be one of the people on bicycles. I rode all over the place in Beijing, which was fascinating. In other words, there was not much exposure to the West, and all of a sudden an American starts riding a bike amongst them, and it, frankly, surprised some people.

And I am wondering, when you are moving towards, sort of, a more integrated approach to security on things like NORAD, why move ahead with something that really amounts to a bit more of a restriction? Well, I think-first of all, we have the same issue to the south, by the way. How do you come up with a policy where there are thousands of border crossings a day, without-and trying to have a rational approach to determining who is coming in and who is going out of the country, without endangering workforce, tourism, trade? Our goal is to, obviously, consult with our partners to develop, you know, passport and/or passport-like document, you said, and I think that may be the operative word as a plan develops. There is a desire for a lot of our citizenry-and it is reflected in the Congress- to know, as I said, who is coming in and who is going out and why. And I think that-I am pretty confident that if we work closely, we can develop such a plan that enables a scanning device or a card that can be dealt with on a scanning device to not stop the flow of traffic of people who make a daily routine of it, and also make sure that we know who is coming in the country. The purpose is not to impede trade and/ or cross-border relations. The purpose is to expedite them in a way that gives both countries, or all three countries, comfort in knowing who is coming across. In Texas, for example, like in El Paso, on a daily basis, there is thousands of people that it is just a part of their daily routine.

Is not there any way that we can design a national program to educate people ? On the to go to your point when Hillary and I decided that we ought to have this grassroots campaign to try to protect children against violence and we began to talk to Pam Eakes, who started the Mothers Against Violence movement in Washington State, and others, one of the things that we learned, obviously, is that a lot of young people wind up being especially really troubled young people can often be almost strangers in their own homes. And we assume that people ought to just know how to do the most important jobs in life, and they are very often reluctant to ask for help. But I think one of the things that we have to try to do is to develop the kind of supports parents need to do a better job. And it is a much harder job now than it used to be, especially since the average parent is away from his or her children for 22 hours a week more than was the case 30 years ago. So I do think that we need to do some more. Most parents, however, want to do a good job, really, really want to do a good job. And I think when you start with that, one of the things that I hope very much will come out of this whole movement against teen violence is more efforts in that regard. Of course, that is one of the reasons that Hillary wrote her book a few years ago she knows more about that than I do and, of course, one of the reasons the Vice President and Mrs. Gore had those family conferences every year, starting before he joined the ticket with me back in '92. The short answer to your question is, yes, we should do more to help parents do a good job. ENTITY, a lot of Medicare beneficiaries are enthusiastic about the idea of a new prescription drug benefit but perhaps less enthusiastic about paying higher premiums to pay for it. Should Medicare beneficiaries, themselves, be prepared to endure some pain to get some gain? Should they be prepared to pay higher premiums?

Should it come under the FDA? It should come under the FDA unless Congress is willing to write these requirements into law. Now, the FDA itself, Dr. Kessler said he did not care about regulating tobacco. If Congress would take the things we want to do and put it into law, the FDA would lose jurisdiction. They would not be able to do it on an ongoing basis, but the benefit we would get is then the move against teen smoking would begin right away whereas tobacco companies can tie us up in court for a while otherwise. So the FDA head, Dr. Kessler, has said that he will do it either way. But he would gladly give up jurisdiction to the Congress if, but only if, the Congress would take the same tough stand that we have recommended. Well, we are all over the board today. I believe on balance that both NAFTA and GATT will be a major boon to American agriculture. I was just out in California meeting with a lot of farmers there. And virtually all of them talked about how much stronger agriculture was as a result of it. With regard to NAFTA and Mexico, some of our livestock people have been concerned about how NAFTA would play and whether it would hurt them. With the GATT agreement, which is a worldwide trade agreement, there is no question that our farmers will be better off because other countries subsidize their farmers more than we subsidize ours. So if everybody has to reduce subsidies to an equal basis, American farmers will come out way ahead because we have the best, most competitive, most productive farmers in the world. If we can get a decent farm bill out of the Congress, that is, one that continues to reduce the cost of the farm programs but does not take us out of global competition and does not really wreck the family farm, then I think the future of agriculture is bright. In fact, I think we may have seen a bottoming out of the number of farmers. We may see the same or even a larger number of farms in the years ahead because global population would probably outstrip the ability of other countries to produce food. So farming should do very well in America for the next 20 or 30 years if we have a good farm bill and if these trade agreements are faithfully followed by all the countries.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithlarrykingculvercitycalifornia", "title": "Interview With Larry King in Culver City, California", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-larry-king-culver-city-california", "publication_date": "21-09-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

They want their kids to have a first-class education. They know from practical experience that a good education is absolutely essential to making a good living and to making a good life. So let me just share a little from that meeting. Janette Williams told me about her son, Javon. The Williamses are here with us somewhere here today whoops, here she is over here. Her kid starred on 60 Minutes, and that says something about the guy, if you go on that program and come off in one piece. But here is what she said, and this is serious. She said, At his old school that was crowded, he used to get so bored that he would walk out. And thanks to the choice program in Milwaukee, he is at a new school. He is not doing those things anymore. He is doing his homework; he is even helping clean up the classroom after school. They took the energy and turned it around. Now, the Governor here, Tommy Thompson, the Governor of Wisconsin, is here with us today. I am sorry that Polly Williams, who is been at the forefront of the school choice movement, could not be here, but she is at home looking after her mother. I would salute her values. But we miss her very, very much. Together, Polly and Tommy Thompson, the Governor, have taken the lead in helping parents like Janette Williams realize her dreams for her son Javon, creating scholarships for 1,000 Milwaukee children from low-income families so that they can attend private schools. Now, theirs is a bold experiment, to give low-income families more of the same choices of schools already available to wealthier families. Mike Joyce of the Bradley Foundation was also in our meeting. And Bradley recently joined with other foundations and Milwaukee businesses to raise $3 million so that Milwaukee's low-income families will be able to choose their family's schools, including the religious schools. Mike told us this morning that parents picked up every one of the 4,500 scholarship applications the day after the scholarships were announced, 4,500, that fast.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksannouncingproposedlegislationestablishgibillforchildren", "title": "Remarks Announcing Proposed Legislation To Establish a GI Bill for Children", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-announcing-proposed-legislation-establish-gi-bill-for-children", "publication_date": "25-06-1992", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Well, there are certain occasions when we leave notes for each other and things of that kind that we still do.

A lot of people got charged with criminal offenses, simply because they refused to lie, and it did a lot of damage to our political system for no good end.

One of the big issues- that is important for people's vision of the American role-very important. You know, during the course of the campaign, I made it clear that I thought that our military should be used to fight and win war-that is what I thought the military was for-and that I was concerned about peacekeeping missions and that we have got to be very clear about-to our friends and allies about how we use our troops for nation-building exercises, which I have rebuffed as a-basically rebuffed as a kind of a strategy for the military. And as a result of that, some in Europe were very concerned about our presence in the Balkans, for example. We came in together. That is an important statement for people to understand, that our Nation will continue to work with our European friends-in this case, to bring stability to the Balkans and Macedonia. We have got an Ambassador on the ground there working with the EU Ambassador to bring peace. Having said that, it is important, however, to continue to work, though, to replace troops in a responsible manner with civil institutions, civil structures that can do the same thing the troops are doing. We have got to work for a police force and security arrangements that are run locally, so that the NATO troops at some point in time will no longer serve as peacekeepers. Now, that is obviously more opportunistic to do that in Bosnia than it is in Kosovo at this point in time, but nevertheless, we must do so. In terms of the EU, I believe that we can have a very constructive relationship with the EU. Obviously, there are some concerns where we differ, but we should not allow these differences-like biotechnology, for example, which I talked about today in my speech regarding developing nations.

This concept of a living Constitution gives unelected judges wide latitude in creating new laws and policies without accountability to the people. And then there was another side, which I happened to be a part of, that said we needed judges who believed that the Constitution means what it says. When asked if I had any idea in mind of the kinds of judges I would appoint, I clearly remember saying, I do. Judge Scalia recently gave an interview on the TV show 60 Minutes. I do not know if you are supposed to call it a TV show, kind of newsworthy show. He talked about the schoolchildren who visit the Supreme Court and proudly recite what they had been taught about the living Constitution. Judge Scalia noted that he usually had the sad duty of telling the children that the Constitution was never alive. He believed, as I do and many in this hall believe, that the Constitution is not a living document, it is an enduring document, and good judges know the difference. And I made a promise to the American people during the campaign that if I was fortunate enough to be elected, my administration would seek out judicial nominees who follow that philosophy. We would search from a diverse array of candidates and nominate those who met the highest standards of competence. We would not impose any litmus tests concerning particular issues or cases. Instead, we would seek judges who would faithfully interpret the Constitution and not use the courts to invent laws or dictate social policy. And with your support, we have kept that pledge. I have appointed more than one-third of all the judges now sitting on the Federal bench, and these men and women are jurists of the highest caliber, with an abiding belief in the sanctity of our Constitution. The judicial philosophy that I brought to Washington, DC, is demonstrated most clearly by the-some of the judges I have named to the bench-matter of fact, all the judges I have named to the bench. One of them is the son of an Italian American-schoolteachers from Trenton, New Jersey. He graduated from Princeton and Yale Law.

In a real sense, the choice facing men in every nation today, old or young, large and small, is a choice between moving into the modern world with all of its unlimited potential or turning back toward the restrictive world that is dominated by the dogma and the doctrine of the 19th century. So, in your lifetimes, and in the lifetimes of a majority of the nations on earth, the total of human knowledge has doubled twice. The growth of human knowledge has made obsolete many of the causes of friction and contention and division among nations. Certainly the advance of human knowledge has made war itself obsolete and impossible as a means of resolving differences between large or small nations. Above all, the growth of human knowledge has rendered obsolete and archaic the doctrine on which the dogma of communism was constructed. Man today has in his capacity the potential of ending human misery or ending human life. We can really, for the first time, see the promise and the prospect of eliminating hunger and poverty, illness, bias, and prejudice in our own land and, we would hope, all around the world. So, this is the work that we want to do. And this is the work which your generation will do. And that is why I have said over, and over, and over again that we of the United States invite all peoples--East and West--to pull back their curtains, and to tear down their walls, and to come out of the darkness of dogma and walk all together in the bright light of human knowledge and human freedom toward the peace that mankind must make together, and must keep together, on this earth. I have seen many classes of Capitol pages graduate throughout the years. I would say that the class of which you are members faces the brightest and the most thrilling and the most hopeful prospects of any.

In their last message 2 days ago, they even proposed that this subject should be put to a referendum. They have specifically offered to dismantle all their operations, to retire completely from the business, and to eliminate drug trafficking from Colombia. What would be your reaction if the Colombian Government would eventually agree to this dialog? I would let the Colombians make their determination on how they want to treat problems in their own country. But I would be very wary of taking the word of an indicted drug dealer. I would be extraordinarily worried about that because I do not think they keep their word. I think these are people that the background on some of them, you know well, were common criminals until they got into the lucrative business of poisoning the kids not just in the United States but in Colombia as well and every other country as well. So, I am not sure the Colombian officials need free advice from me, but I would be very wary about that negotiation. And I think that the Government of Colombia has been very wary about that kind of negotiation because they know the kind of people they are dealing with.

Eighty-seven million dollars, which was given to our country basically in military equipment, is a welcome aid. We were very grateful for your help.

Could you consider and perhaps the meeting at the Andean summit might be the place to give, eventually, discussion to this would you be able to consider a type of Marshall plan for countries such as Colombia that are decidedly and deeply involved in the war on drugs?

I pledge to you that I will not shrink from the hard decisions needed to meet the problems facing each and every one of us. This is a critical hour in America's history. It requires that Americans once again rise above petty partisanship or factional interests in any segment of our society. The very future of our political and economic institutions, indeed our whole way of life, is literally at stake. Nations which cannot impose on themselves a disciplined management of their fiscal and monetary affairs are doomed to economic disorder and widespread inflation. Such discipline is imperative, it is urgent if we are to achieve a stable and expanding economy. The American people have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to submerge personal and group interests to the general welfare. When they know the chips are down, they are really down--and they have done it in the past, and they will do it again--they will respond as they always have. As part of the demanded discipline, I will send to the Congress a plan of action to keep Federal outlays for fiscal year 1975 at or under $300 billion. Every dollar the Federal Treasury must borrow is a dollar not available to the home buyer or the businessman trying to expand or other citizens who may be borrowers for good and sufficient reasons. A coherent national policy on energy is essential for economic stability. It must encourage prudent use of available energy. I will soon propose a national energy program aimed at assuring adequate internal supplies while reducing dependence on external sources. At this very minute, Secretaries Kissinger and Simon are exploring with their counterparts from four major industrial nations a coordinated plan to cope with a world energy crisis and world economic dislocations.

Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission - to make America great again for all Americans. Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul, and the steel in America's spine. Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy, racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip. We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water to help save more than 40 lives. Ashlee, we all thank you. We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg.

Although more than 200,000 Asian students now study in American colleges and universities, more Americans must immerse themselves in Asian societies and cultures. As the exchange of free people and ideas flows between our nations and as the cold war ends in victory for our cause, our economic relations have taken center stage. This brings me to the fourth and most important point. If we are to expand our economic ties, we must face up to the economic tensions that threaten our relations. We must reduce those tensions now by opening markets and by eliminating barriers to trade and investment. Japan will sell about $90 billion worth of goods and services to the United States this year. We will sell nearly $50 billion to Japan. Isolation and protectionism must remain the sleeping ghosts of the past, not the waking nightmares of the future. We must reject these failed notions in the sure knowledge that expanding markets mean expanding jobs and increasing prosperity for both our countries. We must ensure a continued strong two-way economic relationship between Japan and the United States, with markets more open to new goods and services, manufacturers more open to new competitive ideas, the financial services industry competing on a fair basis, and an equitable flow of technology on both sides. Our two countries share a special responsibility to strengthen the world economy. Yesterday the President and the Prime Minister announced a strategy for world growth which commits both our countries to domestic policies to stimulate growth. Expanded domestic demand in Japan translates into additional exports to Japan for American products and jobs at home. And we are seeking broad support for growth policies among other industrialized countries as well. Many American businesses learned during the past decade that the old ways no longer work in our changing international marketplace. Our companies have cut costs, improved quality, and championed innovation. As a result, our products sell in markets everywhere they have access. And candidly, such access is still limited in Japan.

And the Tibetan Buddhism as a religious faith, as a culture and a way of life, the ability of the Tibetan people to be free of any kind of economic or other handicaps and the signal it would send to the rest of the world about China's attitude about human dignity and diversity and difference of religion, race, and opinion the gains to China from doing this would far outweigh any marginal extra tension they might feel about the long-term future of Tibet in this context.

Every year we have to be looking ahead to find more and more markets for our products because as we get drawn into the global economy, we have got to sell more to other people to keep our incomes high. Secondly, we have a real interest in keeping Russia democratic and keeping them committed to reducing their nuclear arsenals. Because otherwise we have to turn right around and rebuild our defenses at very high levels, spend huge amounts of taxpayers' money on nuclear arsenals, raise our children in a more dangerous world, and divert needed resources which ought to be spent on education and training and investment here at home.

On Afghanistan, the President's apology of the burning of the Korans has not seemed to quell the violence, the protests at all. I am wondering if the White House is worried that there is no clear end in sight to this. Well, as you pointed out, Ben, General Allen, Secretary Panetta, and President Obama have all, in different forms, expressed their apology on behalf of the American people and the American military to the Afghan people to articulate that the United States military and, indeed, the American people have enduring respect for the religious views and religious practices of the Afghan people. We were pleased today to see that President Karzai himself has also called -- or appealed for calm in Afghanistan. And while this is a difficult circumstance that we are working through, we are confident that our goals in Afghanistan -- which I will remind you is to defeat, disrupt and dismantle al Qaeda and to ensure that al Qaeda cannot be used as a safe haven for al Qaeda or other religious extremists -- violent extremists -- so it is our view that we will work through these difficult circumstances and remain on track to making progress on our goals there. Is there anything else -- as this incident continues, is there anything else the President can do or plans to do that you know of? Nothing that I have to announce at this time. Speaking of no end in sight, on a much broader scale, of course, as you know, the slaughter in Syria continues. Secretary Clinton, at the conference in Tunisia, said that the regime will have more blood on its hands if it does not comply with the cease-fire. Is there any thought being given right now that you can help us understand about what happens next? Well, as you point out, Ben, Secretary Clinton is in Tunisia right now meeting with the Friends of Syria group in Tunis to talk about a number of things, including a political transition in Syria.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingprincipaldeputypresssecretaryjoshearnest", "title": "Barack Obama Press Briefing by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-principal-deputy-press-secretary-josh-earnest", "publication_date": "24-02-2012", "crawling_date": "04-07-2023", "politician": ["Josh Earnest"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 1872, "text": "Likewise no one doubts the importance of the government safety net for those in genuine need. Yet our national experience shows that when government grows beyond these two limited duties, when government lays claim to more and more of our resources and begins, through massive regulation and high taxation, to impinge on our individual freedoms, then our economy grows not more prosperous but less so. Throughout the 1970's, for example, government's growth was unbridled, yet our economy stagnated. By 1980 the gross national product registered zero growth. If it was not the Government that spurred our economic growth was it perhaps our natural resources? Our vast land has always been blessed by a mighty multitude of resources broad plains, powerful rivers, and rich deposits of minerals. Yet in a sense, the primary reality of a resource exists not in the earth but in the minds of the men and women who give it usefulness and value. A century ago oil was nothing but a thick, foul, and useless liquid. It was the invention of the internal combustion engine that gave oil its function. Or think of sand, sand that used to be nothing but the stuff that deserts are made of. The development of the silicon microchip has given sand a vital function. And today we use it to make chips that give home computers their intelligence, monitor functions on aircraft, and guide our satellites through the dark reaches of space. No, it is not been so much our resources or our government that have given us our enduring vibrancy and growth but the initiative and enterprise of individual Americans. Air travel, for example, has become commonplace because test pilots like Lindbergh had daring, and engineers like Boeing and Douglas had the wits and determination. The Government might have wished it could simply decree a polio vaccine, but it took years of unremitting effort and dedication by Doctors Salk and Sabin to make the vaccines a reality. In this setting, one story of a private initiative is particularly appropriate. Back in Missouri in the early 1900's there lived a farmboy who discovered that he had a knack for drawing barnyard animals. As an adult, he began to put his animals into cartoons, and he became convinced that he could entertain people by telling stories about a little creature with a high voice, red trousers, and yellow shoes and white gloves. Professionals in the field made fun of the idea, and to produce his first cartoons the young man had to sell or pawn virtually everything he owned.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksparticipantsthepresidentsinauguralbandsparadewaltdisneysepcotcenternear", "title": "Remarks to Participants in the President's Inaugural Bands Parade at Walt Disney's EPCOT Center Near Orlando, Florida", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-participants-the-presidents-inaugural-bands-parade-walt-disneys-epcot-center-near", "publication_date": "27-05-1985", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

As we have done on our previous tours, we will visit communities that have not fully participated in our Nation's economic growth. And yet, in the communities we will also see how partnerships between the public and private sectors can unleash the power of the Internet to link children and adults to a lifetime of learning, to provide access to distant medical care, to empower parents, to assist job seekers, to enhance safety, and foster economic development. Second, I am signing an executive memorandum to ensure that closing the digital divide will be a vital goal not just for Secretary Daley and for us here in the White House but throughout the Federal Government. For example, I am directing Secretary Daley to work with the private sector to develop a national strategy for connecting all Americans to the Internet and directing Secretaries Daley, Riley, Herman, Cuomo, and Shalala to expand our growing network of community technology centers. I just ask you all to think about this one thing. What do you believe the economic impact would be if Internet access and usage were as dense in America as telephone access and usage? I think it is clear that we need to keep working until we achieve this goal. Third, with the help of many other groups, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights is launching an initiative to empower the entire civil rights community through an expanding civilrights.org website, through leadership forums and even modern-day freedom riders who will bring high-tech training to the doorsteps of nonprofit organizations. As the Congress of National Black Churches has said, the digital divide is a key civil rights issue of the 21st century. That is why our civil rights organizations must be ready, wired, and able to lead the change. Fourth, the Benton Foundation is bringing together companies from across the computing, telecommunications, software, and Internet industries, as well as the Urban League and several other large private foundations, to create the Digital Divide Network, an enormous clearinghouse of information for information on public and private efforts to bring technology to underserved communities.

And I think that is an easy way of addressing that. As a father of two daughters, do you see that at all? Do you see that pressure in your own life? I mean some of this is just gender issues, generally. I mean when you are a dad of two daughters you notice more. When I was a kid I did not realize as much, or maybe it was even a part of which is the enormous pressure that young women are placed under in terms of looking a certain way. And are you wearing the right clothes? And that pressure I think is historically always been harder on African American women than just about any other women. But it is part and parcel of a broader way in which we socialize and press women to constantly doubt themselves or define themselves in terms of a certain appearance. And so Michelle and I are always guarding against that. And the fact that they have got a tall gorgeous mom who has some curves, and that their father appreciates, I think is helpful. I do think that culture's changing for the younger generation a little bit more. You see Beyonce or you see some of these pop stars and what both white, Latino, black children are seeing as representative of beauty is much broader than it was when I was a kid. You just did not see that much representation. I mean Malia will talk about black girl's hair and will have much opinions of that. And she is pretty opinionated about the fact that it costs a lot, it takes a long time, that sometimes girls can be just as tough on each other about how they are supposed to look. And so it is , as a parent, that is a constant learning process that you are trying to hold the fort. And that is why somebody like Misty ends up being so important. A lot of it is the power of that image, even if they are not dancers, even if they are not interested in pursuing a career in entertainment or the arts.

What needs to be understood here is that the debate and discussion about the President's AfPak policy took place, as you know, in the fall of 2009 and resulted in the President's decision of the policy that we have been implementing as an administration ever since, both militarily and through our civilian agencies. This decision about the size of the initial drawdown is one in keeping with the decision the President made back in December of 2009. In fact, the context for this decision is fairly narrow, which is what -- the President is, as he has all along, moving to the next stage of implementing a policy that he thought long and hard about in making a decision that he made in the fall -- or rather late 2009.

But it could dismantle your-your big thing. The thing that you gave everybody. but first of all, I am confident we will win because the law is clearly on our side. the case at issue is not whether the entire Affordable Care Act is legal. It is a very narrow statutory interpretation about whether those states that did not set up state exchanges but who is people are benefiting from subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, whether they still get those subsidies. If the supreme court were to decide against us, five to six million people could lose their health insurance. Well, they- who knows what they said. But people in California where there is a state exchange, or New York, they would not lose it. All the benefits that have happened for people who already had health insurance-not being discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition, making sure that women are not having to pay more than men then insurance- those things would not go away. On the other hand I can say unequivocally I can answer Ronald Reagan's question unequivocally Are you better off now than you were 4 years ago? And the answer is on every economic measure just about we are. So when I take an unemployment rate from 10 percent down to 5.5 percent, when I drive the uninsured rate to the lowest it is ever been, when I restore people's poor 01 case, when I make sure that we are doubling clean energy and we are reducing our carbon footprint and high school graduation is the highest it is ever been and college attendance is the highest they have ever been- and LGBT rights have been recognized and solidified in ways that we could not even imagine 10 years ago.

I know you are sitting there saying to yourself, Well, it is easy for him to say because they have already sanctioned. And the question facing countries is, does money trump effective diplomacy for the sake of peace and security? Postsurge, are things heading in the right direction, in your view? And as a result of violence being down, the economy is growing and political reconciliation is taking place. And the lesson learned in this postconflict period in both Iraq and Afghanistan is, you got to have security. I gave a speech at the Air Force Academy that said it is a different set of issues that we face now than we faced 60 years ago in postconflict. First of all, the conflicts took longer to resolve in World War II, and yet the reconstruction was done in relative peace and security. Here it took little time to accomplish the initial military objective, and reconstruction had to be done in the face of a lot of violence. And in 2006, it became apparent that our strategy of training and encouraging the Iraqis to take the lead was not working; sectarian violence was severe. As you know, I made the decision to send 30,000 more in because we recognized that and had belief that security would yield this kind of evolution of democracy, and it is. The number of laws they passed, the Iraqi Parliament have passed, have been I would say it certainly exceeded expectations. And they passed their budgets faster than we have passed our budgets. The British Government, Gordon Brown had said yesterday, I think, that he will announce sometime in the coming weeks future plans for British deployment in Iraq. British officers have acknowledged that in the recent fighting in Basra, the American military role was crucial to making sure that there was a response. Is there not a concern that, whatever the justifications for a British withdrawal, that a British pullout of troops could have an effect either on American deployment or on the situation as a whole?

In order to do that, you have got to get the debt and deficit under control and you have got to grow the economy. So if you take tax loopholes to fuel more spending, which is what they are proposing, then you are preventing tax reform, which we think is necessary, to end crony capitalism and to grow the economy.

Sometimes you read fiction just because you want to be someplace else. What are some of those books? It is interesting, the stuff I read just to escape ends up being a mix of things some science fiction. Oh, Liu Cixin, who won the Hugo Award.  It is really about the fate of the universe. The scope of it was immense. So that was fun to read, partly because my day-to-day problems with Congress seem fairly petty not something to worry about. There were books that would blend, I think, really good writing with thriller genres. I loved that structure. Fates and Furies, by Lauren Groff. I like those structures where you actually see different points of view. Which I have to do for this job, too. Have there been certain books that have been touchstones for you in these eight years? Like most teenagers in high school, when we were assigned, I do not know, The Tempest or something, I thought, 'My God, this is boring.' And I took this wonderful Shakespeare class in college where I just started to read the tragedies and dig into them. And that, I think, is foundational for me in understanding how certain patterns repeat themselves and play themselves out between human beings. It gives me a sense of perspective. I think Toni Morrison's writings particularly Song of Solomon is a book I think of when I imagine people going through hardship. I think that there are writers who I do not necessarily agree with in terms of their politics, but whose writings are sort of a baseline for how to think about certain things V. S. Naipaul, for example. His A Bend in the River, which starts with the line, The world is what it is; men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it.

So we do not have any signs of inflation, but should not they be worried about it, since nobody really thought we could have it? Everyone knows that the technology explosion, especially in telecommunications and information technology, has dramatically increased productivity in ways that traditional economic models do not measure. Is there any way we could keep this economic recovery going, creating even more jobs, raising incomes even more, and not have inflation? And the answer is, yes, if you can either find more customers for American goods and services or more workers to come in and produce more so they are not just being added on for the same level of production. Now, what are the possibilities for that? Expanded trade, which is why I have worked very hard to build a consensus in my own party for trade, plus labor and environmental standards- why I went to Geneva and made those speeches, why I went to the University of Chicago and all that-for trade. The most obvious ones in America are more people from welfare to work. Tonight I had Eli Segal at the fundraiser, if you listened in on that. He is now got 12,000 companies in this deal where we are trying to hire even hard-to-place welfare recipients and train them. Because that is adding to the productive capacity. You get people who are both workers and consumers. The other big discrete population are the disabled, which is why this thing that apparently we are going to have an overwhelming bipartisan majority of Congress do, which is to let disabled people keep their Medicaid in the work force, it is potentially a very big, positive contribution to long-term growth, because, again, you are creating more workers and more consumers.
