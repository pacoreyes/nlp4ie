Even before the Gulf war, but especially in its aftermath, Japan has continued to define its growing role in world affairs. An increasingly active, engaged, and responsible Japan is critical to a forward-looking post-cold-war community. This brings us to the second area of our relationship, our foreign policy cooperation. We must fulfill the bright promise of our global partnership. Together, we produce 40 percent of the world's gross national product. We contribute together 40 percent of all bilateral aid. We have the ability to marshal unrivaled resources to build a better future if our foreign policies are well coordinated. America has a responsibility here, but it is a responsibility we share with Japan. The upcoming conference on assistance to the nations of the former U.S.S.R., now the Commonwealth of Independent States, is a timely example of such foreign policy coordination. The collapse of the Soviet Union has also spurred questions within Japan about the durability of U.S.-Japan alliance. For decades, this alliance has stood as the bulwark of American-Japanese international cooperation. It is today every bit the linchpin of regional stability and bilateral cooperation that wise men foresaw years ago. The demise of the Soviet Union may confront us both with ominous dangers, but it also presents us an historic opportunity. The leadership Japan and other Asian nations can provide to help transform a once-totalitarian empire into market-oriented and democratic states helps guarantee the future peace and stability of our world. Let me add that with the changes in the former Soviet Union, the United States sees no reason why Japan should not regain the Northern Territories. We share this goal, and in whatever way we can, we will help you attain it. We cannot imagine meeting the foreign policy challenges of our time without Japan as a partner. That is why today Prime Minister Miyazawa and President Bush will issue a document called the Tokyo Declaration, setting out the basic principles and major challenges of our global partnership. By putting into words the fundamentals of the two great partners, we hope to guide the way through the turbulent waters ahead. We must be clear about our responsibilities and our requirements, for our renewed alliance will do much to define the shape of the post-cold-war world.

We welcome the work of the Center for Global Partnership in expanding exchanges and interactions, intellectual, scientific, and cultural. Thanks to such programs, our two nations will have an ever-increasing number of people who have lived in each other's country, speak each other's language, and understand more fully how important we are to each other. Although more than 200,000 Asian students now study in American colleges and universities, more Americans must immerse themselves in Asian societies and cultures. As the exchange of free people and ideas flows between our nations and as the cold war ends in victory for our cause, our economic relations have taken center stage. This brings me to the fourth and most important point. If we are to expand our economic ties, we must face up to the economic tensions that threaten our relations. We must reduce those tensions now by opening markets and by eliminating barriers to trade and investment. Japan will sell about $90 billion worth of goods and services to the United States this year. We will sell nearly $50 billion to Japan. Isolation and protectionism must remain the sleeping ghosts of the past, not the waking nightmares of the future. We must reject these failed notions in the sure knowledge that expanding markets mean expanding jobs and increasing prosperity for both our countries. We must ensure a continued strong two-way economic relationship between Japan and the United States, with markets more open to new goods and services, manufacturers more open to new competitive ideas, the financial services industry competing on a fair basis, and an equitable flow of technology on both sides. Our two countries share a special responsibility to strengthen the world economy. Yesterday the President and the Prime Minister announced a strategy for world growth which commits both our countries to domestic policies to stimulate growth. Expanded domestic demand in Japan translates into additional exports to Japan for American products and jobs at home. And we are seeking broad support for growth policies among other industrialized countries as well. Many American businesses learned during the past decade that the old ways no longer work in our changing international marketplace. Our companies have cut costs, improved quality, and championed innovation. As a result, our products sell in markets everywhere they have access. And candidly, such access is still limited in Japan. We must reduce the trade imbalance between us, not through managed trade, through gimmicks or artificial devices, but simply by gaining true and welcome access to your markets.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstextremarksthejapanesewelcomingcommitteeluncheontokyo", "title": "Text of Remarks at the Japanese Welcoming Committee Luncheon in Tokyo", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/text-remarks-the-japanese-welcoming-committee-luncheon-tokyo", "publication_date": "09-01-1992", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}

American business does not need a handout and does not want one. Some say that perhaps it is time to help the United States out of a sense of pity or compassion. Let me tell you, we are looking for no such help. What the United States wants from Japan is for Japan to recognize its international economic responsibility for its own sake and for the sake of the global marketplace upon which Japan depends. When we express appreciation to those who seek to open Japanese markets, it is not because we need a handout but because we know an open Japan is good for us all. Our companies simply expect the chance to compete fairly in markets around the world. Our Government remains committed to open markets, and we will further reduce our own trade barriers as our friends dismantle their own. Our two countries have embarked on a unique experiment in economic independence called the Structural Impediments Initiative. In this effort, each side pinpoints the other's barriers to competitiveness, and each commits to reduce them. We both must reinvigorate this commitment to market access, whether for high quality American products or quality American services. The beneficiaries will be the workers and consumers on both sides of the Pacific. It means greater openness in many sectors of the Japanese economy still biased against outside investment. These practices hurt American companies, but they also hurt Japanese consumers. Americans want the same things you want, a better quality of life for themselves and their families. Americans never say, Please raise our prices. Every worker is also a consumer, and economic competition brings them great choices and lower prices. In fact, the Toys-R-Us store that the President visited in Kyoto offers prices up to 30 percent lower than its Japanese competition. The stunning success of the consumers' response to its sister store north of Tokyo tells the same story. That is good for us, and it is good for you. We sold more exports last year than ever before. We enjoy a trade surplus with Europe. About one-third of our economic growth between 1985 and 1990 was attributable to merchandise exports. To Japan, our manufactured exports are up 70 percent since 1987, a $20 billion increase that represents almost half a million jobs. Still the overall trade deficit with Japan remains large.

As you know, the United States and Japan also face the urgent challenge of leading the way to a successful conclusion of the Uruguay round. Because of the benefits we each derive from free trade, Japan and the United States bear a special responsibility for tackling the remaining difficult issues quickly and decisively. The success of the round depends on bold, farsighted leadership. We must lift our gaze to the glimmering horizon of broader prosperity and not worry over the stones in our immediate path. Yes, all of us have problems with portions of the so-called Dunkel draft, but we cannot let the progress it represents slip through our fingers. If we allow that draft to be picked apart by special interests, who wins? The GATT round is the world's best hope for expanding trade for all countries. They believe very, very strongly in creating a level playing field for everyone. We want all our trading partners to give the United States companies the same kind of opportunities that their firms enjoy in the United States. And it creates a basis for even greater freedom and greater prosperity for all. Many of our Japanese friends argue that the United States must improve its competitiveness, and they are right. We recognize that some of our bilateral trade imbalance stems from causes other than restricted market access. One reason for Japan's competitiveness is because Japan has saved and invested at a rate double that of the United States. You have focused on applied research and development and new manufacturing technologies. Your companies have established fine quality control systems. You have developed a highly educated labor force and have taken the long view to develop markets abroad. There is much for us to learn from you. We are taking steps to boost our competitiveness. We can and will increase our rate of savings and investment. We will continue to boost our manufacturing's excellence. We will reduce the budget deficit. To stimulate innovation, risk, and longer term business outlook, the President is pushing for investment incentives, R&D credits, and capital gains tax cuts. It would be easier if our politicians saw the positive effect on Japan's competitiveness due to low capital gains rates. And America must raise its educational standards. Our America 2000 education strategy will fuel a revolution for better quality schools. This is another path to competitiveness.

Every one of them can tell you that despite the fact that our economy is facing some new tough times right now, America still draws upon tremendous strengths. We have many of the world's finest universities. American technology remains on the cutting edge in many advanced fields such as computers and biotechnology. It has the added advantage of drawing upon the strengths and insights of many cultures, including Japan's. The chief executive officers accompanying the President will also tell you that they care about American jobs. They care about American exports. We know that the Asian-Pacific market offers enormous potential to those American businesses that will accept the challenge of competition. That same competition has propelled Japan toward world leadership. Open markets around the world has provided Japan with economic prominence. Japan must now join the ranks of world leadership in strengthening free markets and freedom. Finally, let me leave with you a message that the President wished to give directly to the people of Japan. fairness, trust, and respect. We expect nothing less, and we ask for nothing more.

I, too, want to pay tribute to Margaret Heckler and Elizabeth Holtzman for their vision in creating this office, for the leadership that thank you for the past leadership of Olympia Snowe and Pat Schroeder, Connie Morella and Nita Lowey. And of course, to Nancy Johnson and Eleanor Holmes Norton, who show no lack of energy in pressing your cause with the President. That is about 52 too few. And I was thinking it, too, based on your record. I think the thing that has been overlooked in this whole endeavor of trying to give more sensitivity to issues of special concern to women and trying to give women more opportunities to serve is that we live in an age where every public figure says, as if it were just a cliche, that the most important resource in any human endeavor in the private sector or the public sector is our people. And yet we cavalierly go on, in example after example after example, not giving all our people the chance to live up to the fullest of their God-given capacities and make the greatest service they can to the rest of us to promote the general welfare. I have done what I could to correct that, partly based on the example of my wife, my mother, and my grandmother, and partly because I have known so many of you personally, and partly because it is manifest that we have to find a way to reach across all the lines in our society and lift up everyone to the position of his or her highest and best use and potential.

So, the country is in your debt. And I do believe that the bipartisan nature of this caucus has made a profound difference. I know that we are joined tonight by the Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt, and I believe Speaker Gingrich wanted to be here and had to be in Georgia tonight. I know Mr. Gephardt would agree with me that all of us have been impressed by how you are able to stay together, work together, and, in Eleanor's terms, get down to business no matter how crazy things get in this occasionally loony town. And for that, too, we are all in your debt, for you set an example that everyone else should follow. I'd like to talk just a moment about health issues. Hillary mentioned them and has worked on them so hard, and others have mentioned them. The budget not only provided for $24 billion to extend health coverage to 5 million children who do not have it, thus giving greater peace of mind to the parents who are raising them, both as parents and also when they are away at work, it did a lot more for the health of women. It expanded Medicare to cover bone mass measurement for women at risk of osteoporosis. Funding for osteoporosis research has now reached more than $100 million at NIH. It expanded Medicare to cover annual mammograms for all women over the age of 49 and eliminated the copayments to make these examinations more affordable. These were important things, and we have more to do. We have to continue our focus on women's health. Since I took office, funding for breast cancer research, prevention, and treatment has almost doubled, and we have discovered two breast cancer genes, holding great promise for the development of new prevention strategies, something that is profoundly important to all of us who have ever dealt with this in our families. We are unlocking the mysteries of the genetic code and continuing to discover new ways to diagnose and treat genetic disorders.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthecongressionalcaucusforwomensissues", "title": "Remarks to the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-congressional-caucus-for-womens-issues", "publication_date": "21-10-1997", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 6018, "text": "But we know that these breakthroughs also bring with them the need for new protections. Studies show the leading reason women do not take advantage of new genetic breast cancer tests is because they fear they will be discriminated in health plans if the tests come out the wrong way. So I want to work with you to get Congress to pass bipartisan legislation that will ban all health plans, group and individual, from denying coverage or raising premiums on the basis of genetic tests. After all, if we can get everybody to take the tests, if they know what they are up against, in the end we will prevent more severe illness, we will reduce cost to the health care system. And we should not punish individuals for doing something that we know is not only in their own interest but is in the interest of society. Also, legislation should prohibit all health plans from disclosing genetic information that could be misused by other insurers. It ought to protect researchers' ability to make the best use of this important tool. So, again, let me applaud those, especially Representative Slaughter and Senator Snowe, for their leadership. Genetic discrimination legislation deserves action now. Let me also say that many of you in this room have contributed to our efforts to support legislation to protect women who have had mastectomies. They should not be forced out of the hospital before they are ready because of pressure from a health plan. It is unacceptable that Congress has not yet held a hearing on the DeLauro-Dingell-Roukema 48-hour mastectomy patient protection bill, and we need to keep pushing for that. And finally, we need to keep breaking down the doors and breaking through the glass ceilings and acting to bring women the full measure of economic and legal equity to which they are entitled. This caucus and our administration, under the leadership of Aida Alvarez, continues to work to counter the effects of discrimination and long-developed networks which hinder the success of women- and minority-owned businesses. I am proud of the fact that the SBA in the last 5 years has tripled the number of loans to women businesses, and I thank you for your support of the disadvantaged business enterprise program, which has successfully increased the percentage of women- and minority-owned construction firms.

But the major reason we need to reform the campaign finance system, in my judgment, is that it is almost all the money goes to voter communication, and it is wrong to have unequal levels of voter communication. The people need to hear a full debate on both sides and have a full ability to evaluate the personalities of candidates on all sides in order to make good decisions. And the second main reason we need it is that the people in office and the people who want to get in office have to spend too much time raising money, and they are exhausted all the time, and they do not have enough time to read and think and talk to other people. I would say the third reason you need it is the reason all the press says, which is, you know, the corrupting influence of big money. The truth is that over 90 percent of the time way over 90 percent of the time the people in both parties in the Senate and in the House vote their convictions. And way over 90 percent of the time the people that give you money never ask you for anything, except to keep in touch with them and discuss the issues and talk about things and listen to them if they have got something on their minds.

But we have now had we have got an ongoing debate here about what kind of country we are going to be, what our responsibilities to each other are, and where we are going. Now, I know this man very well, Carnahan. I know him very well. We worked together for years. I went to Missouri more than any other State when we were promoting welfare reform because he did the best job of any Governor in America in requiring people who were able-bodied to get training and to go into the workplace and getting big businesses to help him, but also caring about the welfare of poor people, to make sure that the children had health care and the people had a decent place to live and the child care was there and the transportation was there. He did it right. And if he is in the Senate, he will do it right. I can also tell you that for Democrats, because we believe in activist Government, it is very important that we keep a certain number of innovative Governors coming into the U.S. Senate all the time, because they understand how this stuff works.

It is been wonderful to have you here, and I thank you all for coming. I'd like to just add something here. You know, about 135 years ago a Frenchman came to this country because this country had already become the great economic powerhouse that it has continued to be. His name was Alexis de Tocqueville, and he toured all over this country, as he said, looking for the secret of our greatness. And he told some wonderful things. We are pretty unique in all the world with things like you, yourselves, are doing volunteer programs where people set out to help others, to help their neighbors. And he described it as how, he said, a man would see a problem, and he would not call the Government. He'd cross the street and talk to a friend, and pretty soon a committee would be formed. And, he said, they would solve the problem. And then in his book to his own countrymen in France, he said, and you will not believe this, but there would not be a bureaucracy involved at any time in solving that problem. But he found the secret of America, and he also put this in his book. He said he had looked in the busy harbors; he'd looked in our industrial cities; he'd looked all over for the secret of our greatness. And then he said he looked in our churches, and he heard our pulpits aflame with righteousness. Well, I have taken more than my time here because I have got to get in Marine One out there on the South Lawn in just a few minutes and head off for New Hampshire with some of our people and talk to the people up there. And you are all invited to go on over there and you girls, it will kind of blow your hairdos a little bit when we take off. We will shortly be taking off in Marine One, as it is called, out to get on Air Force One.

They came here in the snows of winter over a trail marked with the blood of their rag-bound feet. The iron forge that gave this place its name had been destroyed by the British when General Washington and his ragged Continental ENTITY encamped here exhausted, outnumbered, and short of everything except faith. We gather here today, the 200th anniversary of our independence, to commemorate their sacrifices even before we celebrate the glorious Declaration. Americans will remember the name of Valley Forge as long as the spirit of sacrifice lives within their hearts. Here the vein of iron in our national character was forged. In the 18th century the colonial American was far more free and far more prosperous than his European cousin. Englishmen regarded us with some envy as appropriate subjects to share their grinding tax burdens. After Concord Bridge and Breed's Hill, the British generals were impressed with our marksmanship and fighting spirit, but they still dismissed Washington's militiamen as a rabble of arms. Many years later, when he was 91, a veteran of Concord was interviewed and asked why he took up his rifle against his King. Well, then, what did all the fighting mean? We had always governed ourselves, and we always meant to. Without Jefferson's eloquence, those are the words of the American people's Declaration of Independence. That was the straight talk that brought some 11,000 ordinary Americans farmers, workers, tradesmen, and shopkeepers-into this valley of sacrifice in the bitter winter of 1777. They did not die amid the banners and the fearful sounds of battle. They weakened slowly and quietly succumbed to cold, sickness, and starvation. Yet their courage and suffering those who survived as well as those who fell-were no less meaningful than the sacrifices of those who manned the battlements of Boston and scaled the parapets of Yorktown. In the battle against despair, Washington and his men kept freedom's lonely vigil. The leader and the led drew strength and hope from one another. Around the winter campfires that dotted these fields, the flame of liberty was somehow kept burning. Something happened at Valley Forge. That ragged, starving ENTITY here emerged and changed in a way that can be sensed but never fully described. They suffered, they trained, they toughened, they buried their dead, and they stayed. They stuck it out.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksvalleyforgepennsylvania", "title": "Remarks in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-valley-forge-pennsylvania", "publication_date": "04-07-1976", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Gerald R.

As Abraham Lincoln noted long afterwards at another sacred site in Pennsylvania, nothing we can say here today can further consecrate or hallow this ground. But we can rededicate ourselves to the spirit of sacrifice shown at Valley Forge, Gettysburg, the Argonne Forest, Anzio Beach, and Iwo Jima. Not all sacrifices are made in war. The sturdy wagon trains that have returned here, the wonderful people who drove them, and those along the way who rededicated themselves to the great principles of the Declaration of Independence offer heartwarming proof that our American adventure has just begun. Our Bicentennial is the happy birthday of all 50 States, a commonwealth, and self-governing territories. It is not just a celebration for the original Thirteen Colonies. Americans are one people, and we can still hear them saying, We have always governed ourselves, and we always mean to. The earliest English settlers carried the Bible and Blackstone's Commentary across the Atlantic among their few cherished possessions and established their own stir-governments on a strange and hostile coast. American families in prairie schooners like these took with them on the overland trails the principles of equality and the God-given rights of the Declaration of Independence. Their restless search for a better life was begun in the spirit of adventure, but it was the spirit of sacrifice that sustained them. They suffered cruel winters, savage attacks, blazing deserts, and bloody feet. Many were buried beside the trail, but many stuck it out, dug in, and built permanent settlements where women stood the same sentry duty as the men. In the West, the Declaration's promise of legal and political equality for women was first broadened. The American pioneers knew that in their wilderness homes they could not be colonials ruled by a distant government. They had assurance that in due course they could govern themselves as full citizens of equal States. Their children and future generations would have all the rights of Washington, Jackson, and Lincoln. Though prosperity is a good thing, though compassionate charity is a good thing, though institutional reform is a good thing, a nation survives only so long as the spirit of sacrifice and self-discipline is strong within its people.

And these past few weeks, I guess we broke the record here for the length of a hot spell just a few days ago, before the reduction in temperature, and it reminded me when I was a kid of our minister one hot summer Sunday morning. And he said that he was going to keep his sermon short, and he didjust seven words. Well, today I will follow his example, though I may slip a few more in than seven. But I am sure you have heard of our plan to overhaul the Federal tax program. This is the most burning issue that is facing the American people, I think, in this decade. I am going to be out on the stump all fall bringing our case for tax fairness and economic growth to the American people and rallying their support. I will be in many of your States; indeed, in many of your communities. And I will be looking for your help, because it is the grassroots level that our tax proposal will find the energy, determination, and willpower needed to topple the status quo. Status quothat's Latin for the mess we are in. As State legislators, you do not need to hear about the pleadings of lobbyists, and the siren songs of special interests are heard in every legislative hall from Capitol Hill out through all the 50 States. But this time we can work for the special interests of all the American people to create a fair and equitable tax system, one which will be a double boon to the economy because it'll both close wasteful loopholes and, at the same time, cut tax rates. It is time for Americans to take their money out of tax shelters and invest the money in America's future. Every day we live with the present tax code, we are slowing down economic growth, sacrificing jobs that would have been created, unfairly burdening families, and perpetuating an unjust system that only breeds cynicism and resentment in the American people.

And one of our proudest accomplishments as Republicans is the way we have been able to draw more and more young people into our ranks. We have swept aside the pessimism and resignation that gripped the elected leadership of this country not too long ago, and we have opened our doors to the future. Like the American people themselves, we Republicans believe that America is still young, still vital, and still strong. What we have accomplished together goes beyond words. We have backed our words with decisive and dramatic action. Our 25-percent across-the-board tax reduction gave new life and sustenance to a spirit of optimism. An entrepreneurial renaissance is spreading across our land. A powerful economic expansion is lifting America out of the devastation of a decade of high tax policies and enabling us to build on a solid base of noninflationary growth. Here is a piece of especially good news. The Democratically controlled House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families rated all the different tax plans that are presently floating around up there on the Hill and found that ours was by far the most profamily of all of the tax proposals. By raising the standard deduction to $4,000 for a married couple filing jointly and nearly doubling the personal exemption to $2,000, we will make it so that a family of four does not pay one penny in Federal income tax on the first $12,000 of earnings. We are also giving nonwage-earning spouses equal access to IRA's, those tax deductible savings accounts. But alongside the pension reform passed in the last Congress, this will go a long way toward alleviating poverty by allowing women the means to care for themselves in retirement years. Another report may be of special interest to you as State legislators. Our proposal to eliminate the State and local tax deduction has been getting a lot of flack from some quarters. Well, it turns out that the New York State government has a study by its own comptroller. It found that under our proposal, taxpayers in New York would save $588 million a year.

Of course, we still have a job to do in Congress getting spending under control. In that regard, on the revenue side, I'd like it known that I could immediately deposit $1.2 billion in cash in the Treasury if Congress will support this administration's decision to sell Conrail back to the private sector, where it belongs. I was only a small boy the first time the Federal Government tried to run the railroads. That was during World War I, and it was a disaster. So, we have an offer of that amount already. We can sell, if they will only give the word. As Everett Dirksen might have said, A billion here and a billion there and pretty soon you are talking real money. Some in Congress seem to think they can proceed as usual, indiscriminately spending taxpayer dollars, and that sooner or later they will all be bailed out with a tax hike. Well, for at least 31/2 years they will not . We Republicans have always looked for the long-range solutions, and this tax plan is one of those which will be working long after we have left office. As State legislators, you know that programs closer to home are more cost-efficient, better planned, and offer more assistance. But the gluttonous Federal tax system has robbed you of the base for local programs. We must continue to move this wheel of government in the interest of what is right for America.

And I think last week we saw an extraordinary example of cooperation between the legislative and executive branches of government, and I want all of you Members of the House to know how deeply grateful I am for what you did last week. During these past 112 days we have worked well together, and I think we have made a little history. Thanks to you, we have made it clear that spending can be controlled and that our system works. The voice of the people can be heard here in the Capital, and in so doing, we have restored their confidence of our people in their government and in the institutions of this Government. I know that what we did was only the first step, but I have confidence that in the weeks and months ahead we will continue to put country ahead of partisanship. Yes, we have a big job ahead of us putting tax cuts into effect that are really the other half of returning America's prosperity. I believe the reduction in the tax rates, as I know I have said to many of you, is essential to restoring the spirit of enterprise. You know, some years ago there was an economist at Harvard, now deceased, Sumner Schlichter. And he said once that if a visitor from Mars came to Earth, he would conclude that our tax policy had been created to make private enterprise unworkable. And, you know, maybe what he was talking about, sometimes in a business or a sports team or an army, will outperform its competitor even though the material assets of the two seem to be roughly equal. Now, some academicians have commented-well, they have referred to this as the x factor in human affairs, a confidence or a spirit that makes men and women dream and dare and take greater risks. Well, for too long a time our tax structure has stifled that x factor and that spirit of confidence and daring in our economic doings here in our land.

We have witnessed the magic moment when an intricate mass of steel and cable and sophisticated marvels of engineering suddenly become a living thing with a unique personality. No matter how many commissionings you take part in, breaking the pennant and setting the first watch involves a special reward for all of us who love the sea and the United States Navy. I thank you very much, Captain Compton, and all of the ship's company for the privilege of being here.

Their allegiance and their service to the country is also in the very best tradition of this great Nation. We all regret that Mrs. Chester W. Nimitz, St., cannot share this proud hour with all of us, but I am happy that Mrs. Lay and other members of the admiral's family are here. It is also gratifying to have Admiral Rickover here, for without these two farsighted submariners, Fleet Admiral Nimitz and Admiral Rickover, we would have no nuclear Navy. Few of us remember that it was Admiral Nimitz, as he was completing his career as Chief of Naval Operations in 1947, who recommended to the then Secretary of the Navy that the Bureau of Ships and the new Atomic Energy Commission get together to design and to build a nuclear propulsion plant for a submarine. Admiral Rickover took it from there. I see this great ship as a double symbol of today's challenging times. She is first of all a symbol of the United States, of our immense resources in materials and skilled manpower, of our inexhaustible energy, of the inventive and productive genius of our free, competitive economic system, and of our massive but controlled military strength.

Whether her mission is one of defense, diplomacy, or humanity, the Nimitz will command awe and admiration from some, caution and circumspection from others, and respect from all. There is no need for me to dwell on the importance of aircraft carriers in today's and tomorrow's defense planning though as an old carrier man myself, I might like that role. During recent days, I think it is worthy to note, we have seen the most convincing demonstration of their readiness and their flexibility in the successful execution of national policy. Without the five aircraft carriers which served as the nucleus of our forces operating off South Vietnam, without the skill and the heroic performance of Marine Corps and naval aviation and support personnel, without the Air Force helicopter crews who operated from the carrier decks, we could not have rescued all of the remaining American citizens and thousands of endangered Vietnamese from Saigon within 20 hours. And I congratulate, on behalf of all of you, the work that was done on that occasion. The Nimitz joins the fleet at an auspicious moment when our determination to strengthen our tics with allies across both great oceans and to work for peace and stability around the world requires clear demonstration. Along with our other forces worldwide, the Nimitz will make critically important contributions in our continuing quest for a peaceful planet, a planet whose surface is more than 70 percent ocean. As I see the United States Ship Nimitz as a symbol of the vast power, the protective or productive skill and economic strength of America, so will others around the world. To all, this great ship is visible evidence of our commitment to friends and allies and our capability to maintain those commitments. But for Americans, especially, she is also a symbol of the man whose name she bears. The grandson of a seafaring German immigrant, who grew up in the great State of Texas and never lost his pride in his native State, Chester W. Nimitz started from the smoke of Pearl Harbor and carried the fight to the enemy. His superb leadership and the valor of more than 2 million American fighting men culminated on the deck of the U.S.S.

As a lowly lieutenant on the U.S.S. Monterey, a carrier you could probably stow on the hangar deck of the Nimitz, I saw very little of fleet admirals during World War II. But every watch officer could recognize the crisp CINCPAC dispatches that Admiral Nimitz obviously had written in his own hand. One biographer who did not know him or who, I should say, did know him Professor E. B. Potter of the Naval Academy, summed up Admiral Nimitz' qualities in simple words that well serve as a model for anyone who aspires to leadership in any line of endeavor. He surrounded himself with the ablest men he could find and sought their advice, but he made his own decisions. He was a keen strategist who never forgot that he was dealing with human beings, on both sides of the conflict. He was aggressive in war without hate, audacious while never failing to weigh the risks. Admiral Nimitz, of all the great American commanders of World War II, was one of the most self-effacing and, certainly, one of the most effective. He possessed great stamina, an abundance of common sense, and such immense inner strength that he felt no need to strut or to shout. Born near what today we would call the poverty level, he worked hard, he studied hard, and was a long, long time getting ahead. He spent his whole life training to serve his country in commanding men at sea, and when he was needed, he was prepared. He learned by his mistakes and was tolerant of others, but he was always in command. Those who had the good fortune to know Admiral Nimitz will say his fundamental honesty, intellectual honesty and integrity, enabled him to keep a steady course toward his ultimate objective without yielding to the tremendous pressures of his vast responsibilities. He did the job he was prepared to do, did it superbly, hung up his sword and filled his final years with quiet service to his country and to the cause of peace. Repeatedly urged to write his wartime memoirs, Admiral Nimitz just as repeatedly refused. To do so, he explained, would compel him either to hurt the reputations of some fine shipmates or tell some whopping lies.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheussnimitzcommissioningceremonynorfolkvirginia", "title": "Remarks at the U.S.S.

But we now know that the security threats we will face in the future, rooted in terrorism and organized crime and drug trafficking, are closely tied to things the military has had to work on for years, trying to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, stand up to rogue states, and protect our security interests around the world. We are going to have to fight on all these fronts, and you are going to have to continue to be the best trained, best equipped, best motivated, most flexible military in the world for us to succeed. I am committed to making sure that you always are that and to doing whatever we have to do to improve the quality of life and the conditions of living, so that the best people in America want to be in the military and want to stay in the military. Since I have been President, I have twice had to go back to Congress to ask for large appropriations totaling over $35 billion to help to maintain our training, our readiness, and our quality of life. And this year I asked the Congress for a supplemental appropriation to cover contingencies in the Defense Department so we could fund a pay increase at the maximum legal level allowable and continue to make improvements in readiness and the quality of life. We are going to continue to do that. If you are committed to serving America, the people who make the decisions about investments in your future should be committed to making sure that you can serve and succeed, that you can have good families and a good life in the United States military. And we are very grateful to you for that. Let me say, what I most wanted to do was to have a chance to say thank you personally and to go down the row and shake hands with the children.

{"id": 6036, "text": "Scotty Campbell and fellow Government employees, it is a pleasure to be with you. Also, I hope all of us have long years of service in the future in Washington. I have just come back from a very fine visit to New Jersey to see a new steelplant that is exciting for an engineer and a President to observe. This is the most modern steelplant in the world. Each employee produces 1,340 tons of steel per year, including all the executive management. This is the highest productivity per steelworker in the world. They use 30 percent as much energy as the former steelplants used. They make steelrod of the highest quality, and 50 percent of it, you might be interested in knowing, is sold at this time to the People's Republic of China, successfully competing in price half the world away with the Japanese steelplants that are much closer. The dynamism and competence of our own Nation and its free enterprise system, in my judgment, is equaled by the dynamism and confidence and the competence of the public servants like you, who represent the American people in our Federal Government. I came to the Presidency determined to make my own administration and the Government in general more responsive to the American public and at the same time more efficient in the delivery of services to those who look to us for leadership and for service. Since taking office, I have seen repeatedly that the key to the more effective Government, which we all desire, has been our creation of a more productive, more dynamic, and more cost-conscious Federal workforce. In 1978, with the help of many of you assembled here, I was able to sign into law a bill which completely overhauled the civil service system of the Federal Government for the first time in a hundred years. It was Scotty Campbell's concept, which the Congress courageously passed for my signature. It was one of the most significant achievements of my own administration. The Civil Service Reform Act gives Federal managers, like many of you, some of the same management incentives that have proved so effectively to make our private economy and its free enterprise system competitive and the pride of the entire world. It emphasizes performance, not just longevity. It lets us select individual public servants and reward them, and thereby in a positive way encourage others to excel. Today's ceremony is unprecedented, and it is also long overdue, in my judgment. Too often we single out Federal managers only when there is been a problem.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocuments1980presidentialrankawardsfortheseniorexecutiveserviceremarkstheawardsceremony", "title": "1980 Presidential Rank Awards for the Senior Executive Service Remarks at the Awards Ceremony", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/1980-presidential-rank-awards-for-the-senior-executive-service-remarks-the-awards-ceremony", "publication_date": "09-09-1980", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Jimmy Carter"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Federal managers exert an enormous influence on us all. Your responsibilities are often staggering in their scope and complexity and difficulty. Some of you are the most important executives in America. Where we find excellence, we need to acknowledge and reward that 'excellence publicly. I am pleased to be present today for this distinguished executive awards ceremony to 49 men and women who've served our Nation so well. Let me say that your service to our country has been truly distinguished. You are the best of the Government's senior executives; in my opinion the best of the best. I know that the awards have already been issued to you, but I'd like to name just a few that have come to my attention personally and, I think, are representative of the entire group's achievements. Harold Denton of the NRC has won wide praise for his performance following the Three Mile Island accident. I talked to Harold just a few hours after this accident occurred. When I went to the Three Mile Island plant the Sunday following the accident I went into the control room with Harold, and from then on I saw on television every night his calm, professional, reassuring voice letting the American people know that they need have no fear. Chris Kraft of NASA made space travel the safest transportation in the world. He has directed, as you know, and was principal organizer of the Mission Control Center in Houston of Mercury, Gemini, and the Apollo space missions, one of the most notable technological achievements in history. Claude Farinha saved the United States Air Force $28 million through better logistics management, an achievement which would ordinarily not go recognized to the American people. I am sure that Scotty Campbell has already recognized individually what you all have accomplished. But on behalf of 240 million Americans, I want to say from the bottom of my heart, as ENTITY, thank you for what you have meant to our country. These awards today are a solid investment for our country. The millions of dollars that you 49 people have saved, saved the taxpayer, could fund the senior executive bonuses for many decades in the future, even generations. In honoring you I hope to encourage others, all public servants, to higher levels of accomplishment. And I also want to make your excellence known to your employers, the people of America.

I echo the wish of the governor that it might be our privilege to stay a long time in Idaho and know something more than her fame, know her people, come in contact with her industries, and see the things that we have all so long read about and admired from a distance; but, unfortunately, it is necessary for us to go back to Washington as soon as we can, though it was a great pleasure to escape from Washington. The people of the United States do not live there, and in order to know what the people of the United States are thinking about and talking about it is necessary to come and find out for yourself. I have taken pains since I was a boy so to saturate myself in the traditions of America that I generally feel a good deal of confidence that the impulses which I find in myself are American impulses; but no matter how thoroughly American a man may be, he needs constantly to renew his touch with all parts of America and to be sure that his mind is guided, if he be in public station, by the thoughts and purposes of his fellow countrymen. It was, therefore, with the most earnest desire to get in touch with you and the rest of my fellow countrymen that I undertook this trip, for, my fellow countrymen, we are facing a decision now in which we can not afford to make a mistake. We must not let ourselves be deceived as to the gravity of that decision or as to the implications of that decision. It will mean a great deal now, but it will mean infinitely more in the future. America has to do at this moment nothing less than prove to the world whether she has meant what she said in the past. I must confess that I have been amazed that there are some men in responsible positions who are opposed to the ratification of the treaty of peace altogether. It is natural that so great a document, full of so many particular provisions, should draw criticism upon itself for this, that, or the other provision.

Do not let your thoughts dwell too constantly upon Germany. Germany attempted this outrageous thing, but Germany was not the only country that had ever entertained the purpose of subjecting the peoples of the world to its will, and when we went into this war we said that we sent our soldiers across the seas not because we thought this was an American fight in particular, but because we knew that the purpose of Germany was against liberty, and that where anybody was fighting liberty it was our duty to go into the contest. We set this Nation up with the profession that we wanted to set an example of liberty not only, but to lead the world in the paths of liberty and justice and of right; and at last, after long reflection, after long hesitation, after trying to persuade ourselves that this was a European war and nothing more, we suddenly looked our own consciences in the face and said, This is not merely a European war. This is a war which imperils the very principles for which this Government was set up, and it is our duty to lend all the force that we have, whether of men or of resources, to the resistance of these designs. And it was America never let anybody forget this it was America that saved the world, and those who propose the rejection of the treaty propose that, after having redeemed the world, we should desert the world. The settlements of this treaty can not be maintained without the concerted action of all the great Governments of the world. I asked you just now not to think exclusively about Germany, but turn your thoughts back to what it was that Germany proposed. Germany did direct her first force against France and against Belgium, but you know that it was not her purpose to remain in France, though it was part of her purpose to remain in Belgium.

That was her plan; and what does the treaty of peace do? For I want you to remember, my fellow countrymen, that this treaty is not going to stand by itself. The treaty with Austria has now been signed; it will presently be sent over, and I shall lay that before the Senate of the United States. It will be laid down along exactly the same lines as the treaty with Germany; and the lines of the treaty with Germany suggest this, that we are setting up the very States which Germany and Austria intended to dominate as independent, self-governing units. We are giving them what they never could have got with their own strength, what they could have got only by the united strength of the armies of the world . We have given them what I have called their land titles. We have said, These lands that others have tried to dominate and exploit for their own uses belong to you, and we assign them to you in fee simple. They never did belong to anybody else. It was brigandage to take them. We give them to you in fee simple. But what is the use of setting up the titles if we do not guarantee them? And that guaranty is the only guaranty against the repetition of the war we have gone through just so soon as the German nation, 60,000,000 strong, can again recover its strength and its spirit, for east of Germany lies the fertile field of intrigue and power. At this moment the only people who are dealing with the Bolshevist government in Russia are the Germans. They are fraternizing with the few who exercise control in that distracted country.

Off here in this beloved continent, with its great free stretches and its great free people, we have not realized the cloud of dread and terror under which the people of Europe have lived.

Not under the. delusion that we would seek in any direct or conscious way to serve Germany, but with the knowledge that the guaranties will not be sufficient without America, and that, inasmuch as Germany is out of the arrangement, it will be very useful to Germany to have America out of the arrangement. Germany knows that if America is out of the arrangement America will lose the confidence and cooperation of all the other nations in the world, and, fearing America's strength, she wants to see America alienated from the peoples from whom she has been alienated. She wants to see one great nation left out of this combination which she never would again dare face.

Every member of the league, and that will mean every fighting nation in the world except Germany, agrees that it will never go to war without first having done one or the other of two things either having submitted the matter in dispute to arbitration, in which case it agrees absolutely to abide by the result, or having submitted it to consideration by the council of the league of nations, in which case it promises to lay all the documents, all the facts, in its possession before the council and to give the council six months in which to consider the matter, and, if it does not like the opinion of the council at the end of the six months, still to wait three months more before it resorts to arms. That is what America has been striving for. That is what the Congress of the United States directed me to bring about. Perhaps you do not know where; it was in an unexpected place, in the naval appropriations bill. Congress, authorizing a great building program of ships and the expenditure of vast sums of money to make our Navy one of the strongest in the world, paused a moment and declared in the midst of the appropriation bill that it was the policy of the United States to bring about disarmament and that for that purpose it was the policy of the United States to cooperate in the creation of a great international tribunal to which should be submitted questions of international difference and controversy, and it directed the President of the United States, not later than the close of this war, to call together an international conference for that purpose.

The prices the people of this country are paying for everything that it is necessary for them to use in order to live are not justified by a shortage in supply, either present or prospective, and are in many cases artificially and deliberately created by vicious practises which ought immediately be checked by law. They constitute a burden upon us which is the more unbearable because we know that it is wilfully imposed by those who have the power and that it can by vigorous public action be greatly lightened and made to square with the actual conditions of supply and demand. Some of the methods by which these' prices are produced are already illegal, some of them criminal, and those who employ them will be energetically proceeded against ; but others have not yet been brought under the law, and should be dealt with at once by legislation. I need not recite the particulars of this critical matter, the prices demanded and paid at the sources of supply, at the factory, in the food markets, at the shops, in the restaurants and hotels, alike in the city and in the village. They are familiar to you. They are the talk of every domestic circle and of every group of casual acquaintances even. of familiar knowledge, also, that a process has set in which is likely, unless something is done, to push prices and rents and the whole cost of living higher and yet higher, in a vicious cycle to which there is no logical or natural end. With the increase in the prices of the necessaries of life come demands for increase in wages demands which are justified if there be no other means of enabling men to live. Upon the increase of wages there follows close an increase in the price of the products whose producers have been accorded the increase not a proportionate increase, for the manufacturer does not content himself with that but an increase considerably greater that the added wage cost and for which the added wage cost is oftentimes hardly more than an excuse. The laborers who do not get an increase in pay when they demand it are likely to strike, and the strike only makes matters worse.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressthehighcostliving", "title": "Address to Congress On the High Cost of Living", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-the-high-cost-living", "publication_date": "08-08-1919", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Woodrow Wilson"], "gender": ["M"]}}

But what we can do we should do, and should do at once. And there is a great deal that we can do, provisional though it be. Wheat shipments and credits to facilitate the purchase of our wheat can and will be limited and controlled in such a way as not to raise, but rather to lower, the price of flour here. The Government has the power, within certain limits, to regulate that. We cannot deny wheat to foreign peoples who are in dire need of it, and we do not wish to do so; but, fortunately, though the wheat crop is not what we hoped it would be, it is abundant, if handled with provident care. The price of wheat is lower in the United States than in Europe, and can with proper management be kept so. By way of immediate relief, surplus stocks of both food and clothing in the hands of the Government will be sold, and, of course, sold at prices at which there is no profit. And by way of a more permanent correction of prices, surplus stocks in private hands will be drawn out of storage and put upon the market. Fortunately, under the terms of the Food Control act the hoarding of foodstuffs can be checked and prevented; and they will be, with the greatest energy. Foodstuffs can be drawn out of storage and sold by legal action, which the Department of Justice will institute wherever necessary; but so soon as the situation is systematically dealt with, it is not likely that the courts will often have to be resorted to. Much of the accumulating of stocks has no doubt been due to the sort of speculation which always results from an uncertainty. Great surpluses were accumulated because it was impossible to foresee what the market would disclose and dealers were determined to be ready for whatever might happen, as well as eager to reap the full advantage of rising prices. They will now see the disadvantage, as well as the danger, of holding off from the new process of distribution.

The supply of fresh eggs on hand in June of this year, for example, was greater by nearly Jo per cent than the supply on hand at the same time last year, and yet the wholesale price was 40 cents a dozen as against 3o cents a year ago. The stock of frozen fowls had increased more than 298 per cent., and yet the price had risen also from 34 1/2 cents per pound to 37 1/2 cents. The supply of creamery butter had increased 129 per cent., and the price from 41 to 53 cents per pound. The supply of salt beef had been augumented 3 per cent., and the price had gone up from $34 a barrel to $36 a barrel. Canned corn had increased in stock nearly 92 per cent., and had remained substantially the same in price. In a few foodstuffs the prices had declined, but in nothing like the proportion in which the supply had increased. For example, the stock of canned tomatoes had increased 102 per cent., and yet the price had declined only 25 cents per dozen cans. In some cases there had been the usual result of an increase of price following a decrease of supply, but in almost every instance the increase of price had been disproportionate to the decrease in stock. The Attorney General has been making a careful study of the situation as a whole and of the laws that can be applied to better it, and is convinced that, under the stimulation and temptation of exceptional circumstances, combinations of producers and combinations of traders have been formed for the control of supplies and of prices which are clearly in restraint of trade, and against these, prosecutions will be promptly instituted and actively pushed which will in all likelihood have a prompt corrective effect. There is reason to believe that the prices of leather, of coal, of lumber, and of textiles have been materially affected by forms of concert and cooperation among the producers and marketers of these and other universally necessary commodities which it will be possible to redress.

There can be little doubt that retailers are in part sometimes in large part responsible for exorbitant prices; and it is quite practicable for the Government through the agencies I have mentioned to supply the public with full information as 'to the prices at which retailers buy and as to the cost of transportation they pay, in order that it may be known just what margin of profit they, are demanding. Opinion and concerted action on the part of purchasers can probably do the rest. That is, these agencies may perform this indispensable service provided the Congress will supply them with the necessary funds to prosecute their inquiries and keep their price lists up to date. Hitherto the appropriation committee of the Houses have not always, I fear, seen the full value of these inquiries, and the departments and commissions have been very much straitened for means to render this service. That adequate funds be provided by appropriation for this purpose, and provided as promptly as possible, is one of the means of greatly ameliorating the present distressing conditions of livelihood that I have come to urge, in this attempt to concert with you the best ways to serve the country in this emergency. It is one of the absolutely necessary means, underlying many others, and can be supplied at once.

As it stands now, it is limited in operation to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon the formal, proclamation of peace. But I should judge that it was clearly within the constitutional power of the Congress to make similar permanent provisions and regulations with regard to all goods destined for interstate commerce, and to exclude them from interstate shipment if the requirements of law are not complied with. The abuses that have grown up in the manipulation of prices by the withholding of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life cannot otherwise be effectively prevented. May I not call attention to the fact, also, that, although, the present act prohibits profiteering, the prohibition is accompanied by no penalty? It is clearly in the public interest that a penalty should be provided which will be persuasive. To the same end I earnestly recommend, in the second place, that the Congress pass a law regulating cold storage as it is regulated, for example, by the laws of the state of New Jersey, which limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage, prescribe the methods of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period, and require that goods released from storage shall in all cases bear the date of their receipt. It would materially add to the serviceability of the law, for the purpose we now have in view, if it were also prescribed that all goods released from storage for interstate shipment should have plainly marked upon each package the selling or market price at which they went in storage. By this means the purchaser would always be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale dealer. It would serve as a useful example to the other communities of the country, as well as greatly relieve local distress, if the Congress were to regulate all such matters very fully for the District of Columbia, where its legislative authority is without limit. I would also recommend that it be required that all goods destined for interstate commerce should in every case, where their form or package makes it possible, be plainly marked with the price at which they left the hands of the producer.

We should formulate a law requiring a Federal license of all corporations engaged in interstate commerce and embodying in the license, or in the conditions under which it is to be issued, specific regulations designed to secure competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits in the method of marketing. Such a law would afford a welcome opportunity to effect other much needed reforms in the' business of interstate shipment and in the methods of corporations which are engaged in it ; but for the moment I confine my recommendations to the object immediately in hand, which is to lower the cost of living.

The organization that was brought into being on October 24, 1945, represents our greatest advance toward making that dream a reality. The United Nations was born out of an agony of war the most terrible war in history. Those who drew up the charter really had less to do with the creation of the United Nations than the millions who fought and died in that war. We who work to carry out its great principles should always remember that this organization owes its existence to the blood and sacrifice of millions of men and women. It is built out of their hopes for peace and justice. The United Nations represents the idea of a universal morality, superior to the interests of individual nations. Its foundation does not rest upon power or privilege; it rests upon faith. They rest upon the faith of men in human values upon the belief that men in every land hold the same high ideals and strive toward the same goals for peace and justice. This faith is deeply held by the people of the United States of America and, I believe, by the peoples of all other countries. Governments may sometimes falter in their support of the United Nations, but the peoples of the world do not falter. The demand of men and women throughout the world for international order and justice is one of the strongest forces in these troubled times. We have just had a vivid demonstration of that fact in Korea. The invasion of the Republic of Korea was a direct challenge to the principles of the United Nations. That challenge was met by an overwhelming response. The people of almost every member country supported the decision of the Security Council to meet this aggression with force. Few acts in our time have met with such widespread approval. In uniting to crush the aggressors in Korea, these member nations have done no more than the charter calls for. But the important thing is that they have done it, and they have done it successfully. They have given dramatic evidence that the charter works.

They want to be freed from the bondage and the injustice of the past. They want to work out their own destinies. These aspirations of mankind can be met met without conflict and bloodshed by international cooperation through the United Nations. To us in this assembly hall, the United Nations that we see and hear is made up of speeches, debates, and resolutions. But to millions of people, the United Nations is a source of direct help in their everyday lives. To them it is a case of food or a box of schoolbooks; it is a doctor who vaccinates their children; it is an expert who shows them how to raise more rice, or more wheat, on their land; it is the flag which marks a safe haven to the refugee, or an extra meal a day to a nursing mother. These are not the only ways in which the United Nations helps people to help themselves. It goes beyond these material things, it gives support to the spiritual values of men's lives. The United Nations can and does assist people who want to be free. It helps dependent peoples in their progress toward self-government. And when new nations have achieved independence, it helps them to preserve and develop their freedom.

The United Nations has three great roles to play in preventing wars. it provides a way for negotiation and the settlement of disputes among nations by peaceful means. it provides a way of utilizing the collective strength of member nations, under the charter, to prevent aggression. it provides a way through which, once the danger of aggression is reduced, the nations can be relieved of the burden of armaments. All of us must help the United Nations to be effective in performing these functions. The charter obligates all of us to settle our disputes peacefully. Today is an appropriate occasion for us solemnly to reaffirm our obligations under the charter. Within the spirit and even the letter of the charter we shall go even further. We must attempt to find peaceful adjustments of underlying situations or tensions before they harden into actual disputes. The basic issues in the world today affect the fate of millions of people. Here, in the United Nations, there is an opportunity for the large and the small alike to have their voices heard on these issues. Here the interests of every country can be considered in the settlement of problems which are of common concern. We believe that negotiation is an essential part of this peaceful process. The United States, as one of the members of the United Nations, is prepared now, as always, to enter into negotiations.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressnewyorkcitybeforetheunitednationsgeneralassembly", "title": "Address in New York City Before the United Nations General Assembly", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-new-york-city-before-the-united-nations-general-assembly", "publication_date": "24-10-1950", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S.

While we will continue to take advantage of every opportunity here in the United Nations and elsewhere to settle differences by peaceful means, we have learned from hard experience that we cannot rely upon negotiation alone to preserve the peace. Five years ago, after the bloodshed and destruction of World War II, many of us hoped that all nations would work together to make sure that war could never happen again. We hoped that international cooperation, supported by the strength and moral authority of the United Nations, would be sufficient to prevent aggression. Although many countries promptly disbanded their wartime armies, other countries continued to maintain forces so large that they posed a constant threat of aggression. And this year, the invasion of Korea has shown that there are some who will resort to outright war, contrary to the principles of the charter, if it suits their ends. In these circumstances, the United Nations, if it is to be an effective instrument for keeping the peace, has no choice except to use the collective strength of its members to curb aggression. To do so, the United Nations must be prepared to use force. The United Nations did use force to curb aggression in Korea, and by so doing has greatly strengthened the cause of peace. I am glad that additional steps are being taken at this session to prepare for quick and effective action in any future case of aggression.  To maintain the peace, the United Nations must be able to learn the facts about any threat of aggression. Next, it must be able to call quickly upon the member nations to act if the threat becomes serious. Above all, the peace-loving nations must have the military strength available, when called upon, to act decisively to put down aggression. The peace-loving nations are building that strength. However much they may regret the necessity, they will continue to build up their strength until they have created forces strong enough to preserve the peace under the United Nations. They will do all that is required to provide a defense against aggression. They will do that because, under the conditions which now exist in the world, it is the only way to maintain peace. We intend to build up strength for peace as long as it is necessary. But at the same time, we must continue to strive, through the United Nations, to achieve international control of atomic energy and the reduction of armaments and armed forces.

{"id": 6062, "text": "It would be a way of achieving the high purposes of the United Nations without the tremendous expenditures for armaments which conditions in the world today make imperative. Disarmament is the course which the United States would prefer to take. It is the course which most nations would like to adopt. It is the course which the United Nations from its earliest beginnings has been seeking to follow. For nearly 5 years, two commissions of the United Nations have been working on the problem of disarmament. One commission has been concerned with the elimination of atomic weapons and the other with the reduction of other types of armaments and of armed forces. Thus far, these commissions have not been successful in obtaining agreement among all the major powers. Nevertheless, these years of effort have served to bring to the attention of all nations the three basic principles upon which any successful plan of disarmament must rest. First, the plan must include all kinds of weapons. The conflict in Korea bears tragic witness to the fact that aggression, whatever the weapons used, brings frightful destruction. Second, the plan must be based on unanimous agreement. A majority of nations is not enough. No plan of disarmament can work unless it includes every nation having substantial armed forces. One-sided disarmament is a sure invitation to aggression. Disarmament must be based on safeguards which will insure the compliance of all nations. The safeguards must be adequate to give immediate warning of any threatened violation. It must be rounded upon free and open interchange of information across national borders. The task of working out the successive steps would still be a complex one and would take a long time and much effort. But the fact that this process is so complex and so difficult is no reason for us to give up hope of ultimate success. The will of the world for peace is too strong to allow us to give up in this effort. We cannot permit the history of our times to record that we failed by default. We must explore every avenue which offers any chance of bringing success to the activities of the United Nations in this vital area. Much valuable work has already been done by the two disarmament commissions on the different technical problems confronting them. I believe it would be useful to explore ways in which the work of these commissions could now be more closely brought together. One possibility to be considered is whether their work might be revitalized if carried forward in the future through a new and consolidated disarmament commission.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressnewyorkcitybeforetheunitednationsgeneralassembly", "title": "Address in New York City Before the United Nations General Assembly", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-new-york-city-before-the-united-nations-general-assembly", "publication_date": "24-10-1950", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S.

The only course the peace-loving nations can take in the present situation is to create the armaments needed to make the world secure against aggression. That is the course to which the United States is now firmly committed. The United States has embarked upon the course of increasing its armed strength only for the purpose of helping to keep the peace. We pledge that strength to uphold the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that the peace-loving members of the United Nations join us in that pledge. I believe that the United Nations, strengthened by these pledges, will bring us nearer to the peace we seek. We have learned from hard experience that there is no easy road to peace. We have a solemn obligation to the peoples we represent to continue our combined efforts to achieve the strength that will prevent aggression. At the same time, we have an equally solemn obligation to continue our efforts to find solutions to the major problems and issues that divide the nations. The settlement of these differences would make possible a truly dependable and effective system for the reduction and control of armaments. Although the possibility of attaining that goal appears distant today, we must never stop trying. It would free the nations to devote more of their energies to wiping out poverty, hunger, and injustice. If real disarmament were achieved, the nations of the world, acting through the United Nations, could join in a greatly enlarged program of mutual aid. As the cost of maintaining armaments decreased, every nation could greatly increase its contributions to advancing human welfare. All of us could then 'pool even greater resources to support the United Nations in its war against want. In this way, our armaments would be transformed into foods, medicine, tools for use in underdeveloped areas, and into other aids for human advancement. The latest discoveries of science could be made available to men all over the globe. Thus, we could give real meaning to the old promise that swords shall be beaten into plowshares, and that nations shall not learn war any more. Then, man can turn his great inventiveness, his tremendous energies, and the resources with which he has been blessed, to creative efforts. Then we shall be able to realize the kind of world which has been the vision of man for centuries.

It ministers to some great need, it performs some great service, not for itself, but for others; or, failing therein, it ceases to be profitable and ceases to exist. This is the case with the Associated Press. It is one of the eyes of mankind which never slumbers. Without ceasing, it assembles each day the events of each part of the world, and transmits them to every other part. The fundamental reason for this lies in the fact that it is felt to be of vital importance to each man, and each community, to know what other men and other communities are doing. The news is printed and read, not for the mere purpose of entertainment, amusement and recreation, but almost entirely for the practical purpose of information, in order that by means of accurate knowledge of what others are doing a course may be laid out of accurate and successful action. Faith in the American people means a faith in their ability to form sound judgments, when once the facts have been presented to them clearly and without prejudice. It is this educational work, national in its scope, that the Associated Press performs, and upon its integrity and fairness depends in large measure the course of public opinion in the United States. This work is done without any tinge of personal or political opinion. A very practical need exists, and it is met by a very practical service. It is individual in its nature. It is a personal service for each one of us, making its appeal entirely to the intelligence of the individual and recognizing fully the American ideal of intellectual independence. This conception is not exactly at variance with, but certainly supplementary to, the long cherished American ideal of the independence of the individual and the independence of the nation. The work of the Associated Press, both necessary and logical, indicates that the true method would appear to lie in recognizing the broad principle of our individual and national dependence, calculating the requirements which flow from that condition, and governing ourselves accordingly. Complete independence means complete coordination and cooperation. From this principle arises the oft-repeated law of service we can help ourselves only as we help others. A knowledge and an understanding of others become absolutely necessary, in order to make our ideals practical. One of the preeminent requirements of our country at the present time is to reestablish and emphasize in the public mind this law of service.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresstheannualluncheontheassociatedpressnewyorkcity0", "title": "Address to the Annual Luncheon of the Associated Press in New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-annual-luncheon-the-associated-press-new-york-city-0", "publication_date": "22-04-1924", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Calvin Coolidge"], "gender": ["M"]}}

The principle of service is not to be confounded with a weak and impractical sentimentalism. It does not mean that either the individual or the nation is to assume the burdens which ought to be borne by others. It is warranted in considering self to the extent of recognizing that it is justifiable to accumulate and hold the resources which must necessarily be used to serve ourselves, our own household, and our own nation. It recognizes also the necessity of serving others, and when the need arises for meeting a moral requirement, of making individual and national sacrifices sufficient to maintain the cause of righteousness. Some of the recent developments in Washington have revealed the dangers to which I refer in a very dramatic way. Beginning nearly 10 years ago our country entered a period when conditions were altogether artificial and abnormal, culminating in the strained and lurid events of our participation in the war. The old standards of action were either suspended or entirely cast aside. Altogether too many of those in a position to do so began to take advantage of the necessities of the situation for their own profit. Finally nearly all of those in responsible positions throughout the entire civilized world had but one main object in view, which was the winning of the war. They began to make almost every consideration and motive subsidiary to that great effort. Totally inconceivable amounts of money were raised and expended with a lavishness which a few months before would have been believed impossible, and which now seems like some wild nightmare. Notwithstanding the great wave of patriotic fervor which swept over the land; notwithstanding the tremendous sacrifices which the people in every walk of life made, and stood ready to make; almost unconsciously these conditions developed, which I mention not for any purpose now to criticize, where the least scrupulous became the greatest gainers and a considerable part of our population was thrown into a morbid financial state of mind, which even the best intentioned did not wholly escape. The desire for profits and more profits kept on increasing, and the quest for easy money became well-nigh universal. All of this meant an attempt to appropriate the belongings of others without rendering a corresponding service.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresstheannualluncheontheassociatedpressnewyorkcity0", "title": "Address to the Annual Luncheon of the Associated Press in New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-annual-luncheon-the-associated-press-new-york-city-0", "publication_date": "22-04-1924", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Calvin Coolidge"], "gender": ["M"]}}

From all of this sordidness the affairs of government, of course, suffered. In some of it a few public officers were guilty participants. The encouraging thing at present is the evidence of a well-nigh complete return to normal methods of action, and a sane public opinion. The gravity of guilt of this kind is fully realized and publicly reprehended. There is an exceedingly healthy disposition to uproot it altogether, and administer punishment wherever competent evidence of guilt can be produced. That I am doing and propose to continue. Another phase of lingering extravagance, from which the country has not yet fully recovered, is revealed by a consideration of the bills which are pending before the Congress, calling for an expenditure of public money. Exceedingly great efforts have been put forth to reduce the cost of government. Hundreds of thousands of public employees have been released, and every department has been thoroughly deflated and placed under most competent financial supervision. The country as a whole is demanding with great vigor every possible relief from the burden of every unnecessary public expenditure. Yet notwithstanding this, minority groups of one kind or another, and organizations, sometimes almost nation-wide in their ramifications, are making the most determined assaults upon the public treasury. I am advised by the Director of the Bureau of the Budget that careful computation discloses that there are bills pending that are seriously pressed for passage, not including the bonus, which would increase the expenditures of the Federal Government for next year by about $3,600,000,000. This would mean that outside of the Post Office Department, which is practically self-sustaining, the present rate of expenditure would be more than doubled. Each one of these items taken by itself is not large, and its supporters argue that certainly the Government can afford to make this small additional payment. But taken in the aggregate they make the stupendous sum I have mentioned, and their assumption by the Government would mean nothing less than financial disaster to the nation.

Value received on the part of the Government is estimated by a general consideration of all the attending conditions. At present our country does not need a greater outlay of expense, but a greater application of constructive economy. The same state of mind is revealed again in the determined resistance which is made to the adoption of a sound method of taxation. The main argument of the opposition can all be reduced to the supposition that the general public can be relieved of taxation and a greater proportion of taxes laid oil the rich. I shall not examine the soundness of this proposal, the economic injury which it would inflict, or its impossibility as a working principle. I mention it as another example of an attempt to minister to a supposed desire to evade the law of service. It seems as though the public is assumed to desire to have the advantages of a government without paying its part of the cost of maintaining it. Besides being convinced that such a result is utterly impossible of accomplishment, I am even more firmly of the belief that it misrepresents the general attitude of the public mind. Moreover, the success of the Government does riot lie in wringing all the revenue it can from the people, but in making their burden as light and fairly distributed as possible, consistent with the proper maintenance of the necessary public functions. The Government itself, in order to be successful, and all of those connected with it, must put all of their energy upon what they can do for the people, not upon what they can get out of them. These are some of the reasons which reveal to us why, in our domestic affairs, we must be possessed of accurate information of the doings and needs of others, in order that we may best serve ourselves by serving them through appropriate action.

While I have thought it desirable to point out dangerous tendencies, I know that with few exceptions the management of our Government has been and is in honest and competent hands, that its finances are sound and well managed, and that the business interests of the nation, including the owners, managers and employees, are representative of honorable and patriotic motives, and that the present economic condition warrants a continuation of confidence and prosperity. It has both the power and disposition to maintain itself in a healthy economic and moral condition. But it can not do this by turning all its thoughts in on itself, or by making its material prosperity its supreme choice. Selfishness is only another name for suicide. The progress of the world rests on courage, honor and faith. If America wishes to maintain its prosperity, it must maintain its ideals. When we turn to our foreign relations, we see the working out of the same laws. If there is one ideal of national existence to which America has adhered more consistently than to any other, it has been that of peace. Whatever other faults may be charged to our country, it has never been quarrelsome, belligerent, or bent on military aggrandisement. After all, the main support of peace is understanding. It is a matter of accurate information by one government and one people about other governments and other peoples.

Up to a little more than twenty-five years ago, America gave almost its entire attention to self-development. In that it achieved an unequaled success.

It is not too much to say that in meeting and bringing to a successful conclusion that conflict our country performed a world service. This was followed by a period of most remarkable industrial development. There were great consolidations of properties, enormous investments of capital, and a stupendous increase of production, all accompanied by a growth of population reaching many millions. This was our condition at the outbreak of the World War. For a long time we sought to avoid this conflict, on the assumption that it did not concern us. On that subject we were lacking in accurate information. We found, at last, that while it was also the grave concern of others, it did concern us intimately and perilously. We took our part in the war at length, in the defense of free institutions. We believe, while acknowledging that we were only one of the contributing elements, that our participation was a decisive factor. The result was a demonstration of the strength of self-governing peoples, and a victory for free institutions. Our action at this time was distinctly a world service. America made its sacrifice for what it believed was the cause of righteousness. The sacrifices made on these occasions, which resulted in a benefit to others, resulted likewise in a benefit to ourselves. Even the evil effects which always arise from war and its aftermath have only tempered, not obliterated, these results. A flow of material resources set in toward our country, which is still going on. The general standards of living were raised. In the resulting plenty many of the did hardships of existence were removed. Our country came into a position where it had a greatly increased opportunity for world leadership. In moral power it took a higher rank. There can be little doubt that our presence at the treaty table softened the terms and diminished the exactions of the victorious nations, where joint covenants of defensive alliance were in part substituted for the usual territorial transfers.

Although indirectly interested by reason of our commerce, and more especially because of the debts due to us, in having a European settlement, our Government felt that the fundamental questions involved in all these discussions were the direct political concern of Europe. Our policy relative to the debts due to us from European countries was well known, and we refused to submit them to these discussions. This never meant that America was not willing to lend its assistance to the solution of the European problem in any way that did not involve us in their purely political controversies, whenever opportunity presented a plan that promised to be just and effective. But we realized that all effort was useless until all parties came to a state of mind where they saw the need to make concessions and accept friendly counsel. In December of the year of 1922 our Secretary of State, Mr. Hughes, set out the American proposal in an address which he delivered at New Haven. He recognized that settlement of the reparations question was probably impossible if approached after the method of a political problem. It was not so much a question to be dealt with by public officers or diplomatic agencies, which must necessarily reflect to a very marked degree the political state of mind of the various countries, but was represented as me which could be solved by the application of pure business talent and experienced private enterprise. To such an effort of business men, unhampered by every unnecessary political consideration, Mr. Hughes expressed the belief that competent American citizens in private life would be ready to lend their assistance. Its correctness was finally demonstrated when Mr. Dawes, Mr. Young and Mr. Robinson were invited by the Reparations Commission for that purpose, and consented to serve. The finding of the experts, which is known as the Dawes Report, has recently been made and published. It shows a great deal of research and investigation, and a broad comprehension of the requirements of the situation. It has been favorably received by the Reparations Commission. It is gratifying to understand that the Allies are looking upon it with full sympathy, and Germany has expressed a willingness to cooperate in the execution of the plan.

If this result is secured, the credit which will be due to the Secretary of State, Mr. Hughes, to ENTITY Harding for adopting it and supporting it, and to the three Americans and their assistants, by whose wisdom and discretion it was formulated and rendered so acceptable, will be sufficient to warrant the lasting approbation of two continents. A situation at once both intricate and difficult has been met in a most masterful way. Our countrymen are justified in looking at the result with great pride. Nothing of more importance to Europe has occurred since the Armistice. Part of the plan contemplates that a considerable loan should at once be made to Germany for immediate pressing needs, including the financing of a bank. I trust that private American capital will be willing to participate in advancing this loan. Sound business reasons exist why we should participate in the financing of works of peace in Europe, though we have repeatedly asserted that we were not in favor of advancing funds for any military purpose. It would benefit our trade and commerce, and we especially hope that it will provide a larger market for our agricultural production. It is notorious that foreign gold has been flowing into our country in great abundance. It is altogether probable that some of it can be used more to our financial advantage in Europe than it can be in the United States. Besides this, there is the humanitarian requirement, which carries such a strong appeal, and the knowledge that out of our abundance it is our duty to help where help will be used for meeting just requirements and the promotion of a peaceful purpose. We have determined to maintain, and can maintain, our own political independence, but our economic independence will be strengthened and increased when the economic stability of Europe is restored. We hope further that such a condition will be the beginning of a secure and enduring peace.

A final adjustment for the liquidation of reparations ought to be the beginning of a new era of peace and good will. In the event that such a condition develops, it becomes pertinent to examine what can be done by our own country, in cooperation with others, further to rid ourselves and the rest of the world of the menace and burden of competitive armaments and more effectively insure the settlement of differences between nations, not by a recourse to arms, but by a recourse to reason; not by action leading to war, but by action leading to justice. Our past experience should warn us not to be overconfident in the face of so many failures, but it also justifies the hope that something may be done where already there has been some success, and at least we can demonstrate that we have done all that we can. As a result of American initiative there is already in existence the Hague Tribunal which is equipped to function wherever arbitration seems desirable, and based in part on that, and in part on the League, there is the International Court of Justice, which is already functioning. A proposal was sent to the last Senate by PRESIDENT Harding for our adherence to the covenant establishing this court, which I submitted to the favorable consideration of the present Senate in my annual message. Other plans for a World Court have been broached, but up to the present time this has seemed to me the most practical one. But these proposals for arbitration and courts are not put forward by those who are well informed with the idea that they could be relied upon as an adequate means for entirely preventing war. They are rather a method of securing adjustment of claims and differences, and for the enforcement of treaties, when the usual channels of diplomatic negotiation fail to resolve the difficulty. Proposals have also been made for the codification of international law. Undoubtedly something might be accomplished in this direction, although a very large body of such law consists in undertaking to establish rules of warfare and determining the rights of neutrals. One of the difficulties to be encountered would be the necessity of securing the consent of all the nations, but no doubt the agreement of the major Powers would go very far in producing that result.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresstheannualluncheontheassociatedpressnewyorkcity0", "title": "Address to the Annual Luncheon of the Associated Press in New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-annual-luncheon-the-associated-press-new-york-city-0", "publication_date": "22-04-1924", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Calvin Coolidge"], "gender": ["M"]}}

There are certain definite things, however, that I believe can be done, which certainly ought to be tried, that might relieve the people of the earth of much of the burden of military armaments and diminish the probability of military operations. I believe that among these are frequent international conferences suited to particular needs. The Washington Conference did a great deal to restore harmony and good will among the nations. Another purpose of a conference is the further limitation of competitive armaments. Much remains to be accomplished in that direction. It would appear to be impractical to attempt action under present conditions, but with a certain and definite settlement of German reparations firmly established, I should favor the calling of a similar conference to achieve such limitations of armaments and initiate plans for a codification of international law, should preliminary inquiries disclose that such a proposal would meet with a sympathetic response. But the main hope of success lies in first securing a composed state of the public mind in Europe. It is my firm belief that America is in a position to take the lead in this direction. It is undoubtedly too much to suppose that we hold very much of the affectionate regard of other nations. At the same time we do hold their respect. Our position is such that we are trusted and our business institutions and Government considered to be worthy of confidence. If there is disappointment in some directions that we do not enter alliances with them, it is more than overbalanced by the knowledge that there is no danger that we shall enter alliances against them. It must be known to every people that we are seeking no acquisition of territory, and maintaining no military establishment with unfriendly and hostile intent. Like our political institutions, all of this is a powerful example throughout the world. Very many of the nations have been the recipients of our favor, and have had the advantage of our help in some time of extremity. We have no traditional enemies. We have come to a position of great power and great responsibility. Our first duty is to ourselves. The freedom of the people politically, economically, intellectually, morally and spiritually, must continue to be advanced. This is not a matter of a day or a year.

This Congress has already reserved for itself an honored chapter in the history of America. Our Nation tonight is engaged in a brutal and bitter conflict in Vietnam. Later on I want to discuss that struggle in some detail with you. It just must be the center of our concerns. But we will not permit those who fire upon us in Vietnam to win a victory over the desires and the intentions of all the American people. This Nation is mighty enough, its society is healthy enough, its people are strong enough, to pursue our goals in the rest of the world while still building a Great Society here at home. And that is what I have come here to ask of you tonight. I recommend that you provide the resources to carry forward, with full vigor, the great health and education programs that you enacted into law last year. I recommend that we prosecute with vigor and determination our war on poverty. I recommend that you give a new and daring direction to our foreign aid program, designed to make a maximum attack on hunger and disease and ignorance in those countries that are determined to help themselves, and to help those nations that are trying to control population growth. I recommend that you make it possible to expand trade between the United States and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. I recommend to you a program to rebuild completely, on a scale never before attempted, entire central and slum areas of several of our cities in America. I recommend that you attack the wasteful and degrading poisoning of our rivers, and, as the cornerstone of this effort, clean completely entire large river basins. I recommend that you meet the growing menace of crime in the streets by building up law enforcement and by revitalizing the entire Federal system from prevention to probation. I recommend that you take additional steps to insure equal justice to all of our people by effectively enforcing nondiscrimination in Federal and State jury selection, by making it a serious Federal crime to obstruct public and private efforts to secure civil rights, and by outlawing discrimination in the sale and rental of housing.

Because of Vietnam we cannot do all that we should, or all that we would like to do. We will ruthlessly attack waste and inefficiency. We will make sure that every dollar is spent with the thrift and with the commonsense which recognizes how hard the taxpayer worked in order to earn it. We will continue to meet the needs of our people by continuing to develop the Great Society. Last year alone the wealth that we produced increased $47 billion, and it will soar again this year to a total over $720 billion. Because our economic policies have produced rising revenues, if you approve every program that I recommend tonight, our total budget deficit will be one of the lowest in many years. Total spending in the administrative budget will be $112.8 billion. On a cash basis which is the way that you and I keep our family budget the Federal budget next year will actually show a surplus. That is to say, if we include all the money that your Government will take in and all the money that your Government will spend, your Government next year will collect one-half billion dollars more than it will spend in the year 1967.

I have come here to recommend that you, the representatives of the richest Nation on earth, you, the elected servants of a people who live in abundance unmatched on this globe, you bring the most urgent decencies of life to all of your fellow Americans. Who will they sacrifice? Are they going to sacrifice the children who seek the learning, or the sick who need medical care, or the families who dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home? Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land, the hope of our poor? Time may require further sacrifices. And if it does, then we will make them.

And let no one think that the unfortunate and the oppressed of this land sit stifled and alone in their hope tonight. Hundreds of their servants and their protectors sit before me tonight here in this great Chamber. The Great Society leads us along three roads growth and justice and liberation. First is growth the national prosperity which supports the well-being of our people and which provides the tools of our progress. I can report to you tonight what you have seen for yourselves already in every city and countryside. Workers are making more money than ever with after-tax income in the past 5 years up 33 percent; in the last year alone, up 8 percent. More people are working than ever before in our history an increase last year of 2 1/2 million jobs. Corporations have greater after-tax earnings than ever in history. For the past 5 years those earnings have been up over 65 percent, and last year alone they had a rise of 20 percent. Over the past 5 years it is up 40 percent, and over the past year it is up 22 percent alone. I was informed this afternoon by the distinguished Secretary of the Treasury that his preliminary estimates indicate that our balance of payments deficit has been reduced from $2.8 billion in 1964 to $1.3 billion, or less, in 1965. This achievement has been made possible by the patriotic voluntary cooperation of businessmen and bankers working with your Government. We must now work together with increased urgency to wipe out this balance of payments deficit altogether in the next year. And as our economy surges toward new heights we must increase our vigilance against the inflation which raises the cost of living and which lowers the savings of every family in this land. It is essential, to prevent inflation, that we ask both labor and business to exercise price and wage restraint, and I do so again tonight. I believe it desirable, because of increased military expenditures, that you temporarily restore the automobile and certain telephone excise tax reductions made effective only 12 days ago.

Justice means a man's hope should not be limited by the color of his skin. I propose legislation to establish unavoidable requirements for nondiscriminatory jury selection in Federal and State courts and to give the Attorney General the power necessary to enforce those requirements. I propose legislation to strengthen authority of Federal courts to try those who murder, attack, or intimidate either civil rights workers or others exercising their constitutional rights and to increase penalties to a level equal to the nature of the crime. For that other nation within a Nation the poor whose distress has now captured the conscience of America, I will ask the Congress not only to continue, but to speed up the war on poverty. And in so doing, we will provide the added energy of achievement with the increased efficiency of experience. To improve the life of our rural Americans and our farm population, we will plan for the future through the establishment of several new Community Development Districts, improved education through the use of Teacher Corps teams, better health measures, physical examinations, and adequate and available medical resources. For those who labor, I propose to improve unemployment insurance, to expand minimum wage benefits, and by the repeal of section 14 of the Taft-Hartley Act to make the labor laws in all our States equal to the laws of the 31 States which do not have tonight right-to-work measures. And I also intend to ask the Congress to consider measures which, without improperly invading State and local authority, will enable us effectively to deal with strikes which threaten irreparable damage to the national interest. The third path is the path of liberation. It is to use our success for the fulfillment of our lives. A great nation is one which breeds a great people. A great people flower not from wealth and power, but from a society which spurs them to the fullness of their genius.

Let us fulfill and improve the great health and education programs of last year, extending special opportunities to those who risk their lives in our Armed Forces. I urge the House of Representatives to complete action on three programs already passed by the Senate the Teacher Corps, rent assistance, and home rule for the District of Columbia. In some of our urban areas we must help rebuild entire sections and neighborhoods containing, in some cases, as many as 100,000 people. Working together, private enterprise and government must press forward with the task of providing homes and shops, parks and hospitals, and all the other necessary parts of a flourishing community where our people can come to live the good life. I will offer other proposals to stimulate and to reward planning for the growth of entire metropolitan areas. Of all the reckless devastations of our national heritage, none is really more shameful than the continued poisoning of our rivers and our air. We must undertake a cooperative effort to end pollution in several river basins, making additional funds available to help draw the plans and construct the plants that are necessary to make the waters of our entire river systems clean, and make them a source of pleasure and beauty for all of our people. To attack and to overcome growing crime and lawlessness, I think we must have a stepped-up program to help modernize and strengthen our local police forces. Our people have a right to feel secure in their homes and on their streets and that right just must be secured. Nor can we fail to arrest the destruction of life and property on our highways. I will propose a Highway Safety Act of 1966 to seek an end to this mounting tragedy. We must also act to prevent the deception of the American consumer requiring all packages to state clearly and truthfully their contents all interest and credit charges to be fully revealed and keeping harmful drugs and cosmetics away from our stores. It is the genius of our Constitution that under its shelter of enduring institutions and rooted principles there is ample room for the rich fertility of American political invention.

I will propose in addition a program to construct and to flight-test a new supersonic transport airplane that will fly three times the speed of sound in excess of 2,000 miles per hour. I propose to examine our Federal system-the relation between city, State, Nation, and the citizens themselves. We need a commission of the most distinguished scholars and men of public affairs to do this job. I will ask them to move on to develop a creative federalism to best use the wonderful diversity of our institutions and our people to solve the problems and to fulfill the dreams of the American people. As the process of election becomes more complex and more costly, we must make it possible for those without personal wealth to enter public life without being obligated to a few large contributors. Therefore, I will submit legislation to revise the present unrealistic restriction on contributions to prohibit the endless proliferation of committees, bringing local and State committees under the act to attach strong teeth and severe penalties to the requirement of full disclosure of contributions-and to broaden the participation of the people, through added tax incentives, to stimulate small contributions to the party and to the candidate of their choice. To strengthen the work of Congress I strongly urge an amendment to provide a 4-year term for Members of the House of Representatives-which should not begin before 1972. The present 2-year term requires most Members of Congress to divert enormous energies to an almost constant process of campaigning depriving this Nation of the fullest measure of both their skill and their wisdom. Today, too, the work of government is far more complex than in our early years, requiring more time to learn and more time to master the technical tasks of legislating. And a longer term will serve to attract more men of the highest quality to political life. The Nation, the principle of democracy, and, I think, each congressional district, will all be better served by a 4-year term for Members of the House. And I urge your swift action.

An America that is mighty beyond description-yet living in a hostile or despairing world would be neither safe nor free to build a civilization to liberate the spirit of man. In this pursuit we helped rebuild Western Europe. We gave our aid to Greece and Turkey, and we defended the freedom of Berlin. In this pursuit we have helped new nations toward independence. We have extended the helping hand of the Peace Corps and carried forward the largest program of economic assistance in the world. And in this pursuit we work to build a hemisphere of democracy and of social justice. In this pursuit we have defended against Communist aggression in Korea under President Truman in the Formosa Straits under President Eisenhower in Cuba under President Kennedy and again in Vietnam. Tonight Vietnam must hold the center of our attention, but across the world problems and opportunities crowd in on the American Nation. I will discuss them fully in the months to come, and I will follow the five continuing lines of policy that America has followed under its last four Presidents. Tonight I can tell you that we are strong enough to keep all of our commitments. We will need expenditures of $58.3 billion for the next fiscal year to maintain this necessary defense might. While special Vietnam expenditures for the next fiscal year are estimated to increase by $5.8 billion, I can tell you that all the other expenditures put together in the entire Federal budget will rise this coming year by only $.6 billion. This is true because of the stringent cost-conscious economy program inaugurated in the Defense Department, and followed by the other departments of Government. A second principle of policy is the effort to control, and to reduce, and to ultimately eliminate the modern engines of destruction. We will vigorously pursue existing proposals-and seek new ones to control arms and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.

From the Marshall plan to this very moment tonight, that policy has rested on the claims of compassion, and the certain knowledge that only a people advancing in expectation will build secure and peaceful lands. This year I propose major new directions in our program of foreign assistance to help those countries who will help themselves. We will conduct a worldwide attack on the problems of hunger and disease and ignorance. We will place the matchless skill and the resources of our own great America, in farming and in fertilizers, at the service of those countries committed to develop a modern agriculture. We will aid those who educate the young in other lands, and we will give children in other continents the same head start that we are trying to give our own children. To advance these ends I will propose the International Education Act of 1966. I will also propose the International Health Act of 1966 to strike at disease by a new effort to bring modern skills and knowledge to the uncared-for, those suffering in the world, and by trying to wipe out smallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world during this next decade; to help countries trying to control population growth, by increasing our research and we will earmark funds to help their efforts. In the next year, from our foreign aid sources, we propose to dedicate $1 billion to these efforts, and we call on all who have the means to join us in this work in the world.

In the South a people struggled to build a nation, with the friendly help of the United States. There were some in South Vietnam who wished to force Communist rule on their own people. Their hope of success was dim. Then, little more than 6 years ago, North Vietnam decided on conquest. And from that day to this, soldiers and supplies have moved from North to South in a swelling stream that is swallowing the remnants of revolution in aggression. We could leave, abandoning South Vietnam to its attackers and to certain conquest, or we could stay and fight beside the people of South Vietnam. We will stay because a just nation cannot leave to the cruelties of its enemies a people who have staked their lives and independence on America's solemn pledge a pledge which has grown through the commitments of three American ENTITYs. We will stay because in Asia and around the world are countries whose independence rests, in large measure, on confidence in America's word and in America's protection.

And we will continue to help the people of South Vietnam care for those that are ravaged by battle, create progress in the villages, and carry forward the healing hopes of peace as best they can amidst the uncertain terrors of war. The days may become months, and the months may become years, but we will stay as long as aggression commands us to battle. There may be some who do not want peace, whose ambitions stretch so far that war in Vietnam is but a welcome and convenient episode in an immense design to subdue history to their will.

But what I want to say to you, the people of the country, is of such immediate need and relates so closely to the lives of human beings and the prevention of human suffering that I have felt that there should be no delay. In this decision I have been strengthened by the thought that by speaking tonight there may be greater peace of mind and the hope of Easter may be more real at firesides everywhere, and that it is not inappropriate to encourage peace when so many of us are thinking of the Prince of Peace. Five years ago we faced a very serious problem of economic and social recovery. For four and a half years that recovery proceeded apace. It is only in the past seven months that it has received a visible setback. And it is only within the past two months, as we have waited patiently to see whether the forces of business itself would counteract it, that it has become apparent that government itself can no longer safely fail to take aggressive government steps to meet it. This recession has not returned us to the disasters and suffering of the beginning of 1933. Your money in the bank is safe; farmers are no longer in deep distress and have greater purchasing power; dangers of security speculation have been minimized; national income is almost 50 per cent higher than in 1932; and government has an established and accepted responsibility for relief. But I know that many of you have lost your jobs or have seen your friends or members of your families lose their jobs, and I do not propose that the government shall pretend not to see these things. I know that the effect of our present difficulties has been uneven; that they have affected some groups and some localities seriously, but that they have been scarcely felt in others. But I conceive the first duty of government is to protect the economic welfare of all the people in all sections and in all groups. I said in my message opening the last session of Congress that if private enterprise did not provide jobs this spring, government would take up the slack that I would not let the people down.

Under the inexorable law of supply and demand, supplies so overran demand which would pay that production was compelled to stop. I pointed out to the Congress that the national income not the Government's income, but the total of the income of all the individual citizens and families of the United States every farmer, every worker, every banker, every professional man and every person who lived on income derived from investments that national income amounted, in the year 1929, to eighty-one billion dollars. By 1932 this had fallen to thirty-eight billion dollars. Gradually, and up to a few months ago, it had risen to a total of sixty-eight billion dollars a pretty good come-back from the low point. But the very vigor of the recovery in both durable goods and consumers' goods brought into the picture early in 1937 certain highly undesirable practices, which were in large part responsible for the economic decline which began in the later months of that year. Again production outran the ability to buy. One was fear fear of war abroad, fear of inflation, fear of nationwide strikes. None of these fears has been borne out. Production in many important lines of goods outran the ability of the public to purchase them. For example, through the winter and spring of 1937 cotton factories in hundreds of cases were running on a three-shift basis, piling up cotton goods in the factory and in the hands of middle men and retailers. For example, also, automobile manufacturers not only turned out a normal increase of finished cars, but encouraged the normal increase to run into abnormal figures, using every known method to push their sales. This meant, of course, that the steel mills of the Nation ran on a twenty-four hour basis, and the tire companies and cotton factories speeded up to meet the same type of abnormally stimulated demand. The buying power of the Nation lagged behind. Thus by the autumn of 1937 the Nation again had stocks on hand which the consuming public could not buy because the purchasing power of the consuming public had not kept pace with the production. During the same period the prices of many vital products had risen faster than was warranted.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsfiresidechat15", "title": "Fireside Chat.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/fireside-chat-15", "publication_date": "14-04-1938", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

In many lines of goods and materials, prices got so high that buyers and builders ceased to buy or to build. The economic process of getting out the raw materials, putting them through the manufacturing and finishing processes, selling them to the retailers, selling them to the consumer, and finally using them got completely out of balance. The laying off of workers came upon us last autumn and has been continuing at such a pace ever since that all of us, Government and banking and business and workers, and those faced with destitution, recognize the need for action. All of this I said to the Congress today and I repeat it to you, the people of the country tonight. I went on to point out to the Senate and the House of Representatives that all the energies of government and business must be directed to increasing the national income, to putting more people into private jobs, to giving security and a feeling of security to all people in all walks of life. I am constantly thinking of all our people unemployed and employed alike- of their human problems of food and clothing and homes and education and health and old age. You and I agree that security is our greatest need; the chance to work, the opportunity of making a reasonable profit in our business-whether it be a very small business or a larger one the possibility of selling our farm products for enough money for our families to live on decently. I know these are the things that decide the well-being of all our people. Therefore, I am determined to do all in my power to help you attain that security, and because I know that the people themselves have a deep conviction that secure prosperity of that kind cannot be a lasting one except on a basis of business fair dealing and a basis where all from top to bottom share in prosperity I repeated to the Congress today that neither it nor the Chief Executive can afford to weaken or destroy great reforms which, during the past five years, have been effected on behalf of the American people.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsfiresidechat15", "title": "Fireside Chat.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/fireside-chat-15", "publication_date": "14-04-1938", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

We have recognized the right of labor to free organization, to collective bargaining; and machinery for the handling of labor relations is now in existence. The principles are established even though we can all admit that, through the evolution of time, administration and practices can be improved. Such improvement can come about most quickly and most peacefully through sincere efforts to understand and assist on the part of labor leaders and employers alike. The never-ceasing evolution of human society will doubtless bring forth new problems which will require new adjustments. Our immediate task is to consolidate and maintain the gains achieved. In this situation there is no reason and no occasion for any American to allow his fears to be aroused or his energy and enterprise to be paralyzed by doubt or uncertainty. I came to the conclusion that the present-day problem calls for action both by the Government and by the people, that we suffer primarily from a failure of consumer demand because of lack of buying power. It is up to us to create an economic upturn. How and where can and should the Government help to start an upward spiral? I went on to propose three groups of measures and I will summarize the recommendations. First, I asked for certain appropriations which are intended to keep the Government expenditures for work relief and similar purposes during the coming fiscal year at the same rate of expenditure as at present. That includes additional money for the Works Progress Administration; additional funds for the Farm Security Administration; additional allotments for the National Youth Administration, and more money for the Civilian Conservation Corps, in order that it can maintain the existing number of camps now in operation. These appropriations, made necessary by increased unemployment, will cost about a billion and a quarter more than the estimates which I sent to the Congress on the third of January.

These two steps, taking care of relief needs and adding to bank credits, are in our judgment insufficient by themselves to start the Nation on a sustained upward movement. Therefore, I came to the third kind of Government action which I consider to be vital. You and I cannot afford to equip ourselves with two rounds of ammunition where three rounds are necessary. If we stop at relief and credit, we may find ourselves without ammunition before the enemy is routed. If we are fully equipped with the third round of ammunition, we stand to win the battle against adversity. The third proposal is to make definite additions to the purchasing power of the Nation by providing new work over and above the continuing of the old work. Third, to add one hundred million dollars to the estimate for federal aid highways in excess of the amount I recommended in January. In recommending this program I am thinking not only of the immediate economic needs of the people of the Nation, but also of their personal liberties the most precious possession of all Americans. I am thinking of our democracy and of the recent trend in other parts of the world away from the democratic ideal. Democracy has disappeared in several other great nations-not because the people of those nations disliked democracy, but because they had grown tired of unemployment and insecurity, of seeing their children hungry while they sat helpless in the face of government confusion and government weakness through lack of leadership in government. Finally, in desperation, they chose to sacrifice liberty in the hope of getting something to eat. We in America know that our own democratic institutions can be preserved and made to work. But in order to preserve them we need to act together, to meet the problems of the Nation boldly, and to prove that the practical operation of democratic government is equal to the task of protecting the security of the people. Not only our future economic soundness but the very soundness of our democratic institutions depends on the determination of our Government to give employment to idle men. The people of America are in agreement in defending their liberties at any cost, and the first line of that defense lies in the protection of economic security. Your Government, seeking to protect democracy, must prove that Government is stronger than the forces of business depression.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsfiresidechat15", "title": "Fireside Chat.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/fireside-chat-15", "publication_date": "14-04-1938", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

If by democratic methods people get a government strong enough to protect them from fear and starvation, their democracy succeeds; but if they do not, they grow impatient. Therefore, the only sure bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interests of the people, and a people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over its government. We are a rich Nation; we can afford to pay for security and prosperity without having to sacrifice our liberties in the bargain. In the first century of our republic we were short of capital, short of workers and short of industrial production; but we were rich in free land, free timber and free mineral wealth. The Federal Government rightly assumed the duty of promoting business and relieving depression by giving subsidies of land and other resources. Thus, from our earliest days we have had a tradition of substantial government help to our system of private enterprise. But today the government no longer has vast tracts of rich land to give away and we have discovered that we must spend large sums to conserve our land from further erosion and our forests from further depletion. The situation is also very different from the old days, because now we have plenty of capital, banks and insurance companies loaded with idle money; plenty of industrial productive capacity and several millions of workers looking for jobs. It is following tradition as well as necessity, if Government strives to put idle money and idle men to work, to increase our public wealth and to build up the health and strength of the people and to help our system of private enterprise to function. It is going to cost Something to get out of this recession this way, but the profit of getting out of it will pay for the cost several times over. Every day that a workman is unemployed, or a machine is unused, or a business organization is marking time, is a loss to the Nation. Because of idle men and idle machines this Nation lost one hundred billion dollars between 1929 and the spring of 1933. This year you, the people of this country, are making about twelve billion dollars less than last year. If you think back to the experiences of the early years of this Administration you will remember the doubts and fears expressed about the rising expenses of Government.

No doubt you will be told that the Government spending program of the past five years did not cause the increase in our national income. They will tell you that business revived because of private spending and investment. That is true in part, for the Government spent only a small part of the total. But Government spending acted as a trigger to set off private activity. That is why the total addition to our national production and national income has been so much greater than the contribution of the Government itself. I want to make it clear that we do not believe that we can get an adequate rise in national income merely by investing, lending or spending public funds. It is essential in our economy that private funds be put to work and all of us recognize that such funds are entitled to a fair profit. The Government contribution of land that we once made to business was the land of all the people. And the Government contribution of money which we now make to business ultimately comes out of the labor of all the people. It is, therefore, only sound morality, as well as a sound distribution of buying power, that the benefits of the prosperity coming from this use of the money of all the people should be distributed among all the people- at the bottom as well as at the top. Consequently I am again expressing my hope that the Congress will enact at this session a wage and hour bill putting a floor under industrial wages and a limit on working hours to ensure a better distribution of our prosperity, a better distribution of available work, and a sounder distribution of buying power. You may get all kinds of impressions in regard to the total cost of this new program, or in regard to the amount that will be added to the net national debt.

Such an addition to the net debt of the United States need not give concern to any citizen, for it will return to the people of the United States many times over in increased buying power and eventually in much greater Government tax receipts because of the increase in the citizen income. What I said to the Congress in the close of my message I repeat to you. Let us unanimously recognize the fact that the Federal debt, whether it be twenty-five billions or forty billions, can only be paid if the Nation obtains a vastly increased citizen income. I repeat that if this citizen income can be raised to eighty billion dollars a year the national Government and the overwhelming majority of State and local governments will be 'out of the red.' The higher the national income goes the faster shall we be able to reduce the total of Federal and state and local debts. Viewed from every angle, today's purchasing power the citizens' income of today is not sufficient to drive the economic system at higher speed. Responsibility of Government requires us at this time to supplement the normal processes and in so supplementing them to make sure that the addition is adequate. We must start again on a long steady upward incline in national income. . . . And in that process, which I believe is ready to start, let us avoid the pitfalls of the past the overproduction, the overspeculation, and indeed all the extremes which we did not succeed in avoiding in 1929. In all of this, Government cannot and should not act alone. We need more than the materials of recovery. We need a united national will. We need to recognize nationally that the demands of no group, however just, can be satisfied unless that group is prepared to share in finding a way to produce the income from which it and all other groups can be paid. You, as the Congress, I, as the ENTITY, must, by virtue of our offices, seek the national good by preserving the balance between all groups and all sections.

We have brought ourselves to a time of transition, from war toward peace, and this is a good time to gain some perspective on where we are and where we are headed. Today I am sending to the Congress my second annual comprehensive report on the conduct of our foreign affairs. It discusses not only what we have done but why we have done it, and how we intend to proceed in the future. I do not intend to summarize all that is in my detailed report on foreign policy at this time. How we are getting out of the war this Nation has been in for the past 6 years; How we have created a new and different foreign policy approach for the United States in a greatly changed world; and How we are applying that approach in working with others to build a lasting peace. The most immediate and anguishing problem that faced this Administration 2 years ago was the war in Vietnam. Two years ago, when this Administration took office, there were almost 550,000 Americans in Vietnam. Within 60 days we will have brought home 260,000 men, and this spring I will announce a new schedule of withdrawals. Two years ago, the additional demands of the Vietnam war cost us approximately $22 billion per year. That cost has been cut in half. Much of the progress in Vietnam was due to the success of the allied operations against the enemy sanctuaries in Cambodia last spring. American casualties after Cambodia have been half the rate they were before Cambodia. Our decision to clean out the sanctuaries in Cambodia saved thousands of American lives. And it enabled us to continue withdrawing our men on schedule. Just as last year's cutoff of supplies through Cambodia has saved lives and insured our withdrawal program this year, the purpose of this year's disruption of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos is to save lives and insure the success of our withdrawal program next year. The disruption of the Communist supply line through Laos is being accomplished by South Vietnamese troops, with no U.S. ground troops or advisers. Their army is doing the fighting, with our air support, and the intensity of the fighting is evidence of the importance of that supply line to the enemy.

Negotiation remains the best and quickest way to end the war in a way that will not only end U.S. involvement and casualties but will mean an end to the fighting between North and South Vietnamese. On October 7, we made a proposal that could open the door to that kind of peace. an immediate standstill cease-fire throughout Indochina to stop the fighting, an Indochina peace conference, the withdrawal of all outside forces, a political settlement fair to both sides, the immediate release of all prisoners of war. I reaffirm that proposal today. It is supported by every government in Indochina except one the Government of North Vietnam. I once again urge Hanoi to join us in this search for peace. If North Vietnam wishes to negotiate with the United States, they will have to recognize that time is running out. With the exception of the prisoners-of-war issue, if North Vietnam continues to refuse to discuss our peace proposals, they will soon find they have no choice but to negotiate only with the South Vietnamese. Our eventual goal is a total withdrawal of all outside forces. But as long as North Vietnam continues to hold a single American prisoner, we shall have forces in South Vietnam. The American prisoners of war will not be forgotten by their Government. I am keeping my pledge to end America's involvement in this war.

But today our allies and friends have gained new strength and self-confidence. They are now able to participate much more fully not only in their own defense but in adding their moral and spiritual strength to the creation of a stable world order. Today our adversaries no longer present a solidly united front; we can now differentiate in our dealings with them. Today neither the United States nor the Soviet Union has a clear-cut nuclear advantage; the time is therefore ripe to come to an agreement on the control of arms. Our foreign policy must change with it. We have learned in recent years the dangers of over-involvement. That deceptively smooth road of the new isolationism is surely the road to war. Our foreign policy today steers a steady course between the past danger of over involvement and the new temptation of under-involvement. 1 We will maintain our commitments, but we will make sure our own troop levels or any financial support to other nations is appropriate to current threats and needs. We shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security. But we will look to threatened countries and their neighbors to assume primary responsibility for their own defense, and we will provide support where our interests call for that support and where it can make a difference. These principles are not limited to security matters. We shall pursue economic policies at home and abroad that encourage trade wherever possible and that strengthen political ties between nations. As we actively seek to help other nations expand their economies, we can legitimately expect them to work with us in averting economic problems of our own. As we continue to send economic aid to developing nations, we will expect countries on the receiving end to mobilize their resources; we will look to other developed nations to do more in furnishing assistance; and we will channel our aid increasingly through groups of nations banded together for mutual support. This new sharing of responsibility requires not less American leadership than in the past, but rather a new, more subtle, form of leadership.

We must strike a balance between doing too much and preventing self-reliance, and suddenly doing too little and undermining self-confidence. We intend to give our friends the time and the means to adjust, materially and psychologically, to a new form of American participation in the world. How have we applied our new foreign policy during the past year? And what is our future agenda as we work with others to build a stable world order? In Western Europe, we have shifted from predominance to partnership with our allies. Our ties with Western Europe are central to the structure of peace because its nations are rich in tradition and experience, strong economically, vigorous in diplomacy and culture; they are in a position to take a major part in building a world of peace. Our ties were strengthened on my second trip to Europe this summer and reflected in our close consultation on arms control negotiations. At our suggestion, the NATO alliance made a thorough review of its military strategy and posture. As a result, we have reached new agreement on a strong defense and the need to share the burden more fairly. In Eastern Europe, our exchange of state visits with Romania and my meeting last fall with Marshal Tito in Yugoslavia are examples of our search for wider reconciliation with the nations that used to be considered behind an Iron Curtain. We shall cooperate in our political and economic relations across the Atlantic as the Common Market grows. We and our allies will make the improvements necessary to carry out our common defense strategy. Together we stand ready to reduce forces in Western Europe in exchange for mutual reductions in Eastern Europe. The problems of Africa are great, but so is her potential. The United States will support her peoples' efforts to build a continent that provides social justice and economic expansion. Recently, we have paid new respect to their proud traditions. Our trade, credit, and economic policies have been reexamined and reformed to respond to their concerns and their ideas, as well as to our own interests.

Here the doctrine that took shape last year is taking hold today, helping to spur self-reliance and cooperation between states. In Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines, we have consolidated bases and reduced American forces. We have relaxed trade and travel restrictions to underline our readiness for greater contact with Communist China. While continuing to help our friends help themselves, we must begin to consider how regional associations can work together with the major powers in the area for a durable peace. We will work to build a strong partnership with Japan that will accommodate our mutual interests. We will search for consecutive discussions with Communist China while maintaining our defense commitment to Taiwan. When the Government of the People's Republic of China is ready to engage in talks, it will find us receptive to agreements that further the legitimate national interests of China and its neighbors. In Asia, we can see tomorrow's world in microcosm. An economically powerful democratic free nation, Japan, is seeking new markets; a potentially powerful Communist nation, China, will one day seek new outlets and new relations; a Communist competitor, the Soviet Union, has interests there as well; and the independent non-Communist nations of Southeast Asia are already working together in regional association .

In the Middle East, the United States took the initiative to stop the fighting and start the process of peace. Diplomacy was at an impasse. The danger of local conflict was magnified by growing Soviet involvement and the possibility of great powers being drawn into confrontation. America took the lead in arranging a cease-fire and getting negotiations started. We are seeing to it that the balance of power, so necessary to discourage a new outbreak of fighting, is not upset.

There are great obstacles in the way of a permanent, peaceful settlement, and painful compromise is required by all concerned. We are encouraged by the willingness of each of the parties to begin to look to the larger interest of peace and stability throughout the Middle East. There is still the risk of war, but now for the first time in years the parties are actively calculating the risks of peace. The policy of the United States will continue to be to promote peace talks-not to try to impose a peace from the outside, but to support the peace efforts of the parties in the region themselves. One way to support these efforts is for the United States to discourage any outside power from trying to exploit the situation for its own advantage. The United States is fully prepared to play a responsible and cooperative role in keeping the peace arrived at through negotiation between the parties. We know what our vital interests are in the Middle East. Those interests include friendly and constructive relations with all nations in the area. Other nations know that we are ready to protect those vital interests. And one good reason why other nations take us at our word in the Middle East is because the United States has kept its word in Southeast Asia. the relations between the world's two great super powers. Over the past e years, in some fields the Soviet Union and the United States have moved ahead together. We have taken the first step toward cooperation in outer space. We have both ratified the treaty limiting the spread of nuclear weapons. Just 2 weeks ago, we signed a treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons from the seabeds. These are hopeful signs, but certain other Soviet actions are reason for concern. We must also discourage the temptation to raise new challenges in sensitive areas such as the Caribbean. In the long run, the most significant result of negotiations between the super powers in the past year could be in the field of arms control. The strategic arms limitation talks with the Soviet Union have produced the most searching examination of the nature of strategic competition ever conducted between our two nations. Each side has had the chance to explain at length the concerns caused by the posture of the other side. The talks have been conducted in a serious way without the old lapses into propaganda.

It serves no purpose to pretend they are; our differences are not matters of mood, they are matters of substance. But in many other cases, our separate national interests can best be pursued by a sober consideration of the world interest. We will not reduce our defenses below the level I consider essential to our national security. A strong America is essential to the cause of peace today. Until we have the kind of agreements we can rely on, we shall remain strong.

Protectionism, I said, costs consumers billions of dollars, damages the overall economy, and destroys jobs. Instead of closing down markets at home and throwing Americans out of work, we should be stepping up our efforts to open markets abroad and create American jobs by increasing exports. I instructed the United States Trade Representative to begin investigations of unfair trading practices on the part of our trading partners. We have the authority to counter unfair trading practices by initiating investigations, entering negotiations, and taking active countermeasures if those negotiations are unsuccessful. one, against a Korean law that prohibits fair competition of U.S. life and fire insurance firms in the Korean market in direct contradiction of treaty obligations; two, against a Brazilian law that has restricted U.S. exports of computers and related products and squeezed out some American computer firms operating there; and three, against restrictive practices dealing with tobacco products in Japan that unfairly block U.S. entry into that market. I have also ordered acceleration of ongoing efforts to open up Japanese markets in leather and leather footwear and to challenge the European Community's subsidies on canned fruit. On these two cases we are setting a deadline of December 1, 1985. I have directed that a list be prepared of countermeasures which will be taken if these disputes are not resolved by then. We hope that through these negotiations we will be able to convince our trading partners to stop their unfair trading practices and open those markets that are now closed to American exports. We will take countermeasures only as a last resort, but our trading partners should not doubt our determination to see international trade conducted fairly with the same rules applicable to all. I am committed to and will continue to fight for fair trade. American exporters and American workers deserve a fair shake abroad, and we intend to see they get it. Our objective will always be to make world trading partnerships freer and fairer for all. So, while we will use our powers as a lever to open closed doors abroad, we will continue to resist protectionist measures that would only raise prices, lock out trade, and destroy the jobs and prosperity trade brings to all.

I have just come from a working session in the White House, working with some of the great experts on school choice. The parents, I think, made the most significant contribution to our working session because their dreams for their kids are the same dreams that all of us have. They want their kids to have a first-class education. They know from practical experience that a good education is absolutely essential to making a good living and to making a good life. So let me just share a little from that meeting. Janette Williams told me about her son, Javon. The Williamses are here with us somewhere here today whoops, here she is over here. Her kid starred on 60 Minutes, and that says something about the guy, if you go on that program and come off in one piece. But here is what she said, and this is serious. She said, At his old school that was crowded, he used to get so bored that he would walk out. And thanks to the choice program in Milwaukee, he is at a new school. He is not doing those things anymore. He is doing his homework; he is even helping clean up the classroom after school. They took the energy and turned it around. Now, the Governor here, Tommy Thompson, the Governor of Wisconsin, is here with us today. I am sorry that Polly Williams, who is been at the forefront of the school choice movement, could not be here, but she is at home looking after her mother. I would salute her values. But we miss her very, very much. Together, Polly and Tommy Thompson, the Governor, have taken the lead in helping parents like Janette Williams realize her dreams for her son Javon, creating scholarships for 1,000 Milwaukee children from low-income families so that they can attend private schools. Now, theirs is a bold experiment, to give low-income families more of the same choices of schools already available to wealthier families. Mike Joyce of the Bradley Foundation was also in our meeting. And Bradley recently joined with other foundations and Milwaukee businesses to raise $3 million so that Milwaukee's low-income families will be able to choose their family's schools, including the religious schools. Mike told us this morning that parents picked up every one of the 4,500 scholarship applications the day after the scholarships were announced, 4,500, that fast.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksannouncingproposedlegislationestablishgibillforchildren", "title": "Remarks Announcing Proposed Legislation To Establish a GI Bill for Children", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-announcing-proposed-legislation-establish-gi-bill-for-children", "publication_date": "25-06-1992", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}

A revolution is underway in Milwaukee and across this country, a revolution to make American schools the best in the world. I salute our Secretary of Education who is helping lead that revolution, Lamar Alexander. Together with the Nation's Governors, we have set six ambitious national education goals. And I might say that this was not a partisan move; Democrats and Republicans alike of the Governors coming together to set six ambitious national education goals. In 44 States and 1,400 communities, we have already launched America 2000 to meet these goals. Even earlier still, in January 1989, just before I was sworn in as ENTITY, we helped organize the White House Conference on Choice in Education. We believed then and we believe today a few fundamental truths. Parents, not bureaucrats, know what is best for their kids. At this point I would like to salute one of the two in purple, Barbara Bush for her pointing this out to parents, that it is what they do, what happens in their home. Barbara's done a lot of that here and around the country. I might say that Marilyn Quayle's taking that same message of parental involvement all across our country, and we are very grateful to her. So, it is our belief then that parents, not the Government, should choose their children's schools. So today I am proposing that we take another giant step forward in this revolution. I am sending to Congress legislation that would authorize an ambitious demonstration program, half a billion new Federal dollars to help communities all across America give $1,000 scholarships to children of middle- and low-income families so they can choose which schools their kids will attend. This revolution is in the greatest American tradition. We have done it before, and it is worked. Forty-eight years ago this very week, President Roosevelt signed the GI bill, creating scholarships that veterans could use at any college, any college of their choice. The GI bill created opportunity for Americans who never would have had it, and in doing so it helped create the best system of colleges and universities in the world. Now we can do that again, this time by helping State and local governments and we are delighted the Mayor of Milwaukee is with us here today this time by helping State and local governments create the best elementary and secondary schools in the world.

{"id": 6108, "text": "It will provide that help to these families. These dollars to spend at the schools of their choice will become the muscle that parents need to create the best schools for their kids. Let me say to those who will attack our school choice initiative on the ground that it permits Government money to go to religious schools, you are wrong. This is aid to the families, not aid to institutions. And again, if you set the clock back to the creation of that original GI bill, no one told the GI's that they could not go to S.M.U. or Notre Dame or Yeshiva or Howard. I have not heard Members of Congress suggest that students stop using Pell grants and guaranteed student loans at Baptist colleges or Presbyterian seminaries. I do not hear an outcry because poor children at Catholic schools get their lunch paid for by Federal taxpayers. In the same way, parents must be free to use this money at the school they believe will best teach their child, whether the school is public, private, or religious. Accepting students with vouchers does not mean a school must sacrifice school prayer. I simply do not buy the idea that someone cannot make a good decision just because that person is poor. We heard the same argument when we proposed child care vouchers for low-income families or when we proposed help for public housing tenants to own their own homes. So it is my belief that we ought to let families own their own home and choose their own schools regardless of their income level and give them help. Give them a shot at the American dream, if you will. All of this new money can go to public schools if that is where the child chooses to go, where the family chooses to have the kid go. That decision will be in the hands of families, where it belongs. First, I want to make it clear that we are not talking here about a new Federal entitlement program. The Federal Government cannot afford one more entitlement, even for education. The United States already spends more per student for schools than any country in the world except Switzerland.

{"id": 6109, "text": "Investment in our schools will remain a primarily State and local responsibility. But Federal support for State and local scholarships can be a catalyst. For schools that attract choice students, it will give teachers and principals a welcome source of new funds. For our children, choice can help open up opportunities, create genuine change in our schools. For too long, we have shielded schools from competition, allowed our schools a damaging monopoly power over our children. This monopoly turns students into statistics and turns parents into pawns. It is time we began thinking of a system of public education in which many providers offer a marketplace of opportunities, opportunities that give all of our children choices and access to the best education in the world. And so it is our firm belief, it is our firm belief that this GI bill for children will move America inevitably in that direction. Milwaukee is not the only place in America that our revolution is underway. Last year in Indianapolis, Pat Rooney and the Educational CHOICE Charitable Trust began to offer tuition vouchers to Indianapolis students. I understand a bus-load of parents and students drove all night to be here today. If you are still awake, welcome, a special welcome to all of you. In San Antonio, the CEO Foundation has earmarked $1.5 million in vouchers for children in their community. Joe Alibrandi and thousands of supporters are pushing for a ballot initiative to provide voucher scholarships for every school-age child in the State. Overall in 1991, 10 States approved some form of new choice legislation, and 37 States had choice legislation pending in one form or another. I have been told that there may just be a few folks here from Pennsylvania. The children of Pennsylvania will have school choice. From California to East Harlem, from coast to coast, the leaders of the school choice movement are sparking a revolution in American education. They are the true heroes of this education reform, and some of them are here with us today. They are not afraid to stand up to the status quo, to say loud and clear that when it comes to educating our kids, business-as-usual simply is not good enough. Barbara and I and the Vice President and Marilyn, and certainly our Secretary, are very proud to stand with you. It will succeed because it draws its strength from the very heart of the American creed. We have no truth more enduring than the idea that every American should have the opportunity for a first-class education. We have no principles more important than freedom, opportunity, and choice.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksannouncingproposedlegislationestablishgibillforchildren", "title": "Remarks Announcing Proposed Legislation To Establish a GI Bill for Children", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-announcing-proposed-legislation-establish-gi-bill-for-children", "publication_date": "25-06-1992", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Today I am announcing the normalization of diplomatic relationships with Vietnam. From the beginning of this administration, any improvement in relationships between America and Vietnam has depended upon making progress on the issue of Americans who were missing in action or held as prisoners of war. Last year, I lifted the trade embargo on Vietnam in response to their cooperation and to enhance our efforts to secure the remains of lost Americans and to determine the fate of those whose remains have not been found. In 17 months, Hanoi has taken important steps to help us resolve many cases. Twenty-nine families have received the remains of their loved ones and at last have been able to give them a proper burial. Hanoi has delivered to us hundreds of pages of documents shedding light on what happened to Americans in Vietnam. And Hanoi has stepped up its cooperation with Laos, where many Americans were lost. We have reduced the number of socalled discrepancy cases, in which we have had reason to believe that Americans were still alive after they were lost, to 55. And we will continue to work to resolve more cases. Hundreds of dedicated men and women are working on all these cases, often under extreme hardship and real danger in the mountains and jungles of Indochina. On behalf of all Americans, I want to thank them. And I want to pay a special tribute to General John Vessey, who has worked so tirelessly on this issue for ENTITY Reagan and Bush and for our administration. He has made a great difference to a great many families. And we as a nation are grateful for his dedication and for his service. I also want to thank the ENTITY delegation, led by Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs Hershel Gober, Winston Lord, James Wold, who have helped us to make so much progress on this issue. And I am especially grateful to the leaders of the families and the veterans organizations who have worked with the delegation and maintained their extraordinary commitment to finding the answers we seek. Never before in the history of warfare has such an extensive effort been made to resolve the fate of soldiers who did not return. Let me emphasize, normalization of our relations with Vietnam is not the end of our effort. We will keep working until we get all the answers we can. Normalization of relations is the next appropriate step. With this new relationship we will be able to make more progress.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksannouncingthenormalizationdiplomaticrelationswithvietnam", "title": "Remarks Announcing the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations With Vietnam", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-announcing-the-normalization-diplomatic-relations-with-vietnam", "publication_date": "11-07-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 6111, "text": "To that end, I will send another delegation to Vietnam this year. And Vietnam has pledged it will continue to help us find answers. We will hold them to that pledge. By helping to bring Vietnam into the community of nations, normalization also serves our interest in working for a free and peaceful Vietnam in a stable and peaceful Asia. We will begin to normalize our trade relations with Vietnam, whose economy is now liberalizing and integrating into the economy of the Asia-Pacific region. Our policy will be to implement the appropriate United States Government programs to develop trade with Vietnam consistent with U.S. law. As you know, many of these programs require certifications regarding human rights and labor rights before they can proceed. We have already begun discussing human rights issues with Vietnam, especially issues regarding religious freedom. Now we can expand and strengthen that dialog. The Secretary of State will go to Vietnam in August where he will discuss all of these issues, beginning with our POW and MIA concerns. I believe normalization and increased contact between Americans and Vietnamese will advance the cause of freedom in Vietnam, just as it did in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. I strongly believe that engaging the Vietnamese on the broad economic front of economic reform and the broad front of democratic reform will help to honor the sacrifice of those who fought for freedom's sake in Vietnam. I am proud to be joined in this view by distinguished veterans of the Vietnam war. They served their country bravely. They are of different parties. A generation ago they had different judgments about the war which divided us so deeply. But today they are of a single mind. They agree that the time has come for America to move forward on Vietnam. All Americans should be grateful especially that Senators John McCain, John Kerry, Bob Kerrey, Chuck Robb, and Representative Pete Peterson, along with other Vietnam veterans in the Congress, including Senator Harkin, Congressman Kolbe, and Congressman Gilchrest, who just left, and others who are out here in the audience have kept up their passionate interest in Vietnam but were able to move beyond the haunting and painful past toward finding common ground for the future. Today they and many other veterans support the normalization of relations, giving the opportunity to Vietnam to fully join the community of nations and being true to what they fought for so many years ago. Whatever we may think about the political decisions of the Vietnam era, the brave Americans who fought and died there had noble motives. They fought for the freedom and the independence of the Vietnamese people.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksannouncingthenormalizationdiplomaticrelationswithvietnam", "title": "Remarks Announcing the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations With Vietnam", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-announcing-the-normalization-diplomatic-relations-with-vietnam", "publication_date": "11-07-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

I want to thank all the dinner chairs and Chairman Fowler and your State chairman, Tom Byrne, and my former colleagues Jim Florio and Brendan Byrne, and Peter Duchin, who I have been enjoying for a year or two now, since I was a younger man. I want to say a special word of appreciation to Ray Lesniak because it is his birthday tonight, so I know we are all glad . I want to thank Senator Lautenberg for what he said and for what he is done in Washington, for standing up especially for the environment under a period of incredibly intense assault from the majority in Congress.

And as he leaves the United States Senate, I'd like to thank Senator Bradley for his 18 years of service to New Jersey and to America, for many, many years of friendship, counsel, and advice to me, and for the support that he gave this administration in the last 3 1/2 years.

And I have a message for those if there was some designed effort to keep him from coming up here tonight, guess what? He is still going to get the contributions, and we still know where he is, and we know what is at stake, and we are going to elect him in November, so it does not make any difference. One thing you know about Bob Torricelli is that he will stand up and fight for you with every fiber of his being. He does not do anything halfway; he is full of passion.

Bob Torricelli will protect all that. So I ask you to do what you can for the next 6 months to send Bob Torricelli to the United States Senate. Bill Bradley's shoes may be impossible to fill, but the people of New Jersey deserve someone fighting for them who is on their side and fighting for their future, not someone in the grip of an ideological theory that will only undermine our ability to go forward together.

And then, 100 years ago, we faced a period of change rather like today, when we moved from the farm to the factory, from the country to the city. There were vast new opportunities, but there was a lot of uprooting; a lot of people's lives were dislocated. And the progressive era began, with Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson saying that the power of the United States Government should be used to curb the abuses of that era and to make sure its benefits could be extended to all Americans. They had the antitrust laws, the child laws, the environment protection laws, all designed to let us have the benefits of the new industrial age without being broken by it, without having our identity as a nation, our character as a people, our ideals as expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution savaged. That is what it was all about. And then we underwent the Depression and World War II, and President Roosevelt and the Congress and the leaders of that time had to, first of all, defeat the opponents of freedom who would have killed our way of life beyond our borders and rally the American people to overcome that profound Depression and find a way to build a safety net under this country so that we could manage our economy in ways that did not permit it to crash again and break the lives of so many millions of people. Then we had to gird ourselves for the cold war, which we did, and wait for our victory to come, because communism was always founded on a total misunderstanding of human nature and the human condition. Now we are going through another period of change, economic and social change and the way we relate to the rest of the world, sort of like what happened 100 years ago. Now we have moved from a cold-war world to a global society, not just a global economy. big companies dramatically downsizing; new companies starting at a rapid rate; a lot of people doing exceedingly well; other people left behind; other people feeling uncertain about their future. When I ran for President in 1992, I got into that race because I was convinced we could no longer just sit by and let it happen, that we needed an aggressive response.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdemocraticdinnerjerseycitynewjersey", "title": "Remarks at a Democratic Dinner in Jersey City, New Jersey", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-democratic-dinner-jersey-city-new-jersey", "publication_date": "07-05-1996", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Two, the understanding that we cannot achieve that in the world in which we are living unless we find a way to come together to respect our diversity, to bridge all those gaps of race and religion and region and ethnicity. This country now has, more or less, 200 different racial and ethnic groups. It is an astonishing thing that we can find ways to come together around our core values and our respect for one another's differences. And I am sick and tired of seeing elections used as wedges to divide people one from another, to try to get people who are in the majority to look down on those who are not , and then hope we can pick up the pieces after the election. We should be uniting the American people and going forward together. And the third thing we have to do is continue to be the world's greatest force for peace and freedom and prosperity. And as I have said many times, that sounds great and everybody is for that in general, but often in particular they are not. When I took the action I did in Haiti and Bosnia, in becoming the first President to try to do something in Northern Ireland, all of the things we have done in the Middle East, what all the polls said was the most unpopular decision of my administration, trying to keep Mexico from collapsing, everything I did, I did because I know that our country has got to try to be the world's greatest source of energy for peace and freedom and prosperity, and because I know that 20 years from now we can be the strongest country in the world, but others will grow stronger, and we have to work with Russia, we have to work with China, we have to work with a uniting Europe, we have to work with emerging countries, to have them define their greatness in a way that helps us all to go forward in peace and prosperity. How will these other countries define their greatness? Will it be as we do, by how well they educate their people and what their economic achievements are and what their cultural achievements are and whether they can help their less fortunate neighbors?

And you heard Senator Lautenberg talking about it. We are moving in the right direction. It is also true that there are a lot of challenges out there. In the economic arena, we have at least three big challenges, do not we? In New Jersey, you know what one of them is. We have to figure out what to do about all these people who get downsized from big companies but who still have a lot of good years left. And we are working on that. In the next few days, I am going to have a lot of companies in the country come in, and we are going to highlight the companies that have been able to avoid that and have been able to do things that really help their employees if they have to leave. We have got to find a way, secondly, to give all of our working people a greater sense of economic security. I have heard Senator Bradley talk about this. If you cannot guarantee somebody the same job with the same company for a lifetime, then they have to know if they work hard and play by the rules, they will always be able to get new training for new work, they will always have access to health care, and they will always be able to have a pension they can carry around with them, even if they change jobs. They have to be able to know that. And lastly, we have to remember that here in New Jersey and throughout this country, in spite of the 8 1/2 million jobs, there are vast expanses within our inner cities and in our rural areas that have not felt any new investment opportunity. And do not kid yourself, when you have new jobs and growth, you also drive down the welfare rolls, you drive down the crime rate, you drive down the despair that people feel.

All of us try to succeed as workers and parents. That is what we should want poor people to do, too. Everybody should be able to succeed in that way. We have to create an educational system that gives everybody genuine opportunity. And that means, among other things, what I was doing here in New Jersey a couple of weeks ago, which is ensuring that we hook up every classroom and every library, even in the poorest schools in America, to the information superhighway in the next 4 years. We can do that, and we can revolutionize education if we do it. We have got to continue our work to lower the crime rate by having more police on the street, more prevention strategies, being tough in keeping the assault weapons ban in the Brady bill and not giving them up, and by actually doing something to give our young people something to say yes to as well as something to say no to. We can bring the crime rate down; we can make our streets safe again; we can make our neighborhoods whole again. We know how to do it. We have to continue this fight to protect the environment. It is woefully short-sighted to believe that we can walk away from our obligations to clean up the messes we have made and protect ourselves from making further ones and gain anything economically by it. Yes, we have to find smarter ways to do it. Our administration has worked hard to find ways to grow the economy and clean the environment. But if we walk away from that, we will not go into the 21st century as a country that is stronger with stronger families and stronger communities and a stronger future.

If you listen to our crowd, what do we say? We are not for big Government anymore where it is not necessary. Just remember, folks, when election time comes, they bad-mouth the Government, but we are the ones that reduced it. But we did it in a way that treated those Federal workers with dignity. We gave them generous early retirement packages and severance packages and time to find other jobs. And we did not try to make some big thing out of it. We just did it because it needed to be done. But we believe that there is a different sort of empowerment. We believe that real opportunity means not only choice but the ability to exercise the choice. You remember the great French writer Anatole France said the rich and poor are equally free to sleep under the bridge at night. Now, that is what choice is without the capacity to exercise it.

You can look at the budget of 1995, which I vetoed, at the environmental initiatives, at the differences between us. Who is right about family and medical leave? Were we right to say that you should not lose your job if you have got to take a little time off when a baby is born or a parent is sick or a child is in the hospital?

The question is, which road will you walk into the 21st century? And I tell you, I see pictures in my mind all the time that give me the answer. The other day I was at Eastern High School in Washington, DC, where all of the students are African-American except the Russian exchange students, a program you have done a lot of work on. There they were, reaching for unity over diversity. There they were, struggling to come out of poverty. There they were, asking not for a guarantee, but just for a good education and a chance at the American dream. And if I have got anything to do about it, they are going to get it. That is what they are going to get. I got two letters from two married couples I got to know not very long ago because they had desperately sick children. I know as the father of only one child, there must be no greater pain in the world than having a child die before you do.

It is about whether we will walk it together. I was over there today at the high school. We were at the high school; Senator Lautenberg talked about it. We did this antismoking program. And I was talking to the mayor on the way in about what kind of community it was. It was, except they had not only Christians and Jews among the student body, they had Hindus and Muslims among the student body, even there. I am telling you, this business of trying to drive a stake between people in this country based on their race, their ethnic background, or their religion has got to stop. We have got to stop it. We have got to stop it. Now, you do not have to guess about this; look around the rest of the world. Which road do you want to walk into the future? And I know that either I or my successors will make some mistakes in our judgments about what the United States should do around the world. But basically, it is right for us to continue to reach out to other countries. It is right for us to support peace and freedom and to try to expand our own prosperity by expanding that of others. It is right for us to be partners with other countries, even when we are tired and we want to lay our burdens down, because it is the only way to fight terrorism, the only way to fight drug dealing, the only way to fight organized crime; it is right to do that. So you get to decide about that, which road will you walk into the future. And I want to ask you when you leave here tonight to think about what else you can do for the next 6 months. I appreciate the money you have given Bob Torricelli and the Democratic Party and our efforts. I am grateful for that.

It is great to see all of you here tonight, wonderful to see so many good friends, many of you who were there from the beginning of this campaign. And I want you to all know that I appreciate everything that you have done, not just for the campaign, but also what you have done for the country and what you have done for the party. Many of you were invested in this campaign at the very beginning when nobody could pronounce my name. And you'd tell your friends, There is this young guy, I really think he is got something. So you had to confront a lot of skepticism, a lot of confusion. Some of you were involved in a campaign for the first time, and some of you got involved for the very first time in a very long time, because you believed that we were in a defining moment in our history and that your voice could make a difference. Not a single day goes by where I do not think about all the time and the energy, the money, the commitment, the unyielding faith that you put into our campaign, because it was not just about winning an election, it was about changing a country. Last year, we asked you to take on something new. We asked you to help us keep the promises that we made in the campaign, help to bring about the changes that we had talked about together. And a lot of you have worked hard to do that. You have continued to be engaged in education policy, in foreign policy, and helping us at a grassroots level and continuing to finance our ability to get our message out. It is made the successes of the last year possible. We upheld the principle of equal pay for equal work. We lifted the ban on stem cell research and restored science to its rightful place in America.

Many of you watching at home, as you go around the country and your individual communities, you see the stores shuttered and the foreclosed businesses; friends and neighbors, family members who still cannot find work. This is on top of a decade that had been tough for middle class families all across the country. They had not seen their incomes go up in years. Their costs skyrocketing at the same time as their wages were stagnant. For 2 years, I heard stories all across the country, everywhere I go. I heard stories about people trying their best to hold on; a family sitting around the kitchen table wondering if they were going to be able to retire on schedule, if they were going to be able to finance a college education for their kids, wondering when would health care costs stop climbing, when would their premiums start stabilizing. And people started expressing doubts about whether the dream that generations built and defended, the American Dream, was slipping away. That is the reason I ran for ENTITY. That is the reason you supported me.

We are going to create incentives for consumers to make their homes more energy efficient, creating jobs and saving families money.

They are not going to, alone, provide the economic security that is been dwindling for middle class families over the last decade. The only way we do that is to lay a strong foundation for growth over the long term. And the things that we talked about during the campaign are the things that still need to be done.

Change is harder when you actually dig in and try to deal with the structural problems that have impeded our progress for too long.

That was good for the country. It is good for our democracy. I had fun. Now, there are some issues that Democrats and Republicans are not going to agree on, and that is okay.

We need businesses that are thriving, and they have got to raise capital; that will help them hire workers. That is part of what this crisis has reminded us.

I am a amateur historian, so I know that seven ENTITYs, starting with Teddy Roosevelt, could not get this done. But I took it on not for its political value; I took it on because families are dealing with skyrocketing premiums and skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs and insurance companies that routinely deny coverage because of preexisting conditions, or drop people altogether when they get sick. We took it on because the costs were killing small businesses and creating an uneven playing field for our international companies, and it was eating into workers' take-home pay and canceling raises. And we took it on because it is the single best way--in fact, the only way--that we are actually going to get control of our Federal budget.

I want you to know that I thank you for being here, and you have to understand that there is a significant connection between your presence here and what happens in Washington and what has happened in Washington for the last 5 years. I do not think anyone would dispute the proposition that this country is in better shape than it was in 1992. And in 1992 when I ran for ENTITY, I wanted to take our country in a new direction based on our oldest values of work and family and opportunity and responsibility, community and world leadership, the things that America has stood for throughout this entire century, and most of it for most of our existence. But it was obvious that we needed, among other things, a different notion of Government that the arguments that I read as a Governor and every Governor I knew, including yours, had the same reaction. We'd read in the paper every day, wherever we lived out here in the hinterland, about some fight they were having in Washington. And it looked to me like they were having a fight about whether the Government should try to do everything when we were broke and could not , or whether the Government should do nothing and just sit on the sidelines because Government was the source of all of our ills. Where we lived and worked and the people we worked with, we did not think either one of those things was true. So the first thing I did was, I went there with a determination to try to get decisionmakers in Washington to rethink the notion of Government and the role of Government in moving America forward and in bringing America together. And I believe that the role of Government is to give people the tools they need and establish the conditions so they can make the most of their own lives.

When I became ENTITY, my economic policy was unanimously opposed by the other party in Congress unanimously. Not a single one of them voted for my economic plan in 1993. And they said it would be the ruination of America; it would deepen the recession; it would explode the deficit. Well, 5 years later that plan has produced $810 billion worth of deficit reduction. The deficit is 92 percent smaller than it was when I took office 92 percent. That is before it is very important you understand it that is before the bipartisan balanced budget agreement kicks in. One reason we were able to have a bipartisan balanced budget and agree on how to do it is, it is not so hard once 90 percent of the heavy lifting is behind you. And I think it is important to emphasize that. The second thing that we were able to do is to develop a national crime policy. And again, the leaders of the other party opposed my crime policy. I sometimes get tickled when I read in the paper, they talk about how the ENTITY adopted Republican positions on crime. Now, it is no secret; I have got a good personal relationship with Senator Dole and a fair and a high estimation of him. I awarded him the Medal of Freedom. The angriest I ever heard him on the floor of the Senate was when he was unsuccessful in filibustering the crime bill. He tried to kill it. The NRA was against it, said I was going to take everybody's guns away. And they said, If you put 100,000 police on the streets it would not make a lick of difference just as sort of a boondoggle. They attacked us for being for after-school programs for kids and preventive programs to keep kids out of trouble in the first place.

{"id": 6132, "text": "So we passed the bill with 100,000 police officers and with tougher punishment where appropriate, but with prevention measures and with the assault weapons ban. And 5 years later, we have had 5 years of steeply dropping crime, and the murder rate has dropped 22 percent in the last 3 years in this country. Now, you know here in Denver you have just been through it the crime rate is still too high, and there is still too much violence in this country. But we are going in the right direction. And that happened because of a political choice the American people made, and they knew how to make it in part because they heard the messages of the competing candidates. And we had a huge fight about it. In welfare, the same thing is true. I did not mind letting the States set the level of assistance to people on welfare because they had been, in effect, doing that for 25 years anyway. Before I ever signed the welfare reform law, there was a difference of more than 4 to one more than 4 to one between what a family on welfare could get in the State where the benefits were the lowest and the State where the benefits were the highest 3 1/2 to one. I do not want to overexaggerate3 1/2 to one. I just redid the math in my head. And I had no problem in requiring people who are on welfare who are able-bodied and able-minded to go to work. I thought that was important, because we were talking around our table half the welfare caseload was becoming people who were just permanently on welfare, almost, and sometimes intergenerationally. And that has nothing to do with compassion. You are not being compassionate when you leave people in a position of dependency when they do not have to be there. On the other hand, it is important, it seemed to me, when you require people who can work to work, not to ask them to hurt their children in doing it. After all, the biggest problem working families have today, many working families, is balancing the demand of taking care of their kids and taking care of their job. And I hear people even with very comfortable income levels, when they are honest, say they feel conflicts between their obligations to their children and their obligations at work.

{"id": 6133, "text": "So why should we expect people on welfare to sacrifice the most important job of society to do what is the most important job, arguably, in the short run to give them the self-respect and the independence they need to contribute to our common welfare? So I vetoed two bills because they took away medical care and nutrition for kids and they did not give enough money for child care and because I wanted more money to put people to work in high unemployment areas. Once we resolved those things, I signed that bill. We had the biggest drop in welfare rolls in history, 3.8 million fewer people on welfare than the day I became ENTITY. So we are moving in the right direction. And we proved you could grow the economy and improve the environment at the same time. Now we have to prove we can do that with greenhouse gas emissions to deal with the climate change issue. There is no question, if you just look at the evidence, that we can do it. So what I want you to know is that every time you see something like that that is good, that is a product of a choice because we had a fight about all those issues. We had an honest debate, a partisan debate about these issues. In this last year we passed a balanced budget agreement that had overwhelming bipartisan support, but there were elements that our side brought to it. We said, okay, we want to balance the budget, and we do not mind giving families the tax cut; we do not mind giving businesses the tax cut if we invest properly in giving all Americans access to college we want tax breaks for that; we want to spend some money to provide health insurance coverage to the children of working families who do not have it. We have got enough money for 5 million more kids to get health insurance in working families with low incomes. That is half the uninsured kids in the country. And we got the biggest new investment in education since 1965. That was because of choices that we made in Washington that the people who were there would not have been able to make if you had not helped us get there. There is a direct connection between your presence here and the things that are in that budget. And just this last week let me just close with this I had a week it was a killer of a week.

So we had to strike all those balances. Well, the public interest side of that a lot of that work over the last 2 years came from people that you helped to elect and from attitudes that you helped to advance. I signed a bill dramatically overhauling the foster care and adoption procedures and clearing away a lot of the obstacles to quicker adoption, even for children that have serious health problems. And my wife has worked on these subjects for 25 years. And all these advocates from all over the country came in, and I met a family that had adopted 20 children, including 3 of them who were wheelchair-bound. And to see these people who care about these kids you know, just last year we put in a $5,000 tax credit for adoption. But you need to know we all talk about how we believe in family values there are hundreds of thousands of kids out there that need a home that are trapped in a foster care system. And one of my staff members after it was over came up to me with tears in his eyes the guy has nothing to do with the human services area he came up to me, and he had tears in his eyes and said, I just want you to know that I spent 9 years of my childhood in one foster home after another. And this is going to change entire lives for people. And then I went to Wichita, Kansas, to the Cessna plant and saw what that company is doing to take hardcore welfare recipients and put them through training programs and guarantee them jobs. And a lot of these women have been severely beaten by their spouses or partners, have no money, are high school dropouts. Cessna provides housing, a 3-month training program, a 3-month pre-job program, and a guaranteed job for anybody who can finish. And I saw people speaking they had two of these women speaking.

First of all, I think it is important that we are the economic leader of the world, because when you are the leader, it helps the folks who live in your country. See, it matters if we are on the cutting edge of change. It matters to people working every day in America if we are creating strong economic growth. Today, we are creating strong economic growth. I mean, this economy of ours is moving forward with a full head of steam fifth year in a row of uninterrupted growth Our economy grew faster than any other major industrialized nation in the world. We added 5.2 million new jobs since August of 2003. A productive society will yield a higher standard of living for our people. Hourly compensation grew at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the first quarter of this year. Our workers are taking bigger home bigger paychecks. The standard of living is on the rise. After-tax income is up. And the fundamental question is, can you keep them that way, see? And there is a lot of competition in the world that creates some uncertainty and anxiety amongst our people. And the temptation for some is to say, Well, we cannot compete anymore so let us protect ourselves and let us withdraw; let us become isolationists.

First, if we want to be the economic leader in the world so our people can prosper, we need to keep taxes low. We need to be able to be a society that says, you get to earn more of that which you earn. As you might recall, we went through a pretty tough time in this country over the past 5 years. We had a recession, corporate scandals, a stock market correction, a attack on our country. We went to war to defend ourselves; we have had high energy prices; and we had natural disasters. And yet this economy of ours is strong. And I believe the reason why is, is because of the tax cuts we passed in Washington, DC. We believe that if you have more money in your pocket to save, spend, or invest, the economy grows. And so one way to make sure that we are the economic leader in the world is to make sure the tax cuts we passed are permanent. Now, people say, Well, if you make the tax cuts permanent, you cannot balance the budget. I have been there long enough to be able to give you an accurate report. Do not believe it when they say they are going to raise your taxes to balance the budget. They are going to raise your taxes and figure out new ways to spend the money. The best way to balance the budget is to keep progrowth economic policies in place. And, by the way, last year, because our economy was growing, we generated $100 billion more for the Treasury than we thought. And this year, because of the economy growing strong, we are generating better rates than we did last year. And so the best way to balance the budget is to keep growing the economy so we collect more tax revenues and be wise about spending your money. See, in Washington, everything sounds good there; every program sounds fantastic. But Government, in order to be wise about spending your money, has got to learn to set priorities. So long as we have a soldier in harm's way, he or she will have what it takes to achieve victory and secure America. We are on our way to cutting the deficit in half by 2009.

And if they exceed the $92.2 billion request, plus monies for avian flu, I am going to veto the bill. See, that is one way you keep fiscal discipline in Washington, DC. We will be competitive if we keep taxes low and be wise about how we spend your money. We will be competitive, by the way, if we are smart about improving education for our people. See, this is a global economy, whether people like it or not. And the jobs of the 21st century will be either here in America or wherever the workforce is trained to fill those jobs. And therefore, it is important for us to make sure we educate our children early and emphasize math and science so our kids have got the skills necessary to fill those jobs. We changed how we view public education in Washington. We passed the No Child Left Behind Act, see. Are you meeting objectives, for example? If you set a goal, are you meeting those goals? How about every child learning to read at grade level by the third grade? That did not seem like an unrealistic goal to me. As a matter of fact, it was a necessary goal. And then we said to the States, you measure. We are going to get you some money, but you measure to show us whether or not we are meeting the goal. And if you are not meeting the goal, figure out why. See, you cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem. And so the No Child Left Behind Act basically says, we are going to diagnose problems early and solve them, before it is too late. This business about shuffling kids through the school through our schools, based upon age, did not work. And so the No Child Left Behind Act says, we are going to measure early, and we are going to help children who have fallen behind in reading early, and then we are going to extend that to math. See, one of the interesting things is because we measure, we know that we are doing fine in math in the eighth grade. But children get to high school relative to other countries, we are not doing fine in math. And we better do something about it now if we want to be the economic leader of the world. So we have got a plan to, one, make sure the same standards applied to reading for early grades are applied to math.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksenergypottstownpennsylvania", "title": "Remarks on Energy in Pottstown, Pennsylvania", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-energy-pottstown-pennsylvania", "publication_date": "24-05-2006", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

I bet I am looking at some folks out here who took AP when they were in high school. AP means high standards. But we do not have enough teachers around the country to teach AP, so we have got a plan to train 70,000 Advanced Placement teachers to keep raising those standards. We want to have 30,000 adjunct professors in our classrooms in high school and junior sometimes it is not cool to be involved with science and yet it is cool. And we need people who are on the frontlines of science explaining that. I went to a school in Maryland the other day, and there was a NASA scientist there, explaining to junior high kids why the sciences matter and why it is fun to be in science. We are going to make sure our Pell grants which, by the way, have expanded by a million kids since I have been the President continue to have incentives in there for children to take rigorous academics coming out of high school and the first 2 years of college, and then if they maintain a 3.0 average or are taking math, science, or critical language, there is an additional $4,000 on top of their Pell grant. In other words, this is an effort to make sure that we have a workforce that can compete in a global economy so we remain the economic leader of the world. I want to talk about energy, see. If we do not get it right in energy, we can have the most educated workforce in the world, but we are not going to be able to compete. We can have the lowest taxes in the world, the least regulations, the fewest lawsuits, but if we have not done something about our energy situation, we are not going to be able to compete in the world. And so that is why I have come to this important powerplant, to talk about how the United States can have a diversified energy policy that makes us less dependent on foreign sources of oil and more dependent on renewable sources of energy. Now, one of the things I want to start off by telling the telling you all, and I hope others are listening, is that over the past 30 years, our economy has grown three times faster than our energy consumption. In other words, we are becoming more technologically advanced.

{"id": 6140, "text": "So what I believe the American people should understand is that we can put policies in place that encourage economic growth so you have got a better standard of living and, at the same time, become less dependent on energy from overseas and protect the environment. So what do we need to do? Well, the first thing we got to do is understand that we have got to change our driving habits over time. You have seen the price of gasoline going up. One of the reasons why your price of gasoline is going up is because demand for oil is increasing in places like India and China, and the supply for oil is not meeting that demand. And the key ingredient for gasoline is crude oil. So when the Chinese economy is growing or the Indian economy is growing, and that demand is going up, so is your price at the pump. One way to make sure the price at the pump does not go up as global demand increases for hydrocarbons is to figure out how to drive our cars with different kinds of fuels, such as ethanol. One of the really interesting developments that is taking place now in America is the use of corn-based ethanol pretty cool deal, is not it, for the President to be able to say, you know, we are growing a lot of corn and we are less dependent on foreign sources of oil. It is coming particularly in the Midwest right now, there is a lot of ethanol pumps and plants being developed there to manufacture ethanol from corn. We have got to do more, though, if we are going to become less dependent on foreign sources of oil, when it comes to ethanol. And so we are spending a lot of your money to develop technologies that will enable us to be able to manufacture ethanol from wood chips or switchgrass. I said, Well, it is grass that looks like a switch that grows in dry country. In other words, there is all kinds of opportunities to manufacture ethanol, and we are exploring ways to do so. America has always been on the leading edge of technology and research and development, and here is an area where we have got to stay on the leading edge of change. Another way to help reduce our use of gasoline is through hybrid vehicles. They are coming; they are coming on the market. As a matter of fact, the energy bill I signed actually will pay you give you a tax credit if you buy a hybrid. We are trying to stimulate demand through the Tax Code. It makes sense.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksenergypottstownpennsylvania", "title": "Remarks on Energy in Pottstown, Pennsylvania", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-energy-pottstown-pennsylvania", "publication_date": "24-05-2006", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 6141, "text": "But there is going to be an additional breakthrough or additional breakthroughs when it comes to hybrid vehicles, starting with the development of a battery that will enable you to drive your first 40 miles on electricity. And the Federal Government is very much involved in this research. We are spending your money, again, on research to help fund breakthroughs for battery technologies that will enable you to drive a plug-in hybrid battery. And, oh, by the way, on ethanol, just one thing I forgot to tell you is that there are 5 million flex-fuel vehicles on the road today. Flex-fuel means you can either have gasoline or ethanol or a combination of the two. You have probably got one and you do not even know it. The technology the barrier to change is not the automobile; it is the ability to make the fuel in quantities economic quantities so we can get them to you at the pump. And same with hybrid batteries; they are coming. Hybrid, plug-in hybrid vehicles with new batteries, they are coming your way. And one of the reasons why is because the Government has entered into research partnerships with the private sector to accelerate these technologies, all aimed at making us less dependent on oil. A third way to help this country remain an economic leader when it comes to the cars you drive is hydrogen. We spend about a over a billion dollars of research to bring hydrogen to the marketplace. One fellow reminded me, wisely, it costs it takes quite a bit of power to make hydrogen. An interesting way to make hydrogen on an economic basis would be through nuclear power, see. But we are spending money and time and effort, all aimed at making sure that the automobiles of the future will require less crude oil. And we are close to some significant breakthroughs. It is going to take time to move away from the hydrocarbon economy to the hydrogen economy, and in the meantime, it seems like it makes sense to me to do something about the refinery capacity of the United States. Like, if you are worried about the price of gasoline you do not like it when your price got over $3 and I do not blame you you might want to ask the question, how come the Government is not working hard to expand refinery capacity so that there is more gasoline? If you have more gasoline on the market relative to demand, guess what it takes the pressure off price. We have not built a new refinery in the United States since the 1970s.

I suggested to Congress that we put new refineries on abandoned military facilities. It seemed to make sense to me. And so we need to be wise about these policies so that we can say to the American people, we are on our way out of the hydrocarbon era. But in the meantime, let us be thoughtful of the consumers here in the United States. We are also going to need a lot of electricity in the future. Electricity demand is projected to increase by nearly 50 percent over the next 25 years. And we better be wise about how we implement a strategy to meet that demand; otherwise, we are not going to be the economic leader; otherwise, our people are not going to be having the good jobs that we want them to have; otherwise, your children and my children, our grandchildren are not going to have the bright, hopeful America that we want for them. coal it is about 50 percent; nuclear power about 20 percent; natural gas 18 percent; and then other renewable sources like hydroelectric, solar, and wind power. We got about 240 years at current rates of consumption. It is a valuable asset for the United States. The problem is, coal is not when you burn it, it is not clean. It does not meet our standards. It is not it does not enable us to say, you can grow your economy and, at the same time, protect the environment like we want. And so we are developing clean coal technology. We are spending over $2 billion in a 10-year period to be able to say to the American people that we are using the money wisely to determine whether or not we can have zero-emissions coal-fired powerplants. It is in our interests that we do that. It makes sense. About 2012, under the FutureGen Initiative, we think we will build the first powerplant to run on coal and remove virtually all pollutants. By the way, we can explore for natural gas in environmentally friendly ways.

If we are really interested in diversifying our energy sources and making sure the American people have got enough energy to watch this economy grow, we have got to have LNG sites to offload the gas from abroad. And so what we have done is, I signed a new bill, energy bill, that clarifies Federal authority to license new sites, that reduces the bureaucratic obstacles to opening up the terminals and streamlines the development. It is in your interest that we enable liquefied natural gas to come into our country so that we can help take the burden off some of the pricing pressures that we are inevitably going to feel with demand going up and not enough electricity supply. Thirdly, about 6 percent of the continental U.S. is highly suitable for the construction of wind turbines.

They say the experts tell me that this area alone has the potential to supply up to 20 percent of our Nation's electricity. I do not know if it is true or not, but it is certainly worth trying to find out, in order to make sure this country has got a bright future. And so we got $44 million for wind energy research. And the goal is to expand the use and lower the cost of wind turbine technology. In other words, we are constantly researching and looking. I do not know if you know this or not, but the Federal Government does spend money on research in a variety of fronts, and it should. And I intend to double the basic the budget for basic research over the next 10 years. The iPod like, I like to ride my mountain bike and plug in the iPod.

It is possible, but it is not going to be possible if we do not spend money on research and development. So we are spending $150 million to combine Government money with private research money in solar technologies to see if we cannot help foster technologies that will be able to capture the sun, feed it into your house, generate enough electricity, and if you have got a little excess, feed it back into the grid. Finally, I want to talk about nuclear power a subject you all are very familiar with. It is a really important way to meet our goals, which is to have abundant, affordable, clean, and safe sources of energy. In other words, you have nuclear powerplants, you can say, we have got an abundant amount of electricity. And once you get the plant up and running, the operating costs of these plants are significantly lower than other forms of electricity plants, which means the energy is affordable. As I mentioned, nuclear power it is the second leading source of electricity here. We have 100 nuclear powerplants that operate in 31 States. Now, we have not built one in a long period of time. People in our country are rightly concerned about greenhouse gases and the environment, and I can understand why; I am too. As a matter of fact, I try to tell people, let us quit the debate about whether greenhouse gases are caused by mankind or by natural causes; let us just focus on technologies that deal with the issue. Nuclear power will help us deal with the issue of greenhouse gases. Without nuclear energy, carbon dioxide emissions would have been 28 percent greater in the electricity industry in 2004. Without nuclear power, we would have had an additional 700 million tons a year of carbon dioxide, and that is nearly equal to the annual emissions from 136 million passenger cars. Nuclear power helps us protect the environment. It is safe because of advances in science and engineering and plant design. It is safe because the workers and managers of our nuclear powerplants are incredibly skilled people who know what they are doing. For the sake of economic security and national security, the United States of America must aggressively move forward with the construction of nuclear power-plants. Interestingly enough, France has built 58 plants since the 1970s and now gets 78 percent of its electricity from nuclear power.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksenergypottstownpennsylvania", "title": "Remarks on Energy in Pottstown, Pennsylvania", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-energy-pottstown-pennsylvania", "publication_date": "24-05-2006", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

And 78 percent of their electricity comes from nuclear power. They worry about it, but they do not have to worry about it to the extent that we do. China has 9 nuclear plants in operation, and they got plan to build 40 more over the next two decades. They understand that in order to be an aggressive nation, an economic nation that is flourishing so their people can benefit, they better do something about their sources of electricity. They see it. India I just came from India they are going to build some nuclear powerplants. To maintain our economic leadership, we got to do it again. First, in the energy bill I signed in 2005, there are loan guarantees, production tax credits, Federal risk insurance for the builders of new plants. In other words, we said, this is an industry that had not got much going since the seventies. It is highly risky because of the regulations to try to build a plant. People do not know this, but you get yourself a design for a nuclear powerplant; you start spending money for plans and engineering plans and everything; you get building; and all of the sudden, somebody can shut you down. And that makes it awfully difficult to take risk, if a lawsuit can cause you to spend enormous sums of money and have no productive use of the money spent. And so we got together with the Congress and said, Well, how what can we do to create incentives to show the industry that we are serious about moving forward? Well, one is loan guarantees, and that gives investors confidence that this Government is committed to the construction of nuclear powerplants. Secondly is production tax credits, and those credits will reward investments in the latest advanced nuclear power generation. In other words, there is incentives loan guarantee is an incentive, tax credits are incentives, Federal risk insurance. What the Federal risk insurance says is offered for the first six new powerplant nuclear powerplants. And the insurance helps protect builders of the plants against lawsuits or bureaucratic obstacles and other delays beyond their control. We have got what is called the Nuclear Power 2010 Initiative, which is a $1.1 billion partnership between the Federal Government and the industry to facilitate new plant orders. In other words, I have said, we need more nuclear powerplants, and here is a strategy to get them going, see. Here is a way to say to the industry, we are serious about this.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksenergypottstownpennsylvania", "title": "Remarks on Energy in Pottstown, Pennsylvania", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-energy-pottstown-pennsylvania", "publication_date": "24-05-2006", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

Now 16 companies have expressed an interest in new construction, and they are considering as many as 25 new plants, trying to get these plants construction started by the end of this decade. I want it to be said that this generation of folks had the foresight necessary to diversify our or to continue to diversify electricity supply and recognize that nuclear power is safe, and we did something about it. We just did not mark our time. We actually did something about it so a generation of Americans coming up will be able to have a better America. I understand the issue of waste, and we have got to do something about it. We have got to be wise about nuclear waste. I am a believer that Yucca Mountain is a scientifically sound place to send the waste, and I would hope that the United States Congress would recognize that as well. I also recognize that we can do something on a reprocessing front. And so I got our administration to commit to the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership. Under the partnership, America is going to work with nations that have already got an advanced civilian nuclear energy program, such as France and Japan and Russia, and we are going to use new technologies that effectively and safely recycle spent nuclear fuel. In other words, we are coming together to say, how can we do a better job of reprocessing and recycling fuel? And the reason that is important, at least for our fellow citizens to understand, is it will reduce the amount of the toxicity of the fuel and reduce the amount we have to store. To me, it is a smart way to combine with others to reduce storage requirements for nuclear waste by up to 90 percent. It is a good way to work with other nations that are spending money on research and development as well. It is a way to, kind of, leverage up an investment. We are going to I have asked Congress to spend $250 million on this partnership. I hope they follow through with it. It is a necessary expenditure of money to make sure that the nuclear power industry can move forward with confidence, and the American people move forward with confidence as well. And so here are some ideas not only ideas; this is what we are doing; this has gone from idea to action. What I am telling you is, is that I understand the need to get off oil.

Jack Vessey always remembered the soldiers in the ranks; he understood those soldiers are the backbone of any army. He noticed them, spoke to them, looked out for them. Jack Vessey never forgot what it was like to be an enlisted man, to be just a GI. Mark J. Neal, of Las Cruces, New Mexico, remembers. In January of 1975, he was a private at Fort Carson, a member of the drill team there. He said recently that after one drill team event, he was in his residence doing dishes before the volunteer army, way back when Jack and I enlisted, it seems to me they had another name for doing dishes. Anyway, Mark Neal was told the commanding general wanted to see him. He was scared, of course, but he found his meeting and friendly chat with the general something he would always remember. After that, Mark Neal followed General Vessey's career. This short meeting made a lasting impression on me. It was amazing to me that you even knew I was on the premises... even more amazing that you would want to meet me. That moment of thoughtfulness for a lonely enlisted man back at Fort Carson proved the truth of your reputation as a real soldier's general. There were many Mark Neals in Jack Vessey's career, and Jack Vessey made their lives a little easier, a little less lonely. And he made them a little prouder to wear their country's uniform and defend freedom. Jack, in the 5 years or so that I have been doing events like this, I have learned something about people like you. A career like yours, combining as it does heroism, patriotism, competence, wisdom, and kindness, does not need elaboration from commanders in chief or President; it speaks enough all by itself. But what I can do today is thank you. On behalf of your friends here today who've had the honor of working with you and on behalf of some others who could not be here all your fellow Americans, if they had the chance to be here, they would express their gratitude to you for making their lives and the lives of their children safer and more secure.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfarewellceremonyforgeneraljohnwvesseyjrchairmanthejointchiefsstaff", "title": "Remarks at a Farewell Ceremony for General John W.

Thus far, we have frozen $6 million in bank accounts linked to terrorist activity. We have frozen 30 Al Qaida accounts in the United States and 20 overseas. Also, on the military front, we are making progress. We have deployed 29,000 military personnel and 2 carrier battle groups, as well as an amphibious-ready group and several hundred military aircraft. We have called about 17,000 members of the reserve to active duty, as well as several thousand National Guard operating under State authority. As I said, this is a different kind of war. It is hard to fight a guerrilla war with conventional forces. And as I said to the Congress, they will make us proud. In this new kind of war, one that requires a coalition, we are making good progress on the diplomatic front. At our request, the United Nations unanimously enacted a binding resolution requiring all its members to deny financing support or safe harbor to terrorists. We have had 46 declarations of support from organizations including NATO, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, and the Organization of American States. And slowly but surely, we are going to make sure they have no place to hide. Slowly but surely, we are going to move them out of their holes and what they think is safe havens and get them on the move. We are a nation who has got a long-term view, a nation that is come to realize that in order to make freedom prevail, the evildoers will be forced to run and will eventually be brought to justice. Now, along those lines, we are taking any threat seriously here at home. The FBI has conducted hundreds of interviews and searches, issued hundreds of subpoenas, and arrested or detained more than 400 people as it investigates the attacks.

We are slowly but surely calling their hand and reining them in. And along these lines, this weekend, through the collaborative efforts of intelligence and law enforcement, we have arrested a known terrorist who was responsible for the deaths of two U.S. citizens during a hijacking in 1986, a terrorist by the name of Zayd Hassan Safarini. He is not affiliated with Al Qaida, yet he is an example of the wider war on terrorism and what we intend to do. Here is a man who killed two of our own citizens when he hijacked a plane in Pakistan. By the way, obviously, there is only two Americans that is two too many but there was a lot of people from other countries, as well, involved. And he was convicted and sentenced to death, yet he only served 14 years. Well, we arrested him; we got him; we brought him into Alaska.

{"id": 6155, "text": "The cost of health care is rising rapidly, and that burdens our families. It hurts our small businesses. It makes it harder for the job creators to expand the job base. Too many Americans are left struggling to find affordable health care. And so I think we need to take practical steps to make sure this health care system of ours is more affordable and available, and we have got to take those steps this year. To improve health care in America, we need to expand the use of health savings accounts. It is a product that lets you save tax-free for routine medical care while keeping affordable coverage against major illness. Small businesses must be allowed to join together, to pool risk so they can buy insurance for their employees at the same discounts that big businesses are able to do. To address the cost of medical care, we need to apply 21st century information technology to the health care field. We need to have our medical records put on the IT. We need to make sure that we speed up the delivery and arrival of cheaper generic drugs to help control costs. We want to make sure our Medicare system still allows seniors to have choice in the system. We have got to make sure we expand community health centers around our country to provide care for the poor and the indigent. And we have got to make sure low-income children are enrolled in government health care programs so they receive the care they need. These are practical steps to help people be able to find health care at affordable prices and, at the same time, make sure the health care system is not run by the Federal Government but by patients and doctors. To make sure our health care system works the way we want it to work, we have got to address the root causes of rising medical costs. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing information technology. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing generic drugs faster, just like I mentioned. Some of the cost increases in our health care system are necessary and worthwhile. After all, research into new treatments requires major investments. In other words, to stay on the leading edge of medicine, it costs money. And I suspect somebody whose life has been saved by the latest technology is going to say that cost increase was necessary. And that is what the American people must understand and Members of the United States Senate and the United States House must understand.

{"id": 6156, "text": "What is happening all across this country is that lawyers are filing baseless suits against hospitals and doctors. They know the medical liability system is tilted in their favor. Jury awards in medical liability cases have skyrocketed in recent years. That means every claim filed by a personal-injury lawyer brings the chance of a huge payoff or a profitable settlement out of court. That is what that means. Doctors and hospitals realize this. They know it is expensive to fight a lawsuit, even if it does not have any merit. And because the system is so unpredictable, there is a constant risk of being hit by a massive jury award. So doctors end up paying tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle claims out of court, even when they know they have done nothing wrong. That is what is happening in the system today. It is costly for the doctors. It is costly for small businesses. It is costly for hospitals. It is really costly for patients. When those providing insurance have to pay the bills for enormous jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements, they have to raise premiums on physicians they cover. Specialists in high-risk practices like ob-gyn or neurosurgery are particularly vulnerable to lawsuits, so their premiums rise the fastest. You are about to hear a couple of stories of folks in this area who can testify to that fact. Because junk lawsuits are so unpredictable, they drive up insurance costs for all doctors, even for those who have never been sued, even for those who have never had a claim against them. When insurance premiums rise, doctors have no choice but to pass some of the costs on to their patients. That means you are paying for junk lawsuits every time you go to see your doctor. That is the effect of all the lawsuits. It affects your wallet. If you are a patient, it means you are paying a higher cost to go see your doctor. If part of the national strategy has got to be to make sure health care is available and affordable, health care becomes less affordable because of junk lawsuits. And that is what the people of southern Illinois and the people of America must understand, that every time you read about big jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements or lawsuits being filed here or there, you are paying for it. give up medicine entirely, or to move to another place where they can afford to practice medicine.

Over the past 2 years, the liability crisis has forced out about 160 physicians in Madison and St. Clair counties alone. the patients, the people who live in these good towns in this part of the world. Pregnant women have to travel longer distances for checkups. Accident victims lose critical minutes in transit to faraway emergency rooms. New residents, people you are trying to get to come and live in your communities, have a hard time finding doctors willing to accept extra patients. And that causes the quality of life in your community to deteriorate. It is a problem that we must address. America's health care professionals should be focused on fighting illnesses, not on fighting lawsuits. Junk lawsuits change the way docs do their job. Instead of trying to heal the patients, doctors try not to get sued. Makes sense, does not it? If you are worried about getting sued, you are going to do everything you can to make sure you do not get sued. That means they are writing prescriptions or ordering tests that really are not necessary, just to reduce the potential of a future lawsuit. They have specialists who stop taking emergency room calls. Doctors turn away patients with complicated, life-threatening conditions because they carry the highest risk for a lawsuit. Defensive medicine drives a wedge between the doctors and the patients, and defensive medicine is incredibly costly for our society. Altogether, defensive medicine drains some 60 to 100 billion dollars from the economy. Defensive medicine raises medical bills for patients and increases insurance costs for employers, and it takes money away that small businesses could use to invest and expand. This liability system of ours is, what I am telling you, is out of control. And you have people in this area and the doctors in this area understand what I am talking about. A recent study ranked Madison County the number one place in the country for trial lawyers to sue. And those of you traveling in from St. Clair County are not doing much better. Clair is ranked the second county in America where you are likely to get sued. In other words, if you see a team of trial lawyers spending a lot of time in the Collinsville area, you can be pretty sure they are not looking for horseradish.

A few years ago, Chris decided that closing his head trauma part of his practice was the only way he could afford to stay in this area. He told me he loves living here in this part of the world. He likes to raise his family here. He and his wife made a tough decision to stay here, in spite of the fact that his premiums doubled and he got half the coverage. And so the only way he could stay here and to provide a level of care that he wants everybody to have was to cut out part of his practice. He still treats dozens of patients with spinal cord injuries, but now brain trauma victims in southern Illinois have to be airlifted across the river to St. Louis. I spent years of training to do brain surgery. It is a big part of my life. I made a commitment to stay here, but I had to make adjustments to keep the ax from falling. Greg Gabliani is with us.

He said, You either have to change the nature of your practice, or you have to leave. He did not want to leave, so he is having to cut back on his services. We have got a problem, folks.

This is a story of pregnant moms all over America who are wondering whether or not they are going to be able to find good quality health care for their child and themselves. I have come to this part of the world because I want to assure you that, one, I understand the problem and I intend to work with Congress to do something about it. You know, when I was the Governor of Texas, I felt that we could solve medical liability issues at the State level. One is that a State would pass good medical liability reform, and all the trial lawyers would do is go to the State that has lousy medical liability law. So you are not solving the problem, you are just shifting the problem. You are making the quality of life issue go from one area the deterioration of quality of life issue go from one area to the next. That did not seem to make any sense. But the other thing I discovered is that because of medical liability problems and lawsuits and increasing premiums and the defensive practice of medicine, your Federal budget spends $28 billion a year, extra money. See, we have to pay for Medicaid and Medicare and veterans' benefits. The rising cost of health care, the number of lawsuits, the defensive practice of medicine is driving up the cost to our taxpayers. Medical liability reform is a national issue, and it requires a national solution. So I went to Congress with some proposals that I think are fair, proposals that will build confidence in the judicial system. Nobody likes to come to a part of the world that says the judicial system is out of control, and people lose confidence in it. We have got to have confidence in the fairness of our system. We want people who are harmed to be able to get have their day in court and get fair treatment in the courts of law. But we want we do not want a system that is so tilted the other way that it runs good doctors out of business and makes it hard for hospitals to deliver care. I believe a victim of a legitimate medical error should be allowed to collect full economic damages, 100 percent of the cost of their medical care and recovery plus economic losses for the rest of their life. And when appropriate, injured people should be allowed to collect reasonable noneconomic damages.

{"id": 6161, "text": "But there needs to be some reason when it comes to noneconomic damages in the system, and that is why I proposed a hard cap of $250,000 on noneconomic damages. Interestingly enough, the State of California has a cap on noneconomic damages that was enacted in 1975. Patients in that State see their claims settled a third faster than in States without those limits. In other words, patients are treated more fairly where there is a cap. And since 1975, insurance premiums for California doctors have become much more affordable premiums than anywhere else in the country than in most States. Caps on noneconomic damages work. It is a good idea, and the Congress ought to adopt them. We have another problem with our legal system, and that is trial lawyers sometimes sue all the doctors involved in the patient's case even if most of the doctors have nothing to do with the patient's injuries. It is simply unfair to punish doctors who have done nothing wrong. And so to make sure doctors and hospitals are treated fairly, Congress needs to pass joint and several liability reform. I think the people are beginning to understand the importance of this issue. 160 docs leave 2 counties. People understand that no patient has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit; no small business has ever grown because of a frivolous lawsuit; the cause of justice is never served by frivolous lawsuit. I know you are serious about this liability issue here. I talked about it everywhere I went on the campaign nearly everywhere I went on the campaign trail, and I believe the voters made their position clear on election day about medical liability. The House passed a good medical liability reform bill last year. I want to thank the two Members of Congress for working on it. We have got a new chance to get something done for the on behalf of the American people. Both Houses will have a fresh opportunity to address this issue. I am looking forward to working with the leadership of the House to get the bill moving. It is important for the United States Senators from this State and other States to recognize the significance of the problem and get a meaningful, real medical liability bill to my desk so I can sign it in the year 2005. Junk lawsuits affect more than just the medical field. According to a recent study, frivolous litigation has helped drive the total cost of our tort system to more than $230 billion a year.

{"id": 6162, "text": "The lawsuit burden falls especially hard on small businesses. And yet small businesses are the engine of job are the engines of job creation in our country. Seventy percent of all new jobs in America are created by small businesses. The tort costs in America are now far higher than in any other major industrialized nation. We live in a competitive world. This is a global economy, and so our tort system has become a needless disadvantage for American manufacturers and entrepreneurs. To protect small businesses and workers, we need to change the way we handle class-action lawsuits. Interestingly enough, this is another problem you know well in Madison County. The number of class actions filed here increased by over 5,000 percent between 1998 and 2003, even though the vast majority of defendants named in those suits are not actually from Madison County. These massive interstate class actions clog your local courts. They hurt the honest workers and communities of the businesses targeted by the class-action lawyers. The proper place for large interstate class actions to be tried is not in a local court but rather in a Federal court, which are designed . I look forward to working with both bodies and members of both parties to get good class-action reform out of the Congress this year. I will also work with Congress to reform asbestos litigation. Asbestos lawsuits in southern Illinois and elsewhere have led to the bankruptcy of dozens of companies and cost tens of thousands of jobs. Many asbestos claims are filed on behalf of people who are not sick. The volume of asbestos lawsuits is beyond the capacity of our courts to handle, and it is growing. Congress has begun considering options to improve the current system for handling asbestos lawsuits. I look forward to signing an asbestos reform in 2005. I think we are sent to Washington to solve problems, not to pass them on to future Congresses. I believe we are called to do the hard work to make our communities and quality of life a better place. And it is hard work for some in Congress to stand up to the trial lawyers. I understand that. And most of all, we want the patients and the American people treated fairly. And I appreciate you all giving me a chance to come by and talk about the vital issue of legal reform. I intend to go back to Washington here shortly, and when I see Members of the Congress as I work this issue, I am going to say, I spoke to the good folks of southern Illinois.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingdiscussionmedicalliabilityreformcollinsvilleillinois", "title": "Remarks Following a Discussion on Medical Liability Reform in Collinsville, Illinois", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-discussion-medical-liability-reform-collinsville-illinois", "publication_date": "05-01-2005", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

I had the opportunity to speak with President Karzai this morning, and I wanted to congratulate him on accepting the certification of the recent election. As we all know, this has been a very difficult time in Afghanistan, to not only carry out a election under difficult circumstances, where there were a whole host of security issues that had to be resolved, but also postelection, a lot of uncertainty. President Karzai, as well as the other candidates, I think have shown that they have the interest of the Afghan people at heart, that this is a reflection of a commitment to rule of law, and a insistence that the Afghan people's will should be done. And so I expressed the American people's appreciation for this step. You have violent forces opposed to democracy in Afghanistan. And yet despite these very difficult conditions, what we have seen is elections take place. We have now seen the IEC and the ECC in Afghanistan complete their work. We have seen the candidates expressing a willingness to abide by constitutional law, and there is a path forward in order to complete this election process. I want to give particular thanks to Ambassador Karl Eikenberry and his team, who have been working tirelessly throughout this process. I also want to commend Senator John Kerry, who was in the region traveling and ended up working extensively with Ambassador Eikenberry and was extraordinarily constructive and very helpful. So I think he deserves great congratulations. Moving forward, we will continue to work with our ISAF partners as well as the Afghan Government, however this election turns out, to ensure that we can move the Afghan that we can move Afghanistan towards peace and security and prosperity and that the will of the Afghan people is ultimately done. So we are pleased with the steps that have been taken today, and we hope that we can build on this progress. I finally want to thank the incredible work of our U.S. military and the young men and women who are stationed in Afghanistan who are doing so much to help bring about a more secure and prosperous and democratic Afghanistan.

But we did not just talk about military and security issues. What is wonderful about this trip is that it represents a transition in our bilateral relationship, so that we are moving now to issues beyond security and we are beginning to talk about economy, trade, commerce. The business and investment conference that is taking place is going to be very well attended. It includes not only Prime Minister Maliki but business leaders from both the United States and Iraq.

We have seen a collapse in the housing market, a precipitous drop in values, and that led to a lot of the problems in the financial markets. At the beginning of this administration, we said we are--we were going to tackle directly the problems that homeowners were experiencing and figure out ways in which we could provide them assistance in reducing their interest rates, modifying their loans so that they would be in a position to stay in their homes and reduce their monthly payments. And around the table here you see some wonderful families who have taken advantage of what are now historically low mortgage rates, brought about in part by some extraordinary actions by the Federal Reserve, but also brought about by the housing plan that Tim Geithner and Shaun Donovanhelped to design. What you have seen now is rates are as low as they have been since 1971. Three-quarters of the American people get their mortgages through a Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac qualified loan. And as a consequence of us being able to reduce the interest rates that are available, we have now seen some extraordinary jumps in the rate of mortgage refinancings. And everybody here represents families who have saved hundreds of dollars a month, thousands of dollars a year in some cases, and that is money directly in their pocket. More importantly, what it is allowed them to do is to consolidate their loans in some cases, reduce the length of their mortgages in other cases. It has given them the kind of security and stability in their mortgage payments that a lot more people can take advantage of.

Let me take just a few minutes to talk with you on a personal basis, to let you know of my personal concern for the needs of Indians and Native Americans. The Federal Government has a very unique relationship with you and your people. It is a relationship of a legal trust and a high moral responsibility. That relationship is rooted deep in history, but it is fed today by our concern that the Indian people should enjoy the same opportunities as other Americans, while maintaining the culture and the traditions that you rightly prize as your heritage. That heritage is an important part of the American culture that we are celebrating in this great country in our Bicentennial Year. Your ancestors introduced settlers not only to new foods and new plants but to Indian ways of life and Indian values which they absorbed. This is a year for all of us to realize what a great debt we individually and collectively owe to the American Indians. Today you are concerned about such serious problems as poverty, unemployment, crime, poor health, and unsuitable housing on Indian reservations. I share your concern. I am hopeful about the future and about what we can achieve by continuing to work together. The 1970's have brought a new era in Indian affairs. In the last century, Federal policy has vacillated between paternalism and the threat of terminating Federal responsibility. I am opposed to both extremes. I believe in maintaining a stable policy so that Indians and Indian leaders can plan and work confidently for the future. We can build on that foundation to improve the opportunities available to American Indians and, at the same time, make it possible for you to live as you choose within your tribal structure and in brotherhood with your fellow citizens.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmeetingwithamericanindianleaders", "title": "Remarks at a Meeting With American Indian Leaders", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-meeting-with-american-indian-leaders", "publication_date": "16-07-1976", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Gerald R.

{"id": 6169, "text": "My administration is supporting the concept of allowing Indian tribes to determine whether they and their members, in addition to being under tribal jurisdiction, should be under State or Federal civil and criminal jurisdiction. I have directed the Departments of Justice and Interior to draft legislation which would accomplish this goal efficiently, effectively, and within adequate guidelines. They have solicited the views of the Indian community in preparing their recommendations, which I will soon send to the Congress. I am committed to furthering the self-determination of Indian communities but without terminating the special relationship between the Federal Government and the Indian people. I am strongly opposed to termination. Self-determination means that you can decide the nature of your tribe's relationship with the Federal Government within the framework of the Self-Determination Act, which I signed in January of 1975. Indian tribes, if they desire, now have the opportunity to administer Federal programs for themselves. We can then work together as partners. On your part, this requires initiative and responsibility as you define your tribal goals and determine how you want to use the Federal resources. On the Federal Government's part, self-determination for Indian tribes requires that Federal programs must be flexible enough to deal with the different needs and desires of individual tribes. In the past, our flexibility has been limited by the lack of effective coordination among departments and agencies offering a wide variety of programs and services to the Indian people. Programs serving both reservation and nonreservation Indians are spread across half a dozen different Cabinet departments involving agencies ranging from the Economic Development Administration to the Federal Aviation Administration. As many of you know, this is Ted Marrs' last day on the White House staff. Ted's service as White House Liaison for Indian Affairs has been invaluable to me as ENTITY and to the Cabinet officers and, I am confident, to the Indian community. With his departure, I will announce shortly the name of a person who will assume Ted Marrs' duties in the Office of Public Liaison in the area of Indian affairs. This appointee will be an individual with responsibility to work with the Cabinet officers, with the Office of Management and Budget, with the Domestic Council, and with my legal office to encourage the improved coordination of the various Federal agencies and programs that currently serve the Indian population. As an additional step in this direction, I am also sending a memorandum to the heads of all Cabinet departments with Indian responsibilities, directing them to give priority attention to the coordination of Indian programs.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmeetingwithamericanindianleaders", "title": "Remarks at a Meeting With American Indian Leaders", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-meeting-with-american-indian-leaders", "publication_date": "16-07-1976", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Gerald R.

It creates new opportunities for our entrepreneurs. Trade expands choices for America's consumers and raises living standards for our families. And now, after 8 years, America is back in the business of promoting open trade to build our prosperity and to spur economic growth. I appreciate so very much Vice President Cheney's hard work on this issue. I appreciate Colin Powell and Ann Veneman, who ably serve in my Cabinet. I want to particularly thank Don Evans, who is not with us, and Bob Zoellick, members of my Cabinet who both worked tirelessly to get the vote in the House and then in the Senate, and I appreciate Elaine Chao as well. These Cabinet Secretaries worked hard for trade. They understand the promise of trade, and I appreciate their hard work on behalf of American workers and farmers. I particularly want to thank the Members of Congress who are here with us, starting with the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator from Montana, Max Baucus. Max did fantastic work to get this trade bill through the Senate and was then able to work with Chairman Thomas. Chairman Thomas was heroic in the House. He was steadfast in his support for trade, and I appreciate his leadership on this issue. And I want to thank both Members of the United States Congress, one Democrat, one Republican, who put their country ahead of their parties to do what was right for the people of this country.

I want to appreciate you-appreciate your hard work on sending the message of trade to Members of our Congress. I want to thank you for your diligence, and I want to thank your ENTITY for their care and concern about this incredibly important initiative, not only for Americans but for workers all around the world. With trade promotion authority, the trade agreements I negotiate will have an up-or-down vote in Congress, giving other countries the confidence to negotiate with us. Five Presidents before me had this advantage, but since the authority elapsed in 1994, other nations and regions have pursued new trade agreements while America's trade policy was stuck in park. With each passing day, America has lost trading opportunities and the jobs and earnings that go with them. Starting now, America is back at the bargaining table in full force. I will use trade promotion authority aggressively to create more good jobs for American workers, more exports for American farmers, and higher living standards for American families. Free trade has a proven track record for spurring growth and advancing opportunity for our working families. Exports accounted for roughly one-quarter of all U.S. economic growth in the 1990s. Jobs in exporting plants pay wages that are up to 18 percent higher than jobs in nonexporting plants. And our two major trade agreements, NAFTA and the Uruguay Round, have created more choices and lower prices for consumers while raising standards of living for the typical American family of four by $2,000 a year. America will build on this record of success. A completely free global market for agricultural products, for example, would result in gains of as much as $13 billion a year for American farmers and consumers. In other words, trade is good for the American people, and I am going to use the trade promotion authority to bring these benefits to the American people. Free trade is also a proven strategy for building global prosperity and adding to the momentum of political freedom. Trade is an engine of economic growth. It uses the power of markets to meet the needs of the poor. In our lifetime, trade has helped lift millions of people and whole nations and entire regions out of poverty and put them on the path to prosperity.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningthetradeact2002", "title": "Remarks on Signing the Trade Act of 2002", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-the-trade-act-2002", "publication_date": "06-08-2002", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

The Secretary of Transportation also plays an important role in our Nation's coordinated efforts to guard against terrorist threats to our aircraft, seaports, and infrastructure. For the past 6 years, these responsibilities have been carried out by Norm Mineta, who served our country with distinction, integrity, and dedication. Norm is our Nation's longest serving Secretary of Transportation, and he served at a time of great consequence for our country. I remember after the attacks of September the 11th, when Norm led the successful effort to bring tens of thousands of passengers aboard commercial aircraft to safe landings. He grounded quite a few planes, including the ones my mom and dad were on. They have always thanked you for that, Norm. After Hurricane Katrina, Norm and his team helped quickly repair and reopen the majorarea's major highways, airports, seaports, and pipelines.

She worked for several years with Secretary Mineta, and she understands the fine legacy she has to live up to. She also knows firsthand the skills and dedication of the men and women who work here at the Department of Transportation. She understands that to maintain our Nation's competitiveness and to sustain our growing economy, we need a Secretary who can see the challenges and be willing to confront them. Mary Peters will provide strong leadership. She has spent a lifetime working on transportation issues in both the private and public sectors. Most recently, she has served as senior executive for transportation policy at a major engineering firm. For 4 years before that, she led the Federal Highway Administration. Before coming to Washington, she served in the Arizona Department of Transportation. For more than 15 years, she rose through the ranks to become director in 1998. At both the State and Federal level, Mary Peters has worked to improve safety and security on roads and bridges. She is worked to reduce traffic congestion and modernize America's transportation infrastructure. As Secretary of Transportation, Mary will work closely with Federal, State, and local leaders to ensure that America has a state-of-the-art transportation system so that we can meet the needs of our growing economy. In her new position, she will face important challenges. Next year, she will lead the Department's efforts to reauthorize our Nation's aviation programs. Our Nation is outgrowing our aviation capacity. More people are flying every year, and so we must modernize our airports and our air traffic control. We also face the challenges of reducing congestion in our surface and maritime transportation systems. To accomplish these tasks, America needs creative thinking and innovative solutions, and I believe Mary Peters will provide them. As Mary works to build a better transportation system, she will be a careful steward of the people's money. She brings to her new position a reputation for fiscal discipline and integrity. As head of the Federal Highway Administration, Mary introduced better fiscal oversight and accountability. She improved management for the largest transportation projects.

The Advisory Commission that I announced today will help to chart our way through a time of profound change in health care. to find ways to ensure quality and to ensure that the rights of consumers in health care are protected. Since I took office, we have been committed to improving our health care system, to making it more affordable, more accessible, while preserving its high quality. You have heard Secretary Shalala mention some of the things we have done together. We have worked with States to expand Medicaid to more than 2 million Americans who previously had no insurance. We reached across party lines to enact the Kassebaum-Kennedy law that provides that working families will not lose their insurance when they change jobs, increased the health care tax deduction for 3 million self-employed Americans. And now in our budget plan, we have funds sufficiently targeted to extend coverage to as many as half of our 10 million American children who still do not have medical coverage. We have worked to constrain costs. Just yesterday, I announced a new effort to combat the multibillion dollar problem of fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid. Our balanced budget proposal also strengthens Medicare through savings and overdue structural reforms. Of course, we are not alone in this. The private sector has found ways to rein in costs, sometimes dramatically. And in many cases, changes in the health care delivery system have, frankly, also improved its quality. For example, the growing recognition of the value of preventive care, such as mammography screening, is saving and extending lives and the quality of life. Step by step we have been working to expand access to health care, and today we take the next step. In this time of transition, many Americans worry that lower costs mean lower quality and less attention to their rights. On balance, however, managed health care plans, HMO's, PPO's, and others, give patients good care and greater choice at lower cost. Still, we must make sure that these changes do not keep health professionals from offering the best and the most medically appropriate services to their patients.

That is why I decided late last year to establish the Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry. Today I am happy to introduce the members of that Commission to the American people. They represent consumers, business, labor, health care providers, insurers, managed care plans, State and local governments, health care quality experts.

This Commission includes some of the best health care policy minds in our Nation and a lot of people with hands-on experience. Today, to assure that they get busy right away, I am charging the Commission to develop a consumer bill of rights so that health care patients get the information and care they need when they need it. Let us assure that patients and their families-first, that the health care professionals who are treating them are free to provide the best medical advice available; second, that their providers are not subject to inappropriate financial incentives to limit care; third, that our sickest and most vulnerable patients, frequently the elderly and people with disabilities, are receiving the best medical care for their unique needs; fourth, that consumers have access to simple and fair procedures for resolving health care coverage disputes with plans; fifth, and perhaps most important, that consumers have basic information about their rights and responsibilities, about the plans-the benefits the plans offer, about how to access the health care they need, and about the quality of their providers and their health care plans. I am delighted that the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Labor will take on the task of being the Commission's Cochairs. I look forward to reviewing their first report at the end of the year and their final report next March. The need for this Commission is real.

His death is a great loss, not just for the Navy and our Armed Forces but for our entire country. Mike Boorda was the very first enlisted man in the history of our country to rise to become Chief of Naval Operations. He brought extraordinary energy and dedication and good humor to every post he held in a long and distinguished career. From Southeast Asia to Europe, he devoted his life to serving our Nation. I am personally grateful for the central role he played in planning our mission in Bosnia, both when he commanded our forces in southeastern Europe and later when he came here to Washington. He was known for his professionalism and skill. But what distinguished him above all else was his unwavering concern for the welfare of the men and women who serve the United States in our Navy. We will all remember him for that, and much else. Our hearts and prayers go out to his family, to his wife, Bettie, and his children, David, Edward, Anna, and Robert.

Boys and girls at play, farmers tending their fields, ordinary travelers-in all, more than 25,000 people a year are maimed or killed by mines left behind when wars ended. We must act so that the children of the world can walk without fear on the earth beneath them. To end this carnage, the United States will seek a worldwide agreement as soon as possible to end the use of all antipersonnel landmines. The United States will lead a global effort to eliminate these terrible weapons and to stop the enormous loss of human life. The steps I announced today build on the work we have done to clear mines in 14 nations, from Bosnia to Afghanistan, from Cambodia to Namibia.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheantipersonnellandminesinitiative", "title": "Remarks on the Antipersonnel Landmines Initiative", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-antipersonnel-landmines-initiative", "publication_date": "16-05-1996", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 6181, "text": "They build as well on the export moratorium on landmines we have observed for 4 years, an effort that, thankfully, 32 other nations have joined. To pursue our goal of a worldwide ban, today I order several unilateral actions. First, I am directing that effective immediately, our Armed Forces discontinue the use of all so-called dumb antipersonnel mines, those which remain active until detonated or cleared. The only exception will be for those mines required to defend our American troops and our allies from aggression on the Korean Peninsula and those needed for training purposes. The rest of these mines, more than 4 million in all, will be removed from our arsenals and destroyed by 1999. Just as the world has a responsibility to see to it that a child in Cambodia can walk to school in safety, as Commander in Chief, my responsibility is also to safeguard the safety, the lives of our men and women in uniform. Because of the continued and unique threat of aggression in the Korean Peninsula, I have therefore decided that in any negotiations on a ban, the United States will and must protect our rights to use the mines there. We will do so until the threat is ended or until alternatives to landmines become available. Until an international ban takes effect, the United States will reserve the right to use socalled smart mines or self-destructing mines as necessary, because there may be battlefield situations in which these will save lives of our soldiers. Let me emphasize, these smart mines are not the hidden killers that have caused so much suffering around the world. They meet standards set by international agreement. They destroy themselves within days, and they pose virtually no threat to civilian life once a battle is over. But under the comprehensive international ban we seek, use of even these smart antipersonnel mines would also be ended. We are determined that lands around the world will never again be sown with terror. That is why I will propose a resolution at the 51st United Nations General Assembly this fall, urging the nations of the world to support a worldwide ban on landmines. I have instructed Ambassador Albright to begin work now on this resolution. Third, while the exceptions I have mentioned are necessary to protect American lives, I am determined to end our reliance on these weapons completely. Therefore I am directing the Secretary of Defense to begin work immediately on research and development of alternative technologies that will not pose new dangers to civilians.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheantipersonnellandminesinitiative", "title": "Remarks on the Antipersonnel Landmines Initiative", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-antipersonnel-landmines-initiative", "publication_date": "16-05-1996", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

At this moment, unbelievably, some 100 million mines still lie just beneath the earth in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, and in Central America. To help end the anguish they cause, the Department of Defense will expand its efforts to develop better mine detection and mine-clearing technology for use in the many countries that are still plagued by mines. We will also strengthen our programs for training and assisting other nations as they strive to rid their territory of these devices. For these efforts, as well as those to develop alternatives to antipersonnel mines, we will assure sufficient funding. I will personally work with Congress on this issue. Many have worked to bring us to this moment. I especially want to say a word of thanks to Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Although I know he has differences with our approach, his dedication and his moral leadership on this issue have played a vital role in alerting the conscience of our Nation to the suffering that landmines cause. I also want to thank the many nongovernmental organizations that have worked so hard to put this issue at the top of the international agenda. As we turn to the task of achieving a worldwide ban, we must work together, and we will be successful. Let me say, again, I greatly appreciate the time and the energy that General Shalikashvili and the Joint Chiefs have devoted to this important issue over the last few months. It may take years before all the peoples of the world feel safe as they tread upon the Earth, but we are speeding the arrival of that day with the decisions announced today. I will do everything I can to implement them all, including the international agreement to ban all antipersonnel mines, as quickly as possible.

I want to thank all the officers who are here from the Customs, the Border Patrol, Immigration, from Chula Vista, from San Diego. I especially want to thank these uniformed officers who give their lives to make our lives safer and all the community citizens groups who work with them. Ladies and gentlemen, when I came to California and to San Diego 4 years ago and I listened and attempted to learn what was going on here, I saw an enormous amount of potential and a lot of stress. Mostly what people talked to me about then were two problems, the economy and the problem of crime and illegal immigration. I spent a lot of time here 4 years ago and had the opportunity to come back often since. If you will forgive me just one personal note, this is the first time I have come back to San Diego since the death of my friend Larry Lawrence, who served this country so well as our Ambassador to Switzerland, and I miss him now, coming back here, and I want to thank him for what he did for me here. Anyway, what we tried to do was to develop a serious approach, to work with you, to help you seize control of your destiny, and to help you do more of what you were already inclined to do. On the economy, I'd like to make just a couple of comments. Because we are building two new ships for our national defense, the San Diego shipyards are busy, securing another 4,000 jobs until the year 2000. Because in 1993 and 1994 the Congress agreed to invest in defense conversion, in high technology research and development and new environmental technologies and biotechnology, jobs are being created here that have a real future to grow in number and to strengthen and diversify the economy of this area. Because we have started work on a new sewage treatment plant and we are proposing to step up our sand reclamation efforts, thanks in no small measure to the relentless efforts of Congressman Filner, we are ensuring that the San Diego beaches will be enjoyed by children and their children for generations to come.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthecommunitysandiegocalifornia", "title": "Remarks to the Community in San Diego, California", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-community-san-diego-california", "publication_date": "10-06-1996", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 6184, "text": "But we all know that America has had, building over years and years and years, a serious problem of illegal immigration which has aggravated the crime problem along our borders. The Attorney General talked about some of the progress we have made. She gave me a report today which reviews where we are and what we have done. So as we have worked hard to bring the crime rate down all over America, we have made special efforts in our border communities, because we know that we have special responsibilities there. They have to be enforced, and the consequences of their enforcement or their failure to be enforced have to be borne primarily by the National Government. I have done what I could to get more money into California in very difficult fiscal circumstances in Washington to help you deal with the costs of illegal immigration-more than ever before- and I will continue to work on that. I agreed with what the district attorney said when he said there is a difference in being a safer community and a safe community. I agreed with what the sheriff said when he said that we'd never fully solve this problem until both the United States and our friends in Mexico are working together in a long-term and consistent way. But think about how far we have come in the last 3 1/2 years. Three and a half years ago, many people believed that these problems were totally intractable, that drugs would always flow freely, that illegal immigration would always be rampant, that criminal immigrants deported for crimes they committed here in America would return the very next day to commit crimes again. For a lot of years people in public life at election time talked tough about immigration, but did not do much about it. We tried to change that. We tried to substitute deeds for words. It is a pretty good practice in a lot of areas of life, and I think it is worked pretty well here. We will work with you to give you the tools you need to patrol your streets, protect your children, secure our common border. And you have to do what you can to help the police to bring the crime rate down and make your community safe. San Diego has the 5th lowest crime rate in the country of the 75 biggest urban areas. I actually believe when the numbers come out this year, you will be even lower than that.

{"id": 6185, "text": "Let me say, again, while the job is far from over-and we have a lot of work to do-the report I got from the Justice Department makes clear that we have begun to turn border communities under siege into communities where law and order and safety and security are once again the order of the day. I want to say too, again, I am glad that we are working to put 100,000 police officers on the streets of America, that we are putting community policing in every community in the country that is willing to receive it. But what really makes it work are law enforcement officers committed to it and citizens groups working on it. Today I had a very impressive briefing from people involved in the San Diego citizens patrol in the Safe Streets Now program. So I ask you, do not stop now. We need more citizens working with more police officers until crime is the exception, not the rule. When you are surprised when you hear about a crime, then you will know you have got a safe community. And you need to continue to do it. The second thing we are doing is to put criminals behind bars. And after they serve their time, if they do not belong here in the first place, they are being deported. The crime bill gave us the weapons we need to do things that had not been done before to deal with the problems of criminal activities by illegal immigrants. As of January of last year, we have arrested more than 1,700 criminal aliens and prosecuted them on Federal felony charges because they returned to America after having been deported in the first place. We are changing the policy of this country on that problem. We are also making strides in getting control of our border. We have added Border Patrol agents, in San Diego alone increasing by 762 the number of agents who are working for you by the end of this year. In El Paso, our border guards stand so close together, they can actually all see each other. Here in San Diego, control has been taken back of Imperial Beach from the criminals and the illegals. We deployed underground sensors, infrared night scopes, encrypted radios. We built miles of new fences, installed thousands of watts of new lighting. I heard what was said earlier about the threats facing San Diego residents in East County, particularly with the onset of the fire season. Today I have asked the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, to send 20 more law enforcement officers to Cleveland National Forest, and they will be there by the close of business today.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthecommunitysandiegocalifornia", "title": "Remarks to the Community in San Diego, California", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-community-san-diego-california", "publication_date": "10-06-1996", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

What they have done here today, over the last several months-I mean, it ought to be something that we all take for granted. It ought to be the rule in every jurisdiction in America. And I tell you, that is what we are trying to create for all the citizens of the United States, wherever they live. And I am very proud of what they have done. They have put aside politics and put the people of this community first, their safety first, their future first. That is why there has been an 84 percent increase in felony drug prosecutions in one year. That is why murders and robberies and car thefts have dropped so much, because they are all working together and working for you, instead of protecting their turf and playing politics. And I say, God bless them, we need more like them all over this country. Let me just say one other thing that affects Americans a long way from you, but I bet you have all identified with them in the past few months. Even as we crack down on illegal immigration and do more than has ever been done before on that, we must never forget that we are all a nation of immigrants and, except for the Native Americans, we all came from somewhere else. Our incredible diversity is a source of our rich potential as we move into this global society. Anybody who is willing to work hard, obey the law, respect their neighbors, and follow the values inherent in the Constitution ought to have a chance in America, and that ought to be the rule here. And because we are people and because we are imperfect, the country will always have problems. But we really fall into a dangerous trap when we start blaming our problems on other people just because they are different from us. I say that because even though I am a long way from there, my heart has been in my native South for the last several weeks as we have dealt with this incredible rash of church burnings. That is just another way of people finding a way-trying to blame somebody else or put down somebody else or put distance between them and someone else in a totally dehumanizing way, forgetting that everybody should be treated equally before the law, in the eyes of our fellow Americans, just as we are before God Almighty.

So they came in this morning, and we had a visit. I want to thank them for being here and for their commitment and for all those who are not here but who are at the conference. This conference is about closing the digital divide. And we have worked hard on that for the last several years in very specific contexts. Under the Vice President's leadership, we have worked to make sure that eventually a digital divide will not deprive business of the technology-savvy workers they need and will not hurt our educational systems today. We started with the first NetDay in California, back in 1994, when only 3 percent of our classrooms were wired and only 14 percent of our schools were. Now we know that, through the public-private partnerships that have been established all over America, through the Telecommunications Act and the E-rate, which the FCC set to make sure our poorest schools could afford to be connected, we are now up over 50 percent of the schools, from 3 percent, and over 80 percent of the classrooms, from 14 percent, since 1994. I am very pleased by that, and we are on our way to meeting our goal sometime next year of having all of our schools wired and, soon after that, all of our classrooms wired. I want to thank the Vice President and all the people in various industries who have supported us and helped us in this regard. But as Secretary Daley's most recent Falling Through the Net report shows, there is still a lot more to do. We must connect all of our citizens to the Internet not just in schools and libraries but in homes, small businesses, and community centers. And we must help all Americans gain the skills they need to make the most of the connection. So this morning, as they go back to their meeting, I want to announce a series of new plans and partnerships that will expand on both these efforts to use the combined forces of public, private, and nonprofit sectors, finally to slam shut the digital divide.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthedigitaldivideandexchangewithreporters", "title": "Remarks on the Digital Divide and an Exchange With Reporters", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-digital-divide-and-exchange-with-reporters", "publication_date": "09-12-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

As we have done on our previous tours, we will visit communities that have not fully participated in our Nation's economic growth. And yet, in the communities we will also see how partnerships between the public and private sectors can unleash the power of the Internet to link children and adults to a lifetime of learning, to provide access to distant medical care, to empower parents, to assist job seekers, to enhance safety, and foster economic development. Second, I am signing an executive memorandum to ensure that closing the digital divide will be a vital goal not just for Secretary Daley and for us here in the White House but throughout the Federal Government. For example, I am directing Secretary Daley to work with the private sector to develop a national strategy for connecting all Americans to the Internet and directing Secretaries Daley, Riley, Herman, Cuomo, and Shalala to expand our growing network of community technology centers. I just ask you all to think about this one thing. What do you believe the economic impact would be if Internet access and usage were as dense in America as telephone access and usage? I think it is clear that we need to keep working until we achieve this goal. Third, with the help of many other groups, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights is launching an initiative to empower the entire civil rights community through an expanding civilrights.org website, through leadership forums and even modern-day freedom riders who will bring high-tech training to the doorsteps of nonprofit organizations. As the Congress of National Black Churches has said, the digital divide is a key civil rights issue of the 21st century. That is why our civil rights organizations must be ready, wired, and able to lead the change. Fourth, the Benton Foundation is bringing together companies from across the computing, telecommunications, software, and Internet industries, as well as the Urban League and several other large private foundations, to create the Digital Divide Network, an enormous clearinghouse of information for information on public and private efforts to bring technology to underserved communities.

In a real sense, the choice facing men in every nation today, old or young, large and small, is a choice between moving into the modern world with all of its unlimited potential or turning back toward the restrictive world that is dominated by the dogma and the doctrine of the 19th century. So, in your lifetimes, and in the lifetimes of a majority of the nations on earth, the total of human knowledge has doubled twice. The growth of human knowledge has made obsolete many of the causes of friction and contention and division among nations. Certainly the advance of human knowledge has made war itself obsolete and impossible as a means of resolving differences between large or small nations. Above all, the growth of human knowledge has rendered obsolete and archaic the doctrine on which the dogma of communism was constructed. Man today has in his capacity the potential of ending human misery or ending human life. We can really, for the first time, see the promise and the prospect of eliminating hunger and poverty, illness, bias, and prejudice in our own land and, we would hope, all around the world.

And the Vice ENTITY and I owe those of you who have done so much to help us do that a profound debt of gratitude, and I thank you. Tonight I came mostly just to do that, just to say thank you, for all you do for the arts, for all you do for the Hispanic community, and for all you have done to help America move forward in the last 8 years. We now have the lowest Hispanic unemployment rate we have ever recorded, the lowest Hispanic poverty rate in a generation, a million new homeowners in the last 6 years. The earned-income tax credit has been doubled, and it is lifted over a million Hispanics out of poverty. The minimum wage helped 1.6 million Hispanic workers, and it is time to raise it again and help more. The Hispanic Education Action Plan to encourage Hispanic youth to stay in school and go to college, along with our scholarship initiatives and other things, have contributed to the fact that the college-going rate among Hispanic young people is up over 50 percent in the last 7 years. And-listen to this-a report which was issued last week said there has been a 500 percent increase in the number of Hispanic students taking advanced placement courses in high school to prepare for college. Under the Vice ENTITY's leadership, we have reduced the naturalization backlog at INS. And under Aida Alvarez's leadership, loans to Hispanic entrepreneurs by the SBA have increased by 250 percent. We have all been enriched by your work. And I know that because of your work, we will have more great singers, more great writers, more great actors and actresses. I know we have got a long way to go, too, because still Latino characters are only about 3 percent of those that appear on prime-time television. I just left Rita Moreno, and I told her that I enjoyed watching her as a nun on her television series. And we were laughing about it. And I think that you will see, if you keep working, though, more and more of our movies and our television shows and our Broadway shows reflecting the rich diversity of America. I have said on many occasions, and I will just say one more time tonight, that if I could have only one wish for America, believe it or not, it would not be for a continued unbroken economic prosperity.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalhispanicfoundationforthearts", "title": "Remarks to the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-hispanic-foundation-for-the-arts", "publication_date": "19-09-2000", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Williams High School over in Alexandria, Virginia, and its football team, which occurred-what-almost 40 years ago, not such a long time ago once you have reached my age, anyway. Now, a little over three decades later, that high school is in a school district which has students from over 180 different racial and ethnic groups, parents speaking over 100 different native languages. It is the most diverse school district in America. And I think it is sort of fitting that this movie, coming out in the new millennium, talks about something that to most of these kids is ancient history, that we hope they will never forget. Can we figure out a way to give them all a world-class education, with all their diversity? Can we figure out a way to make sure that every single child, every family, every faith in America is profoundly proud of its roots, understands them, and yet believes deep in the core of being that our common humanity is even more important than our unique characteristics? Not so long ago, a number of you in this room came to the White House for a showing of Mi Familia, the movie. Remember, you saw it; you were there. And so I was thinking about that tonight and feeling sort of nostalgic. And I think the central question that all of us have to ask ourselves, both within and beyond our borders now, is who is in our family anyway? There is an astonishing new book out, been out a few months, by a man named Robert Wright, called Non Zero, kind of a weird title unless you are familiar with game theory.

The other side is telling us everything that is wrong about the economy, and I will accept my share of the blame. But we are caught up in something worldwide. And any fair-minded observer knows that it is not just the United States that is had difficult economic times. A lot of countries in this, and we have the strongest economy of all of them. I call that winning the peace, for only then will we keep the promise of opportunity that is the birthright of every American.

I happen to think that that is a good qualification for being ENTITY of the United States, because I believe it is a prospering small business or large business environment that is going to do more to help people.

It is you who make the economy grow, ordinary men and women with the extraordinary dreams who have the grit to make those dreams real.

That understanding is really at the heart of what Larry Haygood again referred to as the Agenda for American Renewal. I talk about the global economy and then what we are going to do now to be the lead. We have the strongest economy; I want to help make it stronger. To do this, we have got to unleash the energy, the brainpower of our workers and our entrepreneurs, and again, particularly in small business because this is the area that employs the most and takes the risks and creates the new opportunities. I want to encourage investment so that wages rise and those unemployment lines shrink. That is why I am helping small business in particular and, hopefully, all business in general. We unveiled a good small business program the other day down in North Carolina. Reducing the corporate tax rate for small business 15 percent to 10 percent; increasing the amount of equipment that small business can expense, and thus that would create more jobs and new opportunities; simplifying the tax filing. Most small-business people know that the onerous reporting for tax purposes takes too many work hours, too many people hours, and we are trying to change that Then, of course, I still feel that to stimulate risk-taking, the reduction in the capital gains is very, very important, bringing people into the enterprise zones in the minority areas; a reduction in capital gains, a break on that will help attract jobs to the areas that need it the very most.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalsalutethepresidentandhisblackappointees", "title": "Remarks at the National Salute to the President and His Black Appointees", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-salute-the-president-and-his-black-appointees", "publication_date": "30-09-1992", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George Bush"], "gender": ["M"]}}

We are going to go forward with safety and health; obviously we have to do that. But we have got a moratorium, a blanket on new regulations, recognizing that there is too much control and regulation on the back of the small entrepreneur and the small-business person. We really do want to do what Lou was talking about, and that is to make health insurance available to everyone. We want to make health care more accessible and more affordable for everyone. That is why we are all -- have our shoulders to the wheel, fighting for health care reform without burdening small businesses with expensive new mandates and more payroll taxes. It keeps the quality of American health care where it belongs, number one in the entire world, and still says to those who cannot get insurance, we are going to make it available to you through pooling, and also we are going to reduce the costs. We are doing something about these crazy malpractice suits and also doing something about lifting the regulatory burden and streamlining the operating processes of our health care system. So we have got a good program there, and I hope that it'll get the kind of support in the very next Congress that we need to have it enacted into law. I want to reward the risktakers who bring capital and jobs to our inner cities; I touched on that. But it is very interesting to me that when we went to Los Angeles in the wake of the South Central problems, all the civic leaders there were saying we must have enterprise zones. We ought to try it at the Federal level. So we are fighting hard to bring the enterprise zones into reality. On issue after issue, you see the very sharp differences between my opponent and me, because he really does want a Government. He is already proposed more taxes, more spending, more regulations. He is already proposed programs that would result in the latter, in the last item, and tax plans and spending plans that would tax at the outset $150 billion more in taxes and $220 billion more in spending.

The words which the mayor has uttered have touched me very much and I have been most touched and stimulated by the words which Senor Postorelli has so kindly uttered in behalf of the Government of this great kingdom. It is very delightful to feel my association with that government and with this city. I know how much of the vitality of Italian effort comes out of this great center of industry and of thought. As I passed through your streets I had this sensation, a sensation which I have often had in my own dear country at home-a sensation of friendship and close sympathetic contact. I could have believed myself in an American city. And I felt more than that. I felt, as I have also felt at home, that the real blood of the country flowed there in the street, in the veins of those plain people who more than some of the rest of us have borne the stress and burden of the war. Because think of the price at which you and at which we have purchased the victory which we have won. Think of the price of blood and treasure not only, but the price of tears, the price of hunger on the part of little children, the hopes delayed, the dismay of the prospects, that bore heavy upon the homes of simple people everywhere. That is the price of liberty. Those of us who plan battles, those of us who conceive policies, do not bear the burden of it. We plan and others suffer, and the conquest of spirit is greater than the conquest of arms. These are the people that never let go and say nothing. They merely live from day to day, determined that the glory of Italy or the glory of the United States shall not depart from her. I have been thinking as I have passed through your streets and sat here that this was the place of the labors of the great Cavour, and I have thought how impossible many of the things that have happened in Italy since, how impossible the great achievements of Italy in the last three years, would have been without the work of Cavour.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthephilharmonicclubturinitaly", "title": "Remarks at The Philharmonic Club in Turin, Italy", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-philharmonic-club-turin-italy", "publication_date": "06-01-1919", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Woodrow Wilson"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And I have another thought. Perhaps you gentlemen think of the members of your Government and the members of the other governments who are going to confer now at Paris as the real makers of war and of peace. You are the makers of war and of peace. The pulse of the modern world beats on the farm and in the mine and in the factory. The plans of the modern world are made in the counting house. The men who do the business of the world now shape the destinies of the world, and peace or war is in large measure in the hands of those who conduct the commerce of the world. That is one reason why unless we establish friendships, unless we establish sympathies, we clog all the processes of modern life. As I have several times said, you can not trade with a man who does not trust you, and you will not trade with a man whom you do not trust. Trust is the very life and breadth of business; and suspicion, unjust national rivalry stands in the way of trade, stands in the way of industry. A country is owned and dominated by the capital that is invested in it. I do not need to instruct you gentlemen in that fundamental idea. In proportion as foreign capital comes in among you and takes its hold, in that proportion does foreign influence come in and take its hold. And therefore the processes of capital are in a certain sense the processes of conquest. I have only this to suggest, therefore. We go to Paris to conclude a peace. You stay here to continue it. We start the peace. It is your duty to continue it. We can only make the large conclusions. You constantly transact the details which constitute the processes of the life of nations. And so it is very delightful to me to stand in this company and feel that we are not foreigners to each other. We think the same thoughts. We entertain the same purposes.

And the heartbeat of American manufacturing, our auto industry, was flatlining. And all this meant that hundreds of thousands of Americans were losing their jobs each month. And nobody had any idea where the bottom would be. Four and a half years later, our businesses have created nearly 7 million new jobs over the past 36 months. We are producing more of our own energy; we are consuming less that we import from other countries. The cost of health care is slowing.

He is won the respect and admiration from his peers across the political spectrum. His Ph.D. thesis adviser, Greg Mankiw, chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush. Nobel Prize Winner Joe Stiglitz, on the other side of the economic spectrum, hired Jason to work for the CEA under President Clinton. After leaving President Clinton's White House, Jason finished his Ph.D. in economics, quickly acquired a reputation as a world-class scholar and researcher.

And so Eve, Jason's wife, who is an accomplished writer herself, has put up with a lot of hours with Jason away. Henry and Louisa, who are here, they have made a lot of sacrifices so that their husband and dad could be here working for the American people. So I appreciate you guys for sharing daddy just a little bit longer. And the reason it is important is because, while we have cleared away the rubble of crisis and laid a new foundation for growth, our work is nowhere near done. Inequality is still growing in our society. Too many young people are not sure whether they will be able to match the living standards of their parents. We have too many kids in poverty in this country still. There are some basic steps that we can take to strengthen the position of working people in this country, to help our economy grow faster, to make sure that it is more competitive. And some of that requires political will. Some of it requires an abiding passion for making sure everybody in this country has a fair shot. But it also requires good economists. Alan and Jason appreciate that. So sometimes, the rest of my staff thinks, oh, Obama is getting together with his economists, and they are going to have a wonkfest for the next hour. It is not just numbers on a page. It makes a difference in terms of whether or not people get a chance at life and also, how do we optimize opportunity and make sure that itwe do not have a contradiction between an efficient, growing, free market economy, and one in which everybody gets a fair shot and where we are caring for the vulnerable and the disabled and folks in our society who need help. So a growing economy that creates good middle class jobs, that rewards hard work and responsibility, that is our north star. Jason shares that focus. I know Alan shares that passion.

Less than 1 year ago, on April 7, 1965, I asked for the creation of the Asian development plan to seek economic advance and social justice for all of Asia. I pledged the full support of the United States of America to that task. Today we have begun to redeem that pledge. The act I sign this morning authorizes the United States of America to ratify the charter of the Asian Development Bank. Seldom have nations joined together in a collective venture that is so endowed with promise. First, for the Asian leaders, who conceived and organized the bank and who are so ably represented here today by the Ambassadors from their countries. For the people of those non-Asian nations which have signed the charter, and whose Ambassadors have come this morning to bespeak again their vision and their generosity. For my great friend, a true American, Eugene Black, whose energy and tact have been as indispensable as his experience and wisdom. And to the Congress of the United States and the members of both parties who have acted to invest in this enterprise not only the resources but the faith of the 190 million people whom they represent. This act is an economic Magna Carta for the diverse lands of Asia. Its charter links 31 countries in a union against the involuntary economic servitude imposed on the people of Asia by time and circumstance and by neighbor and nature. This billion dollar bank is a symbol that the twain have met, not as Kipling predicted, at God's great Judgment Seat, but at the place of man's shared needs. It is no longer possible to be a mere observer at that place. It is not possibleand it is not rightto neglect a people's hopes because the ocean is 'vast, or their culture is alien, or their language may be strange, or their race different, or their skin another color. Asia just must no longer sit at the second table of the 20th century's concern. The economic network of this shrinking globe is too intertwined. The political order of continents is too involved with one another. The threat of common disaster is too real for all human beings to say of Asia, or any other continent, Yours . . . is another sphere.

It is simply that there is no rest from the trials of freedom, there is no recalling what the pace of change has done to the map of this big world, there is no reducing our responsibilities while the challenges of progress will not permit us to name the site for our duel or the weapons that we use. It is that we cannot turn from the place of shared needs and expect either peace or progress to follow us. So today we have come here to the historic East Room of the White House and gathered at this place to start a journey together. We are taking another today by announcing that we have pledged a half of the $24 million that is needed to construct the large Mekong River project, the Nam Ngum tributary project in Laos. Seven other countries, Japan, the Netherlands, Canada, Thailand, Denmark, Australia, and New Zealand, are joining us in that effort. For the United States it is our first major commitment under our promise to expand economic and social development in Southeast Asia. The Nam Ngum project is the Mekong Committee's highest priority undertaking and, like the Asian Development Bank, it represents a major accomplishment in joint cooperation in the world. The first phase of the project will include a dam and power station with an installed capacity up to 30,000 kilowatts. Additional generators up to 120,000 kilowatts can be installed as they are needed. An international transmission line, with a link across the Mekong River, will connect the power station with the capital of Laos and northeast Thailand. This is just one example of how the fruits of technologyand the ingenuity of cooperation-can bring new life to whole new regions of the world. More, yes, much more, awaits our response. New crops and new breeds of livestock can be developed. It has been said that no statue was ever erected to the memory of a man or woman who thought it was best to let well enough alone.

Because this event gives me a chance, along with all of my fellow countrymen, to reflect on the beginnings of this Nation-and on the men who began it. It reminds us that every citizen in this land is the descendant of men who were once foreigners--who were once strangers from afar. This is what our great President Franklin Roosevelt was thinking about one day in April when he addressed the Daughters of the American Revolution by saluting them as My fellow immigrants. the first in that long procession of strangers who, over the centuries, have come to enrich our lives, our statesmanship, and our culture here in America. Today we think of Columbus Day as a time for honoring not only that great explorer, but also all of those Italians whose gifts have been freely given to make this Nation great. Enrico Fermi, Frank Capra, A. P. Giannini, Fiorello La Guardia, Max Ascoli, Joe DiMaggio, Johnny Pastore. I would like to call the name of each of you, because you mean that much to me and you have made great contributions. Steve Martini, who cuts my hair here at the White House and has cut the hair of Presidents for several years, is one of my most influential counselors, believe it or not. He is also one of my most recognized comforters in moments of distress and depression. I just cannot resist adding Jack Valenti and Joe Califano, because in the period that I have been here, no two men have given their country greater or more rewarding service. In the past year, I am very proud that by all of us working together we have made it much easier for people of such ability to come here to the United States. You may remember it was on October 3, last year, standing beside the Statue of Liberty, that I signed a new immigration bill that we had been trying to pass for years and we had finally, successfully gotten it through both Houses. That measure ended, I think, once and for all, the discrimination-the discrimination which, for nearly 40 years, handicapped those who wanted to call our land their home.

Under that old system, countries like Italy had very small immigration quotas. They had long lists of persons who were waiting to emigrate to the United States. At the same time preferred nations were failing to even fill the very large quotas that were assigned to them. But the Immigration Act of 1965 has not opened the floodgates to immigration as its opponents claimed that it would. In fiscal year 1966 the State Department granted 309,000 visas--only 9,000 more than the year before. The increase is almost invisible when you consider that the internal growth of the United States was over 3 million, while we had an increase of 9,000 coming in. The Immigration Act of 1965 does assign quotas on a basis of equality. What skills can you perform? Italy was granted 9,987 immigration visas in fiscal year 1965. In 1966, under the new law, Italy received 24,967. Portugal was granted 1,798 visas in 1965; 9,017 in 1966. The list goes on through all the countries with citizens desiring to relocate here in America. So in its short life, this Immigration Act of 1965 has brought happiness to many homes, has reunited many families that have been kept apart very cruelly for a good many years. It has brought us capable people that wish to put their skills at the service of the United States. It has earned us the friendship of nations which had resented this unfair treatment under the unjust quota system. It has demonstrated the desire of the people in the United States to end discrimination and to end it in every corner of our national life. For years, America has been a beacon of change and progress to men who wanted to escape old lands, old ways, and old injustices. That is what brought our fathers here; it still brings people here. But to men across the world, we have been the land whose revolution did not end; we have been the land whose eyes are always forward. So today, all around the world, we hear the cry for change.

You shared with us the life-shaping stories of your family and career that formed your deep sense of fairness and your unwavering drive to help others to do better.

At that time he said, and I want to quote his words, we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age. That very simple statement still expresses the purposes of this wonderful program, though the social security system has grown vastly larger since 1935. Today, as we meet here, more than an million Americans find social security benefit checks in their mailboxes each month. This represents more than $1 1/3 billion a month, more than $16 billion a year, providing a much more secure life for our citizens and contributing a great deal of economic soundness to our economic system. Millions of other Americans at their jobs each day are building up future benefits and looking forward to the day when they will qualify. Franklin Roosevelt called the original Social Security Act, and I quote, a cornerstone in a structure which is being built but is by no means complete. That is true today as it was 30 years ago when President Roosevelt stated it. We are working steadily with the enlightened Members of the Senate and the Congress and the Cabinet here with me this morning to build and to strengthen the social security system. Legislation has already passed the House of Representatives--it is now pending in the Senate--which will provide increased monthly benefits to retired persons, to widows, to orphans, and to the disabled. This year, for the first time, health insurance protection for persons of 65 and over will become a part of America's social security system. I believe that most Americans are looking forward with me to the day when these great measures are signed into law. In this country we all believe that every man wants dignity and a decent life, and not a dole. We believe that every man wants a fair chance, and not charity. We believe that older Americans have earned and deserve peace of mind, not pain and panic, when misfortune strikes. The social security system, and the historic legislation that is now pending in the Senate, are our testaments to those beliefs.

I told the Chinese leaders, as I told the students at Shanghai University yesterday, that we must continue to acknowledge our differences, for a friendship based on fiction will not long withstand the rigors of the world. But we agreed that there is much to be gained from mutual respect. I was heartened by some of the things that we saw. The Chinese have begun opening up their economy, allowing more farmers and workers to keep and sell on their own some of the fruits of their labor. The first injection of free market spirit has already enlivened the Chinese economy. I believe it has also made a contribution to human happiness in China and opened the way to a more just society. Yesterday, before we left, we sat in a Chinese home at one of the now-called townshipsthey were once called communes-the farm communes where they raise the foodstuffs for all of China, but now there is a difference.

The second point I want to make, that I made today and I leave with all of you is, this is the only time in my lifetime we have had a booming economy, improvements in all of our social fabric, the absence of crisis at home and domestic threats, and the absence of threats to our security around the world as big as those we faced in the cold war. None of this has ever happened before. The big question before us is, what are we going to do with this magic moment? Are we going to take the long look into the future and do the big things that America needs, or are we going to indulge ourselves in shortsighted frittering away of our present wealth and serenity at home and stability around the world?", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkswallstreetprojectconferencereceptionnewyorkcity", "title": "Remarks at a Wall Street Project Conference Reception in New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-wall-street-project-conference-reception-new-york-city", "publication_date": "13-01-2000", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 6217, "text": "For several reasons, I shall want to take some of the time available to us today, actually to read to you a statement. Now, Mr. Hagerty tells me that a mimeograph of it is being made and is going to be over here before the conference is ended. If that is true, I suggest there is no need for your making notes during the time I am dealing with this paper. The paper deals with an approach to the security problem, and there are three reasons that I should like to take it up today. First, I have sent down today to the Congress a reorganizational plan for the Defense Department. It is not radical in most ways, certainly, but it does attempt to point up that organization so as to secure a greater effectiveness, economy, speed in action, and more rapid production of materiel that has been appropriated for. the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, and the Director of Mutual Security. They have all returned, or at least all have returned except Secretary Wilson; and we have been having conferences on this same global problem. And finally, I met this morning with some of the legislative leaders, and we had this problem up for a long and exhaustive discussion. So I want to give you really the approach that we are now making toward this problem. I would like to present to you in a general way, and with fairly broad strokes, what I consider the sensible framework within which the United States and its allies can present in hard military fact an ever more effective posture of defense. A true posture of defense is composed of three factors--spiritual, military, and economic. Today I shall talk only about the last two. We Americans have frequently called for unity of basic purpose among our allies. I feel quite strongly that the least we can do is to display a similar continuity and unity in American purpose. This policy of ours, therefore, will not be tied to any magic, critical year which then has to be stretched out because of economic or production problems, but will be based on the sounder theory that a very real danger not only exists this year, but may continue to exist for years to come; that our strength, which is already very real, must now be made stronger, not by inefficient and expensive starts and stops, but by steady continuous improvements. I have always firmly believed that there is a great logic in the conduct of military affairs.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference450", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-450", "publication_date": "30-04-1953", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Dwight D.

{"id": 6218, "text": "If these two logical disciplines can be wedded, it is then possible to create a situation of maximum military strength within economic capacities. If, on the other hand, these two are allowed to proceed in disregard one for the other, you then create a situation either of doubtful military strength, or of such precarious economic strength that your military position is in constant jeopardy. It has been the purpose of this administration ever since it took office, finding itself confronted with a crazy quilt of promises, commitments, and contracts, to bring American military logic and American economic logic into joint strong harness. No more glaring illustration of the lack of balance between the military logic and the economic logic could possibly be found than the situation that existed when we took office. On the one hand, we found our allies deploring our unfulfilled defense promises. On the other hand, we found there was a total carryover of $81 billion in appropriated funds, largely committed, for which cash must be provided from revenues in future fiscal years, over and above the normal annual cost of government. It is just as if the late administration had gone to the store and ordered 81 billion dollars worth of goods, which we have got to pay for as they are delivered, in addition to paying the regular household running expenses. The fiscal situation represented by these two extremes absolutely has to be brought into some kind of realistic focus, and the only way to do it is to have a completely new, fresh look without any misleading labels. As you know, over the past years I have been involved in the European end of defense, and therefore I think I know all about paper divisions and cardboard wings. For the last 3 months, I have been heavily involved in the American end of defense, and day after day have had to struggle with the basic equation that links the military safety of this country and of the free world with the ability of the world to pay its bills and earn a living. This morning I told the legislative leaders that already we can see our way clear to ask the Congress to appropriate at least 8 billion less in new money for the fiscal year 1954 than had been asked for by the previous administration. This is a preliminary figure based on 3 months' hard work. The great bulk of it, of course, relates to security programs. More definite figures will become available as appropriation requests are presented to the Congress during the next few weeks. You will note that I have been talking about the new appropriations for fiscal 1954.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference450", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-450", "publication_date": "30-04-1953", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Dwight D.

{"id": 6219, "text": "Actual cash savings for 1954 will be determined only as Congress acts on the appropriation requests. These savings will not reduce the effective military strength we will deliver to ourselves and our allies during fiscal 1954. They are already on the books and in contracts. Deliveries actually will be speeded up through the reduction of lead time, and concentration on producing those items which make the most military sense for the immediate future. Practically everyone concerned with the problem can with some justification be a special pleader. But I am sure that what the overwhelming majority of Americans want to believe is that their Government is working with diligence and intelligence to bring about as rapidly as possible a condition of true military strength. I also believe that the overwhelming majority of the people of the free world appreciate the fact that a healthy American economy and a functioning economy in their own home country are inseparable from true defense. Furthermore, I have a deep conviction that all these people possess a fundamental common sense Which permits them to grasp the difference between a quiet, steady, long-term improvement in their defense position and the tempests stirred up by public arguments over the artificial arithmetic which is so easy to produce in the defense field. The program we are presenting is a long-term program, calling for a steady and adequate flow of men and materials to present a position of genuine strength to any would-be aggressor. The basic elements of our strategic problem have not materially changed in recent years, and certainly not in recent days. The areas and peoples vital to our Nation's welfare are the same as they have been for a long time. What we are doing is to adopt a new policy for the solution of the problem. This change in policy is radical and cannot be effected overnight. There exists what is, in effect, a straitjacket, comprising prior authorizations, appropriations, and contracts. The essence of the change is this. We reject the idea that we must build up to a maximum attainable strength for some specific date theoretically fixed for a specified time in the future. Defense is not a matter of maximum strength for a single date. It is a matter of adequate protection to be projected as far into the future as the actions and apparent purposes of others may compel us. It is a policy that can, if necessary, be lived with over a period of years. Finally, I would like to remind you of what I have said many times before, and will probably say many times again.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference450", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-450", "publication_date": "30-04-1953", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Dwight D.

{"id": 6220, "text": "Today I want to talk to you about our Nation's duty to ensure that all America's seniors can enjoy their golden years as healthy as modern medicine will allow. I want to talk about my plan to strengthen and modernize Medicare and the important steps we can take to encourage older Americans to undergo health screenings that can save their lives and improve the quality of their lives. For 34 years now, Medicare has been the cornerstone of our efforts to protect the health of the disabled and our seniors. Last month at the White House, I unveiled a fiscally responsible plan to secure and modernize this vital program for the 21st century. The plan will strengthen Medicare by controlling cost, promoting competition, and dedicating a significant portion of the budget surplus to keeping the Trust Fund solvent until the year 2027. And my plan will modernize Medicare by matching its benefits to the latest advances of modern medicine. Since Medicare's founding in 1965, a medical revolution has transformed health care in America. Once the cure for many illnesses was a scalpel; now, just as likely, it is a pharmaceutical. That is why I made helping seniors afford the prescription drugs essential to modern medical care a key part of the Medicare plan. But even as we modernize Medicare with the prescription drug benefit, we also must modernize Medicare's preventive care benefits. Today, doctors have new tools to detect and prevent diseases earlier and more effectively than ever. And for millions, early detection can mean the difference between a full recovery and a bleak prognosis. For instance, if prostate cancer is caught early, the survival rate is 99 percent; but if it is not , the rate can be a discouraging 31 percent. In 1997 we worked across party lines to expand Medicare coverage for preventive services. But too few seniors still are using this benefit. Last year just one in seven older women received a mammogram covered by Medicare. For many seniors on fixed incomes, who every day must struggle to pay for food, rent, and other necessities, the cost of even a modest copayment can be prohibitive, and that can cost lives. It makes no sense for Medicare to put up roadblocks to screenings and then turn around and pick up the hospital bills its screenings might have avoided. No one should have to undergo a dangerous surgical procedure that could have been prevented by a simple test. No senior should have to hesitate to get the preventive care they need.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress121", "title": "The President's Radio Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-radio-address-121", "publication_date": "10-07-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

This weekend is a good time to give thanks for our blessings and to resolve to do better in the coming year. One of our greatest blessings as Americans is that we live in a country with a growing economy, where people can pursue their dreams, turn ideas into enterprises, and provide for their families. It is a measure of our economy's resilience that even with high oil prices and softness in the housing market, we are still growing. In November, our economy added jobs for the 51st straight month, making this the longest period of uninterrupted job growth on record. And the fundamentals of our economy are strong. Yet it is more important to remember that behind all these numbers are real people. These people include the entrepreneurs who live their dreams by starting up new businesses. These people include small-business owners who create most of the new jobs in our economy. And most of all, these people include the tens of millions of working moms and dads whose jobs provide for their families. I know that even in this growing economy, some of you have real concerns. Some of you worry about your ability to afford health care coverage for your families. Some of you are concerned about meeting your monthly mortgage payments. Some of you worry about the impact of rising energy costs on fueling your cars and heating your homes. You expect your elected leaders in Washington to address these pressures on our economy and give you more options to help you deal with them. And I have put forth several proposals to do so. In the last month, Congress has responded to some of my initiatives. They passed a good energy bill, they passed a temporary patch to protect middle class families from the burden of the Alternative Minimum Tax, and they passed a law that will help protect families from higher taxes when their lenders reduce their mortgage debt. Congress needs to do more to decrease America's dependence on oil. Congress needs to pass legislation that will help make health care coverage more affordable for small businesses and workers who buy their own policies. And Congress needs to act quickly on the rest of my proposals to help families struggling with rising mortgage payments keep their homes. Most of all, we need to set a good example in Washington by being careful with your money. I am disappointed that leaders in Congress sent me a massive spending bill that includes about 9,800 earmarks.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress407", "title": "The President's Radio Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-radio-address-407", "publication_date": "29-12-2007", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 6222, "text": "On Wednesday night I will present my plan to generate jobs and increase the incomes of the American people. This morning I want to talk with you for a few moments about that program, its goals, and the thinking that went into it. As I have traveled our country over the last year and a half, a single theme has emerged repeatedly from all of you in every region and from every walk of life. bold, comprehensive change to reverse the trickle-down policies of the 1980's and restore the vitality of the American dream. Over the last 12 years, while the middle class saw their tax burdens rise and their incomes go down, the wealthiest Americans, whose incomes went up, often by paperwork manipulation and moving jobs overseas, saw their taxes go down. Higher deficits came with lower taxes on the wealthy. And those deficits forced Government to cut back on essential services to the middle class, the working poor, and the neediest Americans. Good families in embattled neighborhoods saw their children getting by with outdated school books, going to school in neighborhoods that were ever more dangerous, while the wealthiest Americans in protected communities watched their bankbooks grow. Our economy suffered through two grinding recessions, and our job-creating engine stalled. The status quo simply is not working for working families anymore. The experts say we are in a robust economic recovery. our best companies doing better, people being able to refinance their homes, and consumer confidence on the upswing since the election. The unemployment rate has been over 7 percent for 14 months now, and we are 3 million jobs behind where we ordinarily would be in a real economic recovery. And the risk of doing the same old thing is far higher than the cost of change. If we do not change, the American economy and the living standards of our broad middle class will continue to decline, and many of us and most of our children will not enjoy the standard of living that past Americans have. It requires us to forsake the old order and to embrace a new one. Change means asking everyone to pull his or her own weight for the common good.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress527", "title": "The President's Radio Address", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-radio-address-527", "publication_date": "13-02-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Just this week I cut the White House staff by 25 percent and saved $10 million compared to the budgets of my predecessors. I have ordered further administrative cuts in Federal departments and agencies of $9 billion over the next 4 years, with more to follow from tough and smart management. I am also ordering an investigation into the enormous cash bonuses paid to officials of the departing administration. In some cases it was done just minutes before I was sworn into office. While I deeply admire the dedicated members of our Federal services, we simply cannot have extravagant payments made to departing bureaucrats and political cronies at a time when most people are tightening their belts. If Government is going to ask the American people to contribute, it must lead by example and learn to do more while spending less. That is a challenge I have embraced and one I will present to the Congress on Wednesday. Next, we will take the battle to the special interests. We will demand that those who see the Tax Code as a table game to be won rather than a social compact to be respected pay their fair share of taxes. I will keep my pledge to restore fairness to the Tax Code. We will raise taxes on the wealthiest individuals and companies in our society. That will be one of their contributions to create the high-skill, high-wage economy that we seek. And I will say to the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the others who profit from the status quo, they must join our cause to make comprehensive reforms in our medical care system. The time has come for all Americans to have affordable health care, a real chance at a healthy life. In return for these contributions, we are determined to create long-term, good-paying private sector jobs. We will encourage the development of new technologies and find markets for them all across America and around the word.

I am even more passionate about it today. Because while our economy has been growing for 4 years and those at the top are doing better than ever, average wages have barely budged. We have got to reverse those trends. We have got to build an economy that works for everyone, not just a fortunate few. And the opportunity agenda I laid out last week will help us do that. It is an agenda with four parts. And number four, making sure that hard work pays off, with wages you can live on, savings you can retire on, and health insurance that is there when you need it. I want to work with Congress on this agenda wherever I can. But in this year of action, whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, I will. a pen to take executive action and a phone to rally citizens and business leaders who are eager to create new jobs and new opportunities. In Wisconsin, I ordered an across-the-board reform of our training programs to train folks with the skills employers need and then match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now. In Pittsburgh, I directed the Treasury to create MyRA, a new way for working Americans even if you are not wealthy to start your own retirement savings. In Maryland, I rallied the leaders of some of America's biggest tech companies to help us make sure all our kids have access to high-speed Internet and up-to-date technology to help them learn the skills they need for the new economy. And at the White House, I brought together business leaders who have committed to helping more unemployed Americans find work, no matter how long they have been looking. based on whether applicants can do the job, not when they last had a job. So when you hear me talking about using my pen and my phone to make a difference for middle class Americans and those working to get into the middle class, that is what I mean. And I am going to keep asking students and parents and business leaders to help, because there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments, ready to move this country forward, and determined to restore the founding vision of opportunity for all.

He asked, If we do not have homes to go to, what good is an education? It was a heartfelt question, one that could be asked by anyone who is lost a home or a job in this recession. Because if you are out of work or facing foreclosure, all that really matters is a new job. All that really matters is a roof over your head. All that really matters is getting back on your feet. That is why I am fighting each and every day to jump-start job creation in the private sector, to help our small-business owners grow and hire, to rebuild our economy so it lifts up a middle class that is been battered for so long. But even as we focus on doing all that, even as we focus on speeding up our economic recovery, we also know that when it comes to jobs, opportunity, and prosperity in the 21st century, nothing is more important than the quality of your education. At a time when most of the new jobs being created will require some kind of higher education, when countries that outeducate us today will outcompete us tomorrow, giving our kids the best education possible is an economic imperative. That is why, from the start of my administration, we have been fighting to offer every child in this country a world-class education, from the cradle to the classroom, from college through a career. Earlier this week, I announced a new Skills for America's Future initiative that will help community colleges and employers match what is taught in the classroom with what is needed in the private sector, so we can connect students looking for jobs with businesses looking to hire. We are eliminating tens of billions of dollars in wasteful subsidies for banks to administer student loans and using that money to make college more affordable for millions of students. And we have launched a Race to the Top in our States to make sure our students, all of them, are graduating from high school ready for college, so we can meet our goal of graduating a higher proportion of students from college than any other country in the world by 2020.

And if I speak of the personal relationship between the two of us, I would add that I am inclined to apply that also to the relationship between our two countries, our two nations. As I look back over the period since I have been in political office, that means since the end of the last war, I think it was at that time unique, unique and unparalleled in world history, that the victor who had gained unimaginable strength and power through his victory showed such great generosity by helping all the countries of the world, including the vanquished, to reconstruct their countries. In this way you helped to secure the peace in the world. I said to you this morning, Mr. President, when we had our conversation, I understood that your feelings were a bit bitter about the fact that so little gratitude was shown by the countries for what the United States has done after the last war. But such is human nature, one cannot expect gratefulness, and what one has received in the way of good deeds is very easily forgotten. the more happy and pleased, Mr. President, to be able to say that these things are not forgotten in Germany. The German people will always remember what they have received from the United States of America, and this I feel is the basis of the friendship that exists between our two countries. That is the basis, the foundation, of the trust and confidence which enables genuine cooperation. I think we have all the essential objectives in common; and even if there should be some misunderstanding, some differences from time to time, I think there can be no doubt whatsoever, neither here in the United States nor in the Federal Republic of Germany, that this friendship between our two countries is a firm one, that there is also this conviction that we have common tasks and common missions to fulfill. I am not so presumptuous to say that Germany could speak for Europe, but on the other hand I feel that the Federal Republic of Germany can be, must be the stabilizing factor, the stabilizing element, in Europe. By our attitude we can show how necessary, how desirable it is for Europe to come closer to the United States and also to try and tie the United States of America, or let me put it this way, the North American Continent more closely to Europe.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstoaststhepresidentandchancellorerhard", "title": "Toasts of the President and Chancellor Erhard", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/toasts-the-president-and-chancellor-erhard", "publication_date": "12-06-1964", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Lyndon B.

We feel this responsibility for the countries which are still in a somewhat backward and underdeveloped stage, or countries which still have to live in slavery. On the other hand, we are grateful to you, Mr. President, and to the United States of America for the understanding you have been showing for our particular German problem. I have said on several occasions on this visit-I said it also today when I had the honor to address the Senate of the United States--that it would not be a good and a right alliance, it would not be real friendship, if each country were to look at its own interests only, were to look at the geographical area in which itself is situated and would not look beyond that. And it would be a bad alliance, it would be a bad friendship, if every partner were not ready also to stand up for the other partners. We fully recognize the seriousness of your problems. I think of Cuba, I think in terms of South Viet-Nam, we consider them also to be our problems. We also feel an obligation, as you are understanding our particular situation in the Federal Republic of Germany, our particular problems, and I hope and I am sure that this is a good firm foundation of our friendship and cooperation. And where there is so much good will and deep and honest friendship I am absolutely convinced that this good relationship will continue between our two countries and that it will continue to be an element of freedom, of security, and of peace in the world. President, today during our conversations we have assured one another of our mutual sympathy, and when I have done that I think it was more than a diplomatic phrase or a diplomatic formula. It was, so to speak, let me say that quite frankly, a human confession and I think it was understood in that way by the two of us. We are convinced that it is our common task, and I say that with all humility which is due to us Germans and which we must observe, I think this is a common task with which we are confronted.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstoaststhepresidentandchancellorerhard", "title": "Toasts of the President and Chancellor Erhard", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/toasts-the-president-and-chancellor-erhard", "publication_date": "12-06-1964", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Lyndon B.

From our talks today, I am more confident than ever that our friends in Morocco are committed to that struggle. As I said this morning in receiving His Majesty, our ultimate task is to create among the nations of the world a community of peace. I often read and reread Article I of the United Nations Charter. I believe all of us-and especially those of you who are too young to know how the world felt in 1945--should come to know it line by line. collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace; --collective measures for the suppression of acts of aggression; --adjustment or settlement of international disputes by peaceful means; --the development of friendly relations among nations based upon respect for the principle of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples; --international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character; and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion. In those years Americans have taken more than 200,000 casualties in collective measures to suppress acts of aggression. All of us, working together, at different times and in different places, have made sure that aggression did not succeed. The chances for world security are larger, and the hope for world peace is nearer, because tonight aggression has not succeeded. Meanwhile, in lands and nations throughout the world much has been done to lift the standards of living. In Western Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia, cooperation in economic and social progress is no longer just a matter of words.

At the present time, the time characterized by an increase in problems which are so great and serious that they seem sometimes very difficult to solve, we deem it most beneficial that chiefs of state should get together from time to time. This we deem essential because we believe that as a result of their meetings and direct discussions, bonds of cooperation among nations grow stronger on the one hand, and, on the other, the chances for peace in the world become greater. It is this belief which has prompted us ever since our accession to the throne to visit on a number of continents the chiefs of state whose systems and customs differ from ours. We have seen that differences in systems and differences between races and cultures do not necessarily make it impossible to bring about a rapprochement of points of view, nor do they necessarily prevent the achievement of desired objectives. It is our pleasure to be visiting again today this friendly country and to meet His Excellency, the ENTITY, Mr. Johnson, knowing that our meeting each other will definitely open up before us wider and greater horizons for a free collaboration and cooperation in the interest of our two peoples. We aspire to benefit from the experience of the people of the United States, which has become an example and an ideal in progress in the economic, agricultural, and industrial development fields.

We are very happy to have him here. President, since I came into office over 18 months ago, you are the youngest head of state to be honored in this room, and you represent the youngest nation. But though you are a young man and you come from a young nation, there are things we can learn from you. Tomorrow I have a meeting scheduled with my Cabinet on the budget. I find in studying your administration that you not only have a balanced budget but a favorable balance of trade, and I'd like to know your secret before our meeting with the Cabinet. This morning when I welcomed you on the South Lawn, I told our Americans listening on television that the Congo was a good investment. I would like to tell this very special group in this room why I consider the Democratic Republic of the Congo a good investment. I could say it was a good investment because it is one of the richest countries in the world in terms of natural resources. But it has far more than that. It has, also, people who are able to develop that wealth if given the chance to do so. In my visit to your country in 1967, I was impressed, of course, by my meeting with you and other government leaders. But I was impressed, too, when I visited a shipyard and the university and a factory and walked over the streets of Kinshasa, and I saw the people, working hard, strong, vigorous, vital and very proud-proud of their country, and with great dignity. And when we combine rich natural resources with a strong, vigorous people, and a leader who is able to provide the stability and the vision for progress for that country, then that country is a good investment, a good investment for its own people or for others who may desire to participate in its growth.

An enormous amount of the credit for that development goes to its leaders and particularly to our honored guest tonight.

This morning in response to your kind words of welcome, and at the State Department in response to Secretary Rogers' toast, I said this very forcefully, that in coming here I was bringing the message of gratitude and friendship to the American people, and I said to Secretary Rogers that we have a saying in the Congo that it is in adversity that you know your friends. My country, beset with problems and difficulties from 1960 to 1965, my country had added a word to the international vocabulary. But fortunately, the American people, with all its succeeding ENTITYs since ENTITY Kennedy, ENTITY Johnson, and yourself, Mr. ENTITY, was never discouraged and continued to follow the same consistent line of confidence in my country and today we witness the crowning moment of this task of confidence.

We are the living demonstration in concrete terms--the relations between the United States and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are a demonstration of what has happened because you have helped us, and we are showing proof that this aid was not wasted, that we have used diligently the aid given to us for our recovery, for our march towards progress. I am sure, Mr. ENTITY, that your voice will be heard by the Americans to whom you have said that the Congo is a good investment. This means for American investors, particularly of the private sector, that our recovery has been effective; that we have political stability, order, peace, and calm in the Congo; that the Congolese people is cured from its growing pains; that a people without a leader has become a people with discipline, work, and creative energy. You have helped us launch the Zaire operation 1 which has succeeded. Our country, which was the sick child of Africa, now sets an example for all the countries of the developing world of what can happen with will, with determination, and this is a marvelous example we can show to the whole world. ENTITY, you were speaking of what the American investors value most. What they want in a young country is the stability, and that we have; resources, and that we have also. But even more than our investment code which guarantees these investments, there is the fact that neither in our philosophical doctrine nor in our economic concept is there room for the concept of nationalization. We respect private ownership and we see great profits to be derived from this policy. Confusion in the early stages of our history was taken advantage of to make people believe, and to make particularly American investors believe, that we would nationalize, but this is not true.

As Wendell Ford and Carl Perkins and Nick Joe Rahall and all of us who've served in Washington together know, most of the new ideas that come forward for us to address have already been understood and proposed by Jennings Randolph, because he has his heart close to the people of this Nation. And when there is a real need for better housing, better transportation, better use of coal, better life for the working families of this Nation, Jennings Randolph seems to have a special sensitivity to understand that need and to lead the rest of us in meeting those needs for all.

The problem that I have had in preparing myself for the debate is, which Ronald Reagan am I going to face tomorrow evening on television? Because as the election has progressed and as we get closer and closer to the voting time, he has flip-flopped on almost every conceivable issue depending upon what audience happens to be listening to him at the particular time. He is been strongly against, even prayed against, aid for New York City, but lately he is been in New York, telling them how much he loves New York. He was against many things for which he now professes to support.

I do not know if I will be debating a man of this election campaign who now professes to be for improving the social security system, or one who on at least four different occasions has suggested making social security voluntary, a proposal that would mean the end of a strong and viable social security system.

I do not know if I am debating against a man who now professes to be for working families who are temporarily unemployed, or one who said not too long ago that unemployment compensation was just a prepaid vacation for freeloaders. I do not know if I am debating a man who lately professes to be almost in the image of Franklin Roosevelt, or one who a little earlier said that the foundation for the New Deal was fascism.

I am proud to have been able in my administration, working with your Democratic Governors, United States Senators, the Members of Congress, to do more for the coal industry than ever before in the history of this country. We will produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America. We will exceed 800 million tons for the first time, and the trend is in the right direction. This is the first year in our history in which more than 50 percent of all our Nation's electricity has been produced from coal. Our exports of coal to foreign countries will set an alltime record this year. And we could load millions more tons of coal on ships to be sold overseas if we just had the transportation system and the port loading facilities available for this new demand for coal that is been brought about by the policies of our administration. In the near future, as you know, you will have an exciting, new, bright life ahead of you as we begin to produce synthetic liquids and gaseous fuels from your coal. We can triple-triple-United States coal production in the next 15 years if we keep Democrats in office to help you. That is where we need your help. As you know, over the past several weeks, since the Congress has finally passed our new energy policy into law, we have begun to move on our new synthetic fuels program.

If we are ever to achieve our goal for energy security, do not let anyone try to convince .you that the best way to produce and' use more American coal is to lower air quality standards or water quality standards. What these men on the platform and I have done, working with Sam Church, ENTITY of the United Mine Workers, is to try to make sure that all the projected increases that I have described to you, all of them, include maintaining the quality of our environment. We do not have to make people choose between jobs and prosperity on one hand and good health and a beautiful America on the other. We can burn coal, let it be the bright new vision of an independent policy in the future, and still keep our air clean and our water clean and our land productive. Do not let anyone mislead you about that, because the best way to turn people against coal is for them to think that we have to lower those standards for air and water quality. Last week the Environmental Protection Agency extended a plan in Ohio which will allow greater use of coal. This plan sets limits on average emissions over a 30-day period, rather than a daily average. And this will continue on into 1982. This would allow much greater use of Ohio coal. Also last week the EPA and Armco Steel Company reached agreement on an innovative approach to control air pollution of the Armco plant in Middletown, Ohio. Instead of controlling each individual source, it limits the total pollution emitted from an imaginary bubble over the entire plant. This allows the company to concentrate its cleanup efforts on sources that are the least costly to control. The result is more pollution control per dollar spent. This is the first practical application of this new principle. And now other steel companies throughout the Nation can do the same, reducing pollution control costs and thus raising capital or money to modernize their facilities and to put more people to work. Just last Friday we announced a grant to finance a coke production plant in Canova, West Virginia. This would not only mean new jobs at the plant when it is finished, but 300 construction jobs and 1,500 miners will go to work now in West Virginia, in Virginia, and in Kentucky.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentswaynecountywestvirginiaremarksrallywitharearesidents", "title": "Wayne County, West Virginia Remarks at a Rally With Area Residents.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/wayne-county-west-virginia-remarks-rally-with-area-residents", "publication_date": "27-10-1980", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Jimmy Carter"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I tell the people, in front of these enthusiastic and large crowds we have been having, that, you know, probably the wisest reason to put me back in there is so that she will be the First Lady for 4 more years. I am running with a good man. I admit it, that Dick Cheney is not the prettiest face on the ticket. But that is not why I picked him. I picked him because of his sound judgment, his experience, his ability to do the job. I want to thank Dr. Bob Templin for allowing us to use this important facility. I will tell you why. Part of the reasons I am seeking the Presidency again is because I understand that if we use our community college system wisely, people will be trained for the jobs which will exist. See, in order to keep jobs here in America, we have got to have a workforce that is capable of filling the jobs of the 21st century. And one of the crucial links in making sure people have the skills necessary to fill the jobs that are coming is the community college system. And Bob understands that. I want to thank my friend Senator George Allen for being here. I want to thank Frank Wolf and Ed Schrock. I appreciate Frank's concern and dedication for those who need American help. He understands what I know, that we have a responsibility in the world to help those who hunger and those who are afflicted by disease and those who suffer under tyranny. And I appreciate Frank's deep concern not only about the citizens of this State and our country but also the deep concern about those to whom we can deliver help.

I am going to get to that in a minute. Before I do, I want to talk about a couple of other points. One is that we are making progress in spreading the peace. We also know that freedom is not our country's gift to the world; freedom is the Almighty God's gift to each person in this world. And that is why that is why over the next 4 years, we will continue to work to spread freedom, for our own security and for the sake of others. We have done some hard work over the past 3 years. We must never forget the lessons of September the 11th. First of all, the enemy that we face is cruel. Unlike Americans, they do not have a conscience. They are willing to kill innocent people in order to shake our will and our resolve. As we work to secure our country, we must never forget the nature of the people. You cannot reason with them. You cannot sit down and say, Look, why will not you change your ways? And your President must clearly understand that. That is why it is important for us that is why over the next 4 years, we will engage them in places like Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere so we do not have to face them here at home. Secondly, when this country speaks, it better mean what it says, in order to make the world a more peaceful place. In other words, when we say things, we must mean what we say. And when I said that if you harbor a terrorist, you are just as guilty as the terrorist, I meant exactly that. And that is why we made the decision a tough decision, by the way; nobody wants to commit kids to war. That is what you got to understand. It is the hardest decision a President can make, and you only do so if you are convinced it is going to lead to peace.

{"id": 6241, "text": "And so thanks to our United States military and our friends and allies, Afghanistan is now free. Afghanistan is an ally on the war on terror. I will tell you something really interesting two things I want to share with you about Afghanistan. I can remember earlier in the spring, I think it was, people were talking about how maybe people are not going to vote. Do not you remember, there was some serious terrorist attacks on women, in particular, that had got their registration cards and were in the process. Turns out, over 8 million I think the number is 8 million Afghan citizens have registered to vote, far exceeding expectations. They want to live in a free society. They want to be able to exercise their rights as a human being. Secondly, when I was in Cleveland a while back this is like the last couple of weeks I have been traveling a lot, so it is kind of hard for me to remember exactly where I have been I went to the International Children's Game. I helped kick it off. And I was there speaking to the athletes, and right to my right I will never forget it was the Afghan girls soccer team. Now, let me tell you what is interesting about that. They would not have been in the United States they would not even have been playing soccer under the Taliban. These people were so brutal, so dark in their vision that many young girls did not have a chance to be educated. Not only do we have an ally in the war on terror, there is a more compassionate and decent society growing in Afghanistan, which is in our interests, and it is in the world's interests. As the American people look at this election, they must take a look at the candidates and determine who best understands the lessons to be learned from September the 11th. Another lesson is, is that we must deal with threats before they fully materialize. In this world of threats to our homeland, in this world where there are folks who cannot stand our country and our way of life, we must deal with threats. They must be dealt with hopefully, diplomatically; hopefully, we can cure things, problems peacefully. That ought to be the first priority of any President. However, if diplomacy fails, we must be a country that is willing to take action to defend ourselves. He had used weapons of mass destruction against his own people. He had terrorist organizations in his country. He was a sworn enemy of the United States of America. He is a person that invaded countries in his neighborhood.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdiscussionnorthernvirginiacommunitycollegeannandalevirginia", "title": "Remarks in a Discussion at Northern Virginia Community College in Annandale, Virginia", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-discussion-northern-virginia-community-college-annandale-virginia", "publication_date": "09-08-2004", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

The United Nations Security Council the U.N. Security Council concluded Saddam was a threat and passed a resolution unanimously which said, Disarm, disclose, or face serious consequences. That is what the free world said. And he deceived the world again. I say again because that is what he'd been doing for a decade. And then he deceived the inspectors. Remember, with that period of time, we said, Oh, let the inspections work. We were all for that. But it was clear that he was deceiving them. So I had a choice to make, and that is, whether or not to trust a man who had used weapons of mass destruction, somebody who had used somebody who had defied the free world. My choice was, do I forget the lessons of September the 11th, or do I take actions necessary to defend our country? And given that very difficult choice, I chose to defend America. We did not find the stockpiles that we thought we would find. We have not found them yet. But he did have the capability of making weapons. Knowing what I know today, I would have made the same decision. We could not afford to take the chance that a sworn enemy of America would share capabilities with an enemy which hates us. I will tell you an interesting story and by the way, I think the candidates for President must say yes or no, whether or not they would have made the same decision. I tell the story about the seven men that came to see me in the Oval Office. They had had their right hands cut off by Sad-dam Hussein because his currency had devalued and he was looking for a scapegoat. And they had a X burned in their forehead as well, to brand them as enemies of the state, I guess; I do not know what the symbol was. But they came to see me in the Oval Office. The fellows walked in and were just overwhelmed by the majesty of a shrine to democracy, and it was imagine, seeing ENTITY .

A free Iraq is going to change the world. For those of you with young kids, I want you to think about a world that is going to be much more peaceful, a country more secure because, during these difficult days, we are standing true to our firm belief and our ideals that freedom equals peace. It is hard work because there are people in that in the Middle East that cannot stand the thought of a free society. It just scares them. And they do not scare us. They are tough, but we are resolute because we understand the charge of history, the charge that history has given us. We have a duty. We have a duty to keep our word. We have told the Iraqi people and the people of Afghanistan that we are with you. They are watching carefully to determine whether or not they can take a risk for freedom, or whether or not America's word does not mean anything. These are times when people will look back and say, thank goodness the American people stood true to our belief that liberty is a transforming moment in the history of the world. I talk about a stronger and better America; it means our economy needs to be strong. One of the things we better make sure is we do not raise the taxes on the people. I am going to talk about good education policy to help train workers. I will talk about energy policy to make sure we are not that we are less dependent on foreign sources of energy. Of course, I am going to talk about liability reform, medical liability reform. I will talk about tort reform, so our business people can thrive and hire people. And there are policies we need to put in place to make sure this is the best place in the world to do business. If you want jobs to stay in America, like I do, this better be a place where people feel comfortable taking risks and expanding the job base. So I have spent a lot of time talking about that in the course of the campaign. Today we are going to talk about how to encourage an ownership society in America.

At any rate, when we think about it, it was a different society back a couple of decades ago because a person stayed with the same company, had the health plan from the company, retirement plan from the company. You have got moms and dads that are both working, sometimes out of the house. And the economy is changing, and therefore, Government policy ought to change with the times. And one way to bring stability and security into a person's life is to encourage ownership. See, if you own and control your own health care plan, you can move from job to job without worrying as to whether or not you are going to get health coverage for your family. If you own your own home and building equity in your own home and you are changing from job to job, it provides great security and relief. And so we are going to talk about different forms of ownership here. But the point here is, I want you to understand that over the next 4 years we will be working to build a culture of ownership in America. We want more people owning things in this country. Let me put it to you bluntly. In a changing world, we want more people to have control over your own life. And that is a difference there is a difference in philosophy, when you think about it. A lot of the Government policies are, you know as I like to put it, we will give you the orders, and you pay the bills. If you really think about it, there is a philosophical divide here in this campaign. My judgment is, Government ought to be empowering people by giving them more control over their lives. And we will talk about some practical ways to do that. Now, look, one of the things we will always work to do is to take care of those people who cannot help themselves. As a matter of fact, a proper policy of Government is to give people the tools necessary to be able to realize their own dreams. It is making a big difference. I am telling you, when you start asking the question, Can you read and write and add and subtract? It holds people to account. We have got to end this it is a mediocre system when you quit on kids basically because of the color of their skin, you know? We are not going to do that anymore in America.

We need to make sure that we are staying on the cutting edge of new technologies. But we are going to have to make some serious decisions. I can tell you that the budget is going to end up saving $400 billion or so. And it will mean that domestic discretionary spending goes down to the lowest level since Dwight Eisenhower, since -- lower -- lowest level -- the lowest level since I was born, certainly since you were born. Well, you mentioned education as an area that would not get cut. Let us go to the category of education. This question comes from a charter school in. you said that many of the social and economic disparities that exist in the African-American community can be -- and I quote -- directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. How do you plan on addressing these social and economic disparities that currently exist in minority communities? In particular, what is your plan to close the pervasive achievement gap in education for American minorities today? Well, the first thing that we have got to remember -- and I said this at the State of the Union -- is that nothing government does replaces the importance of parents in education. And so all of us, regardless of our station, our race, where -- what region of the country we are coming from, if we are parents, we have got to step up our game in working with our kids to learn -- reading to them, turning off the TV, making sure they are doing their homework. You know, building a culture around the love of learning is critical. But our schools have a special role to play, obviously. And the single most important thing that we can do in closing the achievement gap is making sure that we have got good teachers in the classroom that are setting high expectations for our kids. And, you know, one of the challenges we have is a lot of times in poorer neighborhoods, higher minority student populations, oftentimes the teachers do not have as much experience in the subject matter that they are teaching.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegroveyoutube", "title": "Interview With Steve Grove of YouTube", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-youtube", "publication_date": "27-01-2011", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 2103, "text": "You know, in a lot of communities we need to provide more incentives for the best teachers to teach in the hardest-to-teach schools, as opposed to a lot of times their impulse, particularly if they have seniority, is to go to suburban schools or -- in wealthier communities, where the kids are better prepared. And that is understandable, but we have got to put a special focus on making sure that those schools that really need help are getting the best possible resources. One of the things we are doing with what is called Race to the Top, the program that Secretary Duncan and myself have been promoting, is we are saying to states, you get some additional money if you have got a real good game plan for those lowest-performing schools, and we do not want any child out there not having the best possible chance at succeeding. And one of the reasons it is so important to close the achievement gap is, the population is going to be increasingly Hispanic, increasingly African-American -- those are fast-growing populations -- increasingly Asian, and so if we are not doing a great job educating those kids and closing some of those achievement gaps, we are going to have problems as a country. You mentioned Race to the Top. And a lot of people wrote in about Race to the Top -- ENTITY, where are you going to get the money to fund Race to the Top? And how do you expect schools with depleted resources to actually compete for this funding? Well, keep in mind, Race to the Top only costs 1 percent of what we spend overall on education. That is the wonderful thing about the program is schools are still getting general support that is formula-based, meaning that each state, depending on its population and the number of children it has that are in low-income categories, are getting a certain amount of federal money. All we are saying is, let us carve out a little bit of this money and create a contest among states saying, if you have got the best plan to improve teacher quality, make sure that you are setting high performance, if you are setting up a way of tracking whether or not the kids are doing well -- if you do that, then we will give you a little bit of extra.

You know, I will tell you that lately my favorite mathematicians and scientists are actually folks that are not very well known. I get a chance to meet them on a pretty regular basis through what is called PCAST. It is my -- ENTITY's council on science and technology, essentially. John Holdren, my chief science adviser, is the lead on it.

Well, let me say first of all that, you know, Egypt's been an ally of ours on a lot of critical issues. They made peace with Israel. President Mubarak has been very helpful on a range of tough issues in the Middle East. But I have always said to him that making sure that they are moving forward on reform -- political reform, economic reform -- is absolutely critical to the long-term -- well being of Egypt. And you can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets. My main hope right now is, is that violence is not the answer in solving these problems in Egypt. So the government has to be careful about not resorting to violence, and the people on the streets have to be careful about not resorting to violence. And I think that it is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances. freedom of speech, freedom of expression, people being able to use social networking or any other mechanisms to communicate with each other and express their concerns.

ENTITY, disrupting, dismantling and defeating al-Qaida and preventing its capacity to threaten the United States and our allies in the future is how you have defined our objective in Afghanistan. How do preventative wars costing the lives of innocent civilians in countries that have not attacked us distance your foreign policy from the Bush Doctrine or disprove the assertion of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s that the United States is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world? Well, Dennis's question, I am not sure I buy into the premise. Our work in Afghanistan is precisely because that is -- was the launching pad from which 9/11 happened and 3,000 Americans were killed. So we are not over there by accident. Obviously, I disagreed with us going into Iraq, but I will say that we are bringing the war in Iraq to a honorable conclusion because of the extraordinary service of our men and women, both military and civilian in Iraq. We have still got work to do in this transition, but by the end of this year, we will have all our troops out. And the Iraq -- the Iraqi people now have a government that they will be looking to for governance and development. In Afghanistan, we have al-Qaida and its allies. We have them along the border region in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and it is my job as president to make sure that they cannot launch another 9/11 against us. Over the next couple of years, we are going to be transitioning so that we are bringing troops back. Afghans are taking a greater lead. The situation's not going to be perfect there, but what we have been able to do is to continually shrink the ability of al-Qaida to launch operations.

So what will you do different in order to remove us from foreign oil and put us on the path towards renewable and clean green energy? This is why we have made such a big emphasis on this in my State of the Union speech, and I talked about it yesterday as I said, part of it is just creating a market. Right. because it is new and not enough people are buying it. And if you have to make it one at a time, then it is expensive. But if you start being able to make a hundred thousand of them or 200,000 of them, then the unit costs of each one go down. The same is true with clean energy. So what we have got to do is make sure that there is a market for entrepreneurs out there. And that is why something like a clean-energy standard is so important. You know, it was not one of our official categories, I will be honest with you, but we got a lot of questions on drug policy.

Well, I think this is an -- a entirely legitimate topic for debate. I am not in favor of legalization. I am a strong believer that we have to think more about drugs as a public health problem. When you think about other damaging activities in our society -- smoking, drunk driving, making sure you are wearing seatbelts -- you know, typically we have made huge strides over the last 20, 30 years by changing people's attitudes.

Well, the -- some of this requires shifting resources, being strategic; where does it make sense for us to really focus on interdiction? We have to go after drug cartels that not only are selling drugs but also creating havoc, for example, along the U.S.-Mexican border. But are there ways that we can also shrink demand? You know, in some cities, for example, it may take six months for you to get into a drug treatment program. Well, if you are trying to kick a habit and somebody says to you, well, come back in six months, that is pretty discouraging. And so we have got to do more in figuring out how can we get some resources on that end of it and make sure that -- and also look at what we are doing when we have nonviolent first-time drug offenders; are there ways that we can make sure that we are steering them into the straight and narrow without automatically resorting to incarceration, drug courts, mechanisms like that?

Well, the main reason is, is that Canada, Mexico, their governments are both purchasers of these drugs, and so they negotiate much cheaper prices with the drug companies. We still do not do that. It would save us money. Now, the -- the drug companies, as part of health care reform last year, did agree to essentially put in more money for prescription drugs for seniors, make them cheaper. That was the subject of compromise through the legislative process.  Well, actually, if -- depending on Noah's circumstances, if he is getting prescription drugs through the Medicare program, then our laws -- what we are doing is we are closing the doughnut hole, which is that portion of the law that said, at a certain point, you start paying full price for your drugs. So we are making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors, and we are going to be phasing out that doughnut hole over the next several years. So Noah may be helped if he is getting these drugs through Medicare. If he is getting them through a private insurer, then we have still got to do more work in the private health care plans to figure out how we can cheapen drugs, and it may be that importation is -- is still something that we -- we should look at in terms of further lowering the price of drugs. Another top-voted healthcare question had to do with something that I know your wife is very passionate about, and it is from ENTITY. I live in Brooklyn, New York. Right now, we live in a country where it is cheaper to feed our kids Froot Loops than it is to feed them fruit. I'd like to know, what are you going to do to reverse that? Well, the -- you know, the main thing I have done is I -- I have the first lady, who is just driving this -- this issue in an incredible way all across the country. Mm-hmm.

That is good for the farmer. It is good for retail stores in underserved communities. And ultimately, it is good for the consumer. The child nutrition bill that we just passed is similarly working with schools to figure out how can we make sure that you are not just serving tater tots and pizza all day long.

So all these things are geared towards making local produce, fresh produce, much more available and cheaper to every family and not just families who can afford to go into high-end supermarkets.

ENTITY, my name is ENTITY, and I am a DREAM Act ENTITY currently studying to become a nurse at City College of San Francisco. Last year, my house was raided by ICE, and I was incarcerated for two months in a detention center in Arizona, awaiting my deportation to Peru. I was able return to my friends and family when Senator Feinstein agreed to introduce bill to stop my deportation to Peru. The Senate has failed to pass the DREAM Act because of partisan politics. ENTITY, will you help us make sure that there is a moratorium to stop the deportation of innocent students who qualify for the DREAM Act? Well, you know, Steve's an example of what I talked about at the State of the Union address. We have got incredibly talented young people who grow up as Americans, pledge allegiance to our flag and are now at risk of deportation not because of anything they did but because their parents brought them here as young children and they did not have their legal papers. And so I am a strong supporter of the DREAM Act. The reason I spoke about it during the State of the Union is because I think we should still be able to get Democrats and Republicans to work together to solve this problem. I want somebody like Steve to study to be a nurse and be able to contribute to our society.

And we can reconcile those two values, but we are going to have to do it together. Let us move to our last question. This comes from ENTITY in Syracuse, New York. ENTITY, after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the young people in the nation were challenged with learning maths and sciences so that the country could compete. What does America need from my generation to still be great when it is time to hand it to our kids? Well, I talked about winning the future. I think that is what every American wants to see. Obviously, we are concerned about the immediate problems of unemployment, coming out of the recession. But -- but what we also want to feel confident about is that 10 years from now, 15 years from now, 20 years from now, America is still at the top when it comes to technology, when it comes to innovation, when it comes to a dynamic economy. And I am absolutely convinced that we can do it. But in order to accomplish it, we are going to have to out-build, out-educate, out-innovate every other country. That is what we have always done. We are -- we are going to have a government that is trimming its deficits, living within its means. It is got to be updated for the 21st century. But the most important thing we have to do is to make sure that young people like Tom are getting the best education possible; that young engineers and scientists, they have the resources to -- to create new products and new technologies; that we have got an economy that is dynamic and rewards success, but also an economy that benefits from the best transportation systems, the best Internet systems, the best roads and bridges and airports. And -- and so, the -- the goal over the next couple of years is to make sure that, even as we are reducing our deficit, dealing with our debt, that we are still making some core investments that are going to prepare us for the future.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegroveyoutube", "title": "Interview With Steve Grove of YouTube", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-youtube", "publication_date": "27-01-2011", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

My name is ENTITY, and I am ENTITY of news and politics at YouTube. We had a chance to do this before I was elected and had a great time, so I am glad we can do it again. Well, let us tell people a little bit about how this works. Five days ago, as you were delivering your State of the Union address, we opened up our Moderator platform on YouTube, where thousands of people have been submitting and voting on both video and text questions. Some of them, as you will see, were hard-hitting. But all of the questions you will see here today were voted into the top tier of the thousands of questions we received. And none of them have been chosen by the White House or seen by ENTITY. This should be a lot of fun. ENTITY, let us let Lehman Marcus in Silver Spring, Maryland, kick us off. He submitted this video to remind us of where things were a year ago. Marcus writes, ENTITY, I know there have been political setbacks to getting health-care reform done, but the 40 million people who have no insurance cannot wait. Will they be able to get insurance this year? We now have a bill that is come out from the House, come out from the Senate. And if you look at the core components of that legislation, what you have is 30 million people who get coverage, insurance reform so that people who have health insurance are going to be able to be protected from not being able to get it because of preexisting conditions, or suddenly losing their health care because, you know, the insurance company has some fine print that they did not read. It makes sure that we actually start bending the cost curve, controlling the rising premiums by instituting better practices in terms of how we reimburse doctors and how we ask hospitals to work together. We have already invested in electronic IT, electronic medical records, things that can help make the system more efficient. So we have this enormous opportunity. But the way the rules work in the United States Senate, you have got to have 60 votes for everything.

My hope is -- is that they accept that invitation and that they work with us together over the next several weeks to get it done. Yeah. And the number-one question we got in health care came from Mr. Anderson in Texas, who asked, why are the health-care meetings and procedures not on C- SPAN, as promised? And then one of the top questions in the government reform category was Warren Hunter in Brooklyn, who said, how do you expect people in this country to trust you when you have repeatedly broken promises that were made on the campaign trail, most recently the promise to have a transparent health-care debate? Well, I -- I guess -- first of all, I would say that we have been certified by independent groups as the most transparent White House in history. We are the first White House since the founding of the republic to list every visitor that comes into the White House online so that you can look it up. People know more about the inner workings of this White House, the meetings we have. We have excluded lobbyists from boards and commissions. But we also report on any lobbyist who meets with anybody who is part of our -- part of our administration. So we have actually followed through on a lot of the commitments that we have made. And so Warren's mistaken in terms of how he characterized it. What is fair to say is that as the health-care process went forward, not every single aspect of it was on C-SPAN. Now, keep in mind, most of the action was in Congress. So every committee hearing that was taking place, both in the House and the Senate, those were all widely televised. The only ones that were not were meetings that I had with some of the legislative leadership, trying to get a sense from them in terms of what it was that they were trying to do. I have acknowledged that. And that is why as we move forward, making sure that in this last leg, these last five yards before we get to the goal line, that everybody understands exactly what is going on in the health care bill -- that there are no surprises, no secrets -- that is going to be an imperative.

{"id": 2115, "text": "You know, the central focus of your State of the Union was obviously jobs. And a lot of people wrote in asking for some clarity around some of your plans for small businesses. I want to play you two video questions in a row. One year ago today, my wife and I were both let go from our jobs in corporate American within 48 hours of each other. We have since started a small business. And we employ a couple of people around us. What is being done to free up funding and encourage the growth of all the small businesses that have such a tremendous impact on our economy? how exactly are you planning on helping small businesses grow and prosper, besides simply providing tax breaks? Well, let me start with some specific issues that confront every small business all across the country. And it is absolutely true that if we can get small businesses back on their feet, then that is going to go a long way towards bringing the unemployment rate down, because that is the fastest generator of jobs across the country. Number one, small businesses really are still struggling with financing. You hear stories everywhere you go that even profitable, successful businesses are having trouble getting financing, because banks frankly just do not want to take the risk. After having taken way too many risk before, now they are taking no risk. And small businesses are punished for that. So we have expanded the SBA loan, the Small Business Administration loan, portfolio by about 70 percent. We have been waiving guarantees and fees, trying to streamline the process, just to get more capital into the hands of small businesses. It is important to see if we can give more incentives to small business. So, for example, we are just eliminating capital gains for small businesses, which is particularly important if you have got a start-up. Ten years from now, you may end up being successful with your small business, but suddenly you have got to pay taxes on it. If you can take that money and, instead of paying Uncle Sam, reinvest it in your business, you can grow it further. So we think that that is the kind of strategy that makes a lot of sense. We want to also make sure that we are providing tax credits for hiring of small businesses -- small businesses that are hiring new employees. And so we have got a whole range of proposals there. Now, in addition to the tax credits, in addition to the financing, one of the other things that, frankly, small businesses need is just a economic environment that is growing.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegroveyoutube0", "title": "Interview With Steve Grove on YouTube", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-youtube-0", "publication_date": "01-02-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 2116, "text": "And one of the things we are very proud of is the fact that we had a 6-percent contraction of the economy at the beginning of last year; this past quarter we had a 6-percent increase in the growth of the economy. That 12-percent swing offers greater opportunities for small businesses to prosper and thrive. One of the biggest burdens on small businesses is health-care costs. And probably nobody benefits more from our health-care proposals than small businesses, because what we are doing is we are saying that not only will you get tax credits to buy health insurance, but we are also going to let you pool, buy in to a big exchange so that you have the same purchasing power as a big company like -- Ford or, you know, Google is able to negotiate with insurance companies and get a good deal. Well, now small businesses, by pooling together in this exchange, are going to have that same leverage. That will help lower their costs. And for a lot of small businesses, it is not just a matter of giving health insurance to your employees; it is also just being able to buy health insurance for yourself. That will cut down on small businesses' costs and they will be able to, again, invest more in their business. You know, a lot of Americans saw what happened on Wall Street this past year, and they wrote in saying, you know, When are we going to get OUR bailout? Here is ENTITY from Florida, who submitted the number-one video question in the financial reform category. ENTITY, my name is ENTITY , from South Florida. I have a question about your -- program and why the banks are reluctant to modify loans of homeowners who can afford to stay in their homes. Now that taxpayers bailed them out, they refuse to help us out. And I would like to know what say you, ENTITY. Well, look, this is something that we have been dealing with since the beginning of this financial crisis. We set up a program for loan modification that so far about 4 million people have taken advantage of across the country. You have got about 800,000 people who have gotten loan modifications that are saving them an average of $550. The problem is -- is the number of people whose mortgages are underwater, here they actually have a home value that is now less than their mortgage, is a lot bigger than that.

{"id": 2117, "text": "So the amount of money that we have been able to get into this program has not met the entire need. We are now pushing the banks as hard as we can to make sure that not only do they do the most with the resources that we have been giving them, but that they also do a much better job of customer service with people who are coming to them. I get letters all the time of people who've gone through all kinds of hoops, filled out forms; the bank does not call them back, or after they have gone through a trial period, the bank says, Well, you know, we now think we should not give you a home modification. What we are trying to do is to increase transparency and force all the banks to tell us exactly what are you doing with your customers who want to stay in their homes, can afford to pay a mortgage but need something a little bit more limited. And I am -- I am hopeful that we are going to continue to see more and more people take advantage of it. Given the magnitude of the housing problem out there, that there are still going to be pockets of areas where the housing values have dropped so much that it is still going to be tough for a lot of people, and we are just going to have to work our way through this as the economy improves. ENTITY, let us lighten things up for a minute. We got a lot of people just submitting their ideas to you -- ideas for how to make the country better. They want to hear what you thought about them. Let us play sort of a faster round of a thing we will call Good Idea, Bad Idea. I will show you an idea. You say whether you think it is good or bad, and maybe just a few sentences about why you think that. First one comes from Aloha Tony in your home state of Hawaii. He says, ENTITY, our deficit is higher than ever, at $12 trillion. Will you consider allowing the private sector to buy and take over the most troubled government-run agencies, such as the U.S. Postal Service? There are examples where privatization makes sense, where people can do things much more efficiently.

But do they want to deliver that postcard to a remote area somewhere in rural America that is a money-loser? Well, the U.S. Post Office provides universal service. Those companies would not want to provide universal service. My car-insurance company will allow me to take driver's ed classes to reduce my monthly premiums. Can we do the same thing for health insurance -- take classes in cooking, nutrition, stress management, communication, parenting, stopping smoking, maybe even exercise classes, and get a reduction on our monthly premiums? Well, I -- I think that the idea is a good one, and that is that if people are being healthy, that they should be able to get some incentives for that. And a lot of companies are starting to do that. We probably do not want the insurance companies, though, making those decisions, because insurance companies have every incentive to take the youngest, healthiest people and insure them, since they are less likely to have to pay out, and then leave older, sicker individuals out of their insurance pools. So it is important in any health-care program to make sure that the young and the healthy and the older and -- and the sicker are in a single pool. But what we should encourage are individual companies who provide incentives for wellness programs, smoking-cessation programs -- you know, that they are going to get a workout once in a while. Those things are something that we should encourage. And, you know, the first lady, Michelle ENTITY, she is really focusing right now on childhood wellness, healthy eating, getting exercise. That is a campaign that she is going to be pushing all year long. Let us get one more idea in here. This next one comes from Jay Leavers in Dover, Delaware, who writes, do you think it'd be worth looking at placing solar panels in all federal, state and school buildings as a way to cut energy costs and put that budget money to better use?

Well, let us move back to the questions. And I have got to tell you, the number-one question that came in, in the jobs and economy category, had to do with the Internet. And it came from James -- Indianapolis. He said, an open Internet is a powerful engine for economic growth and new jobs. Letting large companies block and filter online content and services would stifle needed growth. What is your commitment to keeping Internet open and neutral in America? Well, I am a big believer in net neutrality. I campaigned on this. I continue to be a strong supporter of it. My FCC chairman, Julius Genachowski, has indicated that he shares the view that we have got to keep the Internet open, that we do not want to create a bunch of gateways that prevent somebody who does not have a lot of money but has a good idea from being able to start their next YouTube or their next Google on the Internet. We are getting pushback, obviously, from some of the bigger carriers who would like to be able to charge more fees and extract more money from wealthier customers, but we think that runs counter to the whole spirit of openness that has made the Internet such a powerful engine for not only economic growth, but also for the generation of ideas and creativity. Well, you know, to get good jobs, I think many Americans realize they need a higher education. Here is a video question from Saginaw, Michigan. Dear ENTITY, as ENTITY who has 14 credits and three part-time jobs, just was wondering, what are your plans for -- plans to lower college tuition costs? You know, I know we are in a struggling economy right now, but any little bit that you can help would be appreciated. Well, ENTITY is right that, you know, college tuition costs are just crushing on a lot of folks. And this is something I remember from my own experience, because Michelle and I, we had college loans we kept on paying off for a decade after we had graduated from law school. We have already done a huge amount to increase Pell grants, to help increase the accessibility of college loans and grants at the college level, but we want to do more.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegroveyoutube0", "title": "Interview With Steve Grove on YouTube", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-youtube-0", "publication_date": "01-02-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 2120, "text": "And so we have put forward an initiative that is being debated in Congress and we hope to get passed this year, where if you have student loans, that you will not have to pay more than 10 percent of your income on those loans; that after 20 years, they will be forgiven; and if you have gone into public service, they will be forgiven after 10 years. That would provide a huge amount of relief for people. We still need to expand more the Pell grant program, make it both accessible to more people and raise the amount of tuition. In order to pay for this -- the best part of this is we can actually figure out how to pay for it, because right now you have got a lot of banks and financial-service companies who are still middlemen in the federally guaranteed loan programs. And if we can cut those middlemen out, then you have got several billion dollars that you can invest in the programs that I just described. This is something that I have made a top priority. I want us to once again have the highest college-graduation rates of any country in the world by 2020. Colleges and universities also, though, have to figure out how can they cut their costs. Because even if we are putting more and more loans in -- more and more money for loans, if the inflation in higher education keeps on skyrocketing, over time it is still going to gobble up all that extra money, and we will be right back where we started. So we have got to show more restraint at the college and university level in terms of ever- escalating costs. Well, let us back up a bit just from the specifics of education policy, and ask a more fundamental question, which comes from ENTITY in Ohio. As a math teacher, I want to know what you think it means to be an educated person. We know that if you have got a college education, you are going to make multiples of what you would make as a high school graduate, much less a high school dropout, over the course of lifetime. But its absolutely true that a high-quality education is not just a matter of being a good worker, it is also a matter of being a good citizen, it is also a matter of being able to think critically, evaluate the world around you, make sure that you can process all the information that is coming at us in a way that helps you make decisions about your own life, but also helps you participate in the life of the country.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegroveyoutube0", "title": "Interview With Steve Grove on YouTube", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-youtube-0", "publication_date": "01-02-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And I think that that requires more than just rote learning, although, you know, it certainly requires good habits and discipline in school. It also requires that in the classroom, they are getting the kind of creative teaching that is so important. And that is why our administration's initiated something called Race to the Top, where my secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, has helped to design a competition among states so that they can foster the kinds of excellence in learning everywhere, not just in some schools, not just in some states, but in every school in every state. If states want money, we are going to reward excellence.

You know, al Qaeda is probably the biggest killer of innocent Muslims of any entity out there. Now, they employ terrorist tactics. And we have to fight them on all fronts. We have to fight them in very concrete ways in Afghanistan and along the border regions of Pakistan, where they are still holed up. They have spread to places like Yemen and Somalia.

So we want to use all of our national power to deal with the problem of these extremist organizations. But part of that does involve applications of military power. And that is why although it is the hardest decision that a commander in chief can make, to send our troops into battle, I thought it was very important to make sure that we had an additional 30,000 troops in Afghanistan, to help train Afghan forces, so that they can start providing more effective security for their own country, in dealing with the Taliban, and ultimately allow us to remove our troops but still have a secure partner there that is not going to be able to use that region as a platform to attack the United States.

What will you do to galvanize the international community to ensure that widespread violence does not occur in Sudan this year? Well, the situation -- Sudan has been heartbreaking, but also extremely difficult, and something that we started working on the day that I came into office. Our first task was, at that time, making sure that people who were in refugee camps in Darfur had access to basic water, food, other necessities of life. And this was after the Sudanese government in Khartoum had kicked out a whole bunch of nongovernmental organizations that were providing assistance there. We were able to get that assistance back in to help at least initially stabilize the situation. The next step in the challenge is to broker a lasting peace agreement between rebels who are still in the Darfur region and this -- this government.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegroveyoutube0", "title": "Interview With Steve Grove on YouTube", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-youtube-0", "publication_date": "01-02-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 2123, "text": "And I have got a special envoy who has been very active in trying to bring together the international community to get that deal brokered. Part of what makes it complicated is, you also have a conflict historically between northern Sudan and southern Sudan. They finally reached a agreement after a lot of work, but the Sudanese now -- the southern Sudanese now have an option where they may be seeking to secede from all of Sudan. That is another potential conflict that could create additional millions of refugees. And so what we are doing is trying to work with not only the regional powers, but the United Nations and other countries that have shown a great interest in this to see if we can broker a series of agreements that would stabilize the country, and then allow the refugees who are in Darfur to start moving back to their historic lands. Sadly, because of the genocide that took place earlier, a lot of those villages are now destroyed. And so thinking about how to resettle these populations in places that are viable economically, that have the resources to support populations, is a long-term development challenge that the international community is going to have to support. We continue to put pressure on the Sudanese government. If they are not cooperative in these efforts, then it is going to be appropriate for us to conclude that engagement does not work. And you know, we are going to have to apply additional pressure on Sudan in order to -- in order to achieve our objectives. But my hope is, is that we can broker agreements with all the parties involved to deal with what has been an enormous human tragedy in that region. Another question we missed from the deck, but it was about Guantanamo. And essentially, a user's saying, why is it taking so long to close down Guantanamo? Number one, you have got a whole bunch of individuals in Guantanamo, some of whom are very dangerous, some of whom were low- level fighters, some of whom the courts have determined should never have been put there in the first place. We have had to evaluate each of those cases -- hundreds of cases -- one by one to determine what these various categories are, and do it in a way that stands up to our standards of due process and legal scrutiny. Then we have got to figure out, if we are closing Guantanamo, where are we going to put them?", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevegroveyoutube0", "title": "Interview With Steve Grove on YouTube", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-grove-youtube-0", "publication_date": "01-02-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

But unfortunately, there has been a lot of political resistance, and you know, frankly, some of it just politically motivated; some of it people being legitimately scared about, Well, if we have got somebody who we have been told is a terrorist in our backyard, will that make us a target? One of the things that we have had to try to communicate to the country at large is that historically we have tried a lot of terrorists in our courts. We have them in our federal prisons. But it is been one of those things that is been subject to a lot of, in some cases, you know, pretty rank politics. And you know, we have got to work through that process because Congress ultimately controls the purse strings in creating new facilities. If Congress makes a decision that they are going to try to block the opening of a new facility, it potentially constrains what our administration can do. And so this is something that we have got to work through both in Congress but also with public opinion, so that people understand that ultimately this is the right thing to do; by closing Guantanamo, we can regain the moral high ground in the battle against these terrorist organizations. There is been no bigger propaganda weapon for many of these extremists than pointing to Guantanamo and saying that we do not live up to our own ideals. And that is something that I strongly believe we have to resist, even if it has some costs to it and even if it is not always the most politically popular thing to do. ENTITY, we do not have much time left, but I want to make sure we get to the issue of energy, the environment. One of the rare moments where you were able to get applause from your friends on the Republican side of the aisle in Congress the other night was when you mentioned nuclear energy. And just today your budget announced tripling the loan guarantees for nuclear reactors. A lot of people had questions about just how this will work and why you did that. ENTITY, record numbers of young people elected you, in support of a clean-energy future. If money is tight, why do you propose wasting billions in expensive nuclear, dirty coal and offshore drilling?

{"id": 2125, "text": "Well, you are not going to get any argument from me about the need to create clean-energy jobs. I think this is going to be the driver of our economy over the long term. And that is why we put in record amounts of money for solar and wind and biodiesel and all the other alternative, clean-energy sources that are out there. In the meantime, though, unfortunately, no matter how fast we ramp up those energy sources, we are still going to have enormous energy needs that will be unmet by alternative energy. And the question then is, where -- where will that come from? Nuclear energy has the advantage of not emitting greenhouse gases. For those who are concerned about climate change, we have to recognize that countries like Japan and France and others have been much more aggressive in their nuclear industry, and much more successful in having that a larger part of their portfolio, without incident, without accidents. We are mindful of the concerns about storage of spent fuel and concerns about security. But we still think it is the right thing to do, if we are serious about dealing with climate change. With respect to clean-coal technology, it is not possible at this point to completely eliminate coal from the menu of our energy options. And if we are ever going to deal with climate change in a serious way, where we know China and India are going to be greatly reliant on coal, we have got to start developing clean-coal technologies that can sequester the harmful emissions; because otherwise, countries like China and India are not going to stop using coal, we will still have those same problems, but we will not have the technology to make sure that it does not harm the environment over the long term. So I know that there is some skepticism about whether there is such a thing as clean-coal technology. What is true is right now, that we do not have all the technology to prevent greenhouse gas emissions from a coal -- coal-powered -- power plants. But the technology is close, and it makes sense for us to make that investment now, not only because it'll be good for America, but it will also ultimately be good internationally. We can license and export that technology in ways that help other countries use a better form of energy that is going to be helpful to the climate-change issue.

Remember-let us start with affirmative action-remember, there was a lot of pressure to eliminate affirmative action, both from the Republican Party and from some court decisions, which required us to change it. And we took the position that we should mend it, not end it, and that is the position that Vice President Gore has steadily defended. I noticed in his third debate that he was the only candidate who would say that he was for affirmative action. And I can tell you, we had long, long discussions about this. He believes strongly in it. And I believe virtually every one of our candidates for the Senate and the House does. I know that my wife, who is running for the Senate in New York, strongly feels that way, and I believe all the others do, as well. So I think you can feel very good about that.

They want to provide funds to poor school districts especially, and growing school districts, to build new school buildings and to overhaul others. They want to finish the work of connecting all the schools in the country to the Internet and all the classrooms. When Al Gore took on this project for our administration in 1994, only 3 percent of the classrooms were connected. Today, 65 percent of the classrooms are, and 90 percent of the poorest schools have at least one Internet connection. So we want to do that. He wants to provide universal preschool and more after-school programs for the kids who need it, and he wants tax deductibility for college tuition. Plus which, we have a Hispanic Education Action Plan that is designed to deal with the fact that the dropout rate among Latino students is still too high, and he has promised to build on that. So we have got a very, very good education program. It is been our top domestic priority, and I think you can really depend on the Vice President to deliver. That is why both the major teachers' organizations have endorsed him, and a lot of other educators around the country, because they believe that we have a program based on the research and what the educators are saying. He has got a good accountability program that we ought to identify failing schools, turn them around, or open them under new management. And all over America, you see these schools that were in trouble just a couple of years ago that are turning around. I was in a school in Harlem the other day where 2 years ago, 80 percent of the children were doing math and reading below grade level, and today, three-quarters of the kids are doing math and reading above or at grade level. That is after only 2 years. So we have got a program that is working out there at the grassroots. We need to bring it to all of America, and you can trust Al Gore to do that. He cares a lot about it.

We also set up this scholarship fund and did some other things that we hope will be a genuine gesture of our regret. It was a very-you know, I had a good talk with him. Any particular reason why you used the word regret instead of apology in your statement? I think the findings were- I think he knows that regret and apology both mean the same thing, in terms of being profoundly sorry for what happened. But I believe that the people who looked into it could not conclude that there was a deliberate act, decided at a high enough level in the military hierarchy, to acknowledge that, in effect, the Government had participated in something that was terrible. So I do not think there is any difference in the two words, on a human level, because we are profoundly sorry that it happened and sorry that any Americans were involved in it. But I think that in terms of the kind of responsibility the institution of the military that the facts were sufficiently unclear after all this time that the people who were reviewing it thought it was the appropriate language.

They need to get all they can get from out-of-State generators and in-State generators, because they have grown so much. And they still have a regulation of prices to the ultimate consumer. So we have got a situation here which it seems to me might have been predictable at the time the deregulation legislation was done. But I, frankly, until this happened, I did not know what the nature of the California deregulation law was. So we are dealing with the situation the best we can. But I also think we need to talk to some of the producers, see whether more power can be brought on line at economical rates more quickly.

It worked very well for a couple of years, but there had to be some continued movement. Because what happens is, when you reach a stall, then the people that really do not want this to happen, particularly rejectionist elements within the Palestinian community, they can have incidents; then they provoke reactions; then the borders get closed; then the incomes of the Palestinians drop again, and you get in a downward spiral.

Do you think it is important for you to set out a list of, maybe, points that have been agreed to so far, so that they do not start from scratch again, that you do not lose what you have already gotten? Well, I think it was quite significant, actually, even though it came 6 days later than I wanted it to, that the Palestinians have now agreed in principle with the parameters. So at least that Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority have agreed-this Israeli government, excuse me-and the Palestinian Authority have agreed to the parameters.

And I think it is very important that we-except in the most extreme circumstances-maintain some continuity in foreign policy and in our commitments to other countries. But President-elect Bush is in no way, shape, or form bound by the positions I have taken on this Middle East agreement, unless there is some agreement. In all my 8 years of service as ENTITY, I have never seen a situation quite like this, where the circumstances, including my short time in office, seemed unfavorable, but the determination of the main players seems strong, in fact, maybe even intensified. I am trying to keep myself free of expectation one way or the other, and to do whatever I can to try to help end the violence-and we had a good day today-and just create the conditions in which, if they are willing, they can do as much as they can do. I do not think we can predict it. Do you think the incoming Bush people will be as interested in pursuing this as you have been? Well, I think they will be very interested in stability and peace in the Middle East. Their orientation has been a little more toward, you know, the Gulf, the oil-producing states, honoring our historic commitments to Israel to maintain their qualitative military capacity. But to be fair, the previous Bush administration took a pretty strong line on expanded settlements after the Madrid talks started in the hope that they could help to create the conditions in which the Palestinians and the Israelis could move toward peace. So I think that there may be differences in approach and priorities that the President and the Vice President and Secretary Powell will have to work through. But my guess is that their general direction will be the same, because in the end, what happens is-let us assume-and I am not saying this, because I do not believe this-but listen, even if you had an administration that did not really care about the Palestinian problem on its own merits and said, Well, our real interests are in the geopolitics of the oilproducing states and the problems created by the lack of an agreement with Syria.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevehollandanddebbiecharlesreuters", "title": "William J.

We worked this hard, I mean, for years. And I think if the late President Asad had not kind of felt he was not in the best of health and was not- that they wanted to freeze things in place, and if he can secure his son's accession, we might well have been able to do a peace agreement when I met with him in Switzerland shortly before his death. So even if it is not a priority for you because it looks like a morass that cannot be solved in a small place with people that do not have a state, do not have nuclear arms, do not have an air force, do not have an army, inevitably what we always get back to is that the absence of an agreement with the Palestinians and the absence of a stable situation between Israel and the Palestinians infects the other countries and their capacity to relate to us over the long run. And particularly as these other countries have more and more young people who are more and more drawn to the sympathetic-drawn with a sympathetic ear to the claims of the Palestinians, and they have more demonstrations in these other countries and more unrest in these other countries, I think that our concern for stability in our relations with the Saudis, with the Kuwaitis, with not letting Saddam Hussein develop weapons of mass destruction again, the whole range of concerns that any American administration would have to have leads you back down to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and trying to get to the end of the road there. I think that that is why I made the speech I did to the Israeli Policy Forum the other night. I waited until the very end, and until, essentially, I had put these parameters out before saying that, because I do not believe an American ENTITY should try to impose or create a peace between these two parties. The questions go too much to the heart of their respective sense of national identities, their cultural identity, their whole set of religious convictions.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevehollandanddebbiecharlesreuters", "title": "William J.

{"id": 2135, "text": "So all I said in these parameters and all I meant to say in the Israel Policy Forum speech is, Look, I have been listening to these people for 8 years, and I have studied these issues as closely, I believe, as any American President ever has, down to the maps, the settlement locations, the maps of the city of Jerusalem, the whole thing. My best judgment is if there ever is going to be a comprehensive agreement, it will have to look something like this. In other words, they could do what they did at Wye River. They could say, Okay, here is the next chapter, and this is what we are going to do. But the real problem with the sort of sequencing of interim steps is that, at least so far, because of all the other very complex forces going on there, these steps have not brought sufficient stability to the relationship and to the climate within the Palestinian areas or within Israel that there can be a long-term sort of set of nonpolitical measures that lead to progress-which is exactly the reverse of the Irish situation. And you may have heard me say this before, but the difference is, in Ireland-I may have said this in the Israel Policy Forum speech, I cannot remember-but my physical analogy is, some unsolved problems are like scabs on a wound. If you leave them alone, they will heal. Some are like an abscessed tooth. If you leave it alone, it will get lots worse. In Ireland, because the underlying economic circumstances are dramatically improved and because there has been a dramatic increase in interpersonal contact which is positive, and because while there is a small terrorist group that is still trying to upset the Irish thing, it is much more contained, the absence of final resolution of the thorny political issues is unlikely to crater the situation. In the Middle East, the per capita income of most Palestinians is the same or lower than it was when we signed the agreement on the White House Lawn, because there are so many different groups that can paralyze the process with acts of terror or violence that close the borders, that stop everything, that wreck the economy, and that kind of burn the bridges of trust that get built up when things are going okay for a year or so. I think it is more like an abscessed tooth. So that is why I decided to make the speech I gave at the Israel Policy Forum. But they do not have to do that.

But I think any Israeli leader would have to see that, and I think in the end, any American government will come back to a concern for it, if for no other reason than a desire to have stability in the region. Let me turn you quickly to the economy. The Republicans are talking about a retroactive tax cut. You have got an economic statement tomorrow. Are the factors there, is the evidence there strong enough that there is a downturn going on and we need this retroactive tax cut? Well, first of all, the blue chip forecast, I think, is for 2.6 percent growth, which is enough growth to keep the unemployment rate at about 4 percent. And that really does not surprise me. When I saw the initial estimates, which were about 3.4 percent, I thought they were a tad high because we have been growing for a couple of years at nearly 5 percent, which is, for an advanced economy of our size, it is just virtually unprecedented. You simply could not sustain it at that rate. On the other hand, there is been a fairly sharp drop in stock values, and that takes a lot of wealth out of the economy, and eventually, that backs down into lower consumption and orders and things like that. So you see, for example, real problems in the steel industry today at a time when steel imports are also dropping. So it is not like the '97 crisis where-the crisis in Asia and Russia led people to try to flood the market in America with bargain basement prices. Here, you have got an overall problem. So I think I have always believed that a tax cut should be part of the next budget. I thought it should have been part of the last budget. It can be a little bigger than the one that I proposed, because the surplus has been written up some-the estimated surplus. Although I think it is very important that they go back and subtract from the estimated surplus the 10-year costs of the budget we just adopted, because it is the best education budget, for example, that we have had in my 8 years.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevehollandanddebbiecharlesreuters", "title": "William J.

{"id": 2137, "text": "But you have to prorate that out, and President-elect Bush has said he is very interested in continuing to support education, even though he wants to kind of rearrange the deck chairs on how we allocated it- which is, you know, that is up to him and the Congress. They will have to work that out. So I think the question is not so much whether one is warranted but what kind of tax cut should it be, and how big should it be? My concern-what I have believed in-I said this back during the campaign period so I can reiterate it-my view is that it should not be so large as to preclude our continued ability to pay down the debt and to stay more or less on the track we are on to get the debt down over the next 10 years, because if the markets perceive that we are going back into deficits, that would lead to an increase in interest rates, which would wipe out the impact of a tax cut for most Americans-even wealthy Americans, because it could have a depressing impact on the market, and it certainly would increase the cost of business borrowing and tend to slow down the growth of the economy. So the trick is-that also, by the way, would foreclose-this is what happened to me when I got in. I did not have the option to do what Americans would normally-the Government would normally do in a recession, which is to have a substantial tax cut and pump the thing back up, because the deficit was so big, it would just have caused interest rates to skyrocket. So the trick for the incoming administration- they have lots of options here. They can spend money; they can cut taxes; they can do more of one or less of the other-and less of the other. But the real-what I would be thinking about if I were in that position is, what is the aggregate amount we are going to commit here, particularly on the tax cut side, because it is not like-you do not have to repeat spending in years 2, 3, and 4. You can cut spending if times are tough. We have proved that. But once the tax money-once you cut the taxes, that is normally gone. It is hard to raise taxes when times are tough.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevehollandanddebbiecharlesreuters", "title": "William J.

{"id": 2138, "text": "So what I hope is, I think they ought to have a tax cut of some magnitude, but I think they ought to save back enough to keep on the track of paying down the debt, which also gives you the protection down the road. Someday, surely, the expansion will come to an end, but I do not think it has to come any time soon. And when it does, the more we pay the debt down, the more free we will be then to have a substantial tax cut to help the country in a recession-when that happens sometime in the future-without having an adverse impact on interest rates. So I do not think there is any question that they can have a tax cut. But I just think you do not want it so big that it takes you off the path of getting us out of debt, because the mental knowledge that that is the path we are on keeps interest rates low. The average American family now is saving $2,000 a year on a home mortgage, as compared to where we were back in '93. Long-term interest rates are 2 percent lower than when I took office, even though we have had an 8-year expansion, which is unheard of. You normally would not have that. And paying down the debt has a huge impact on that, because it frees up more and more money every year to borrow in the private sector, and interest rates are lower than they would be if the Government were competing. And let me also say there is something else that we should keep in mind. The more you pay down the debt, the lower your interest bill is. I think this year we have got interest payments on the debt down under 12 cents on the dollar. But they were at 13 or something, headed north, when I took office. Let us say we went-I am making this up, of course-let us say we went 4 or 5 more years on the same tack, and we got interest on the debt down to 6 cents on the dollar. That is a huge amount of money that is freed up every year for either investment in our future or for tax cuts. And you have more and more and more flexibility. Anyway, that is kind of a long-winded answer, but it is a very, very important subject, and I have thought about it a lot.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevehollandanddebbiecharlesreuters", "title": "William J.

And is it just going to create more problems with China, Russia in the future? Well, I think I made the right decision not to deploy. And I think that I made the right decision to continue the research program. And I hope that is what they will do. It is not clear to me exactly how they are going to operationalize their commitment. That is, because in the campaign, the President-elect said that he would do this if it could be developed, whether anybody else liked it or not, which bothered some people. But he also-the it that he was trying to develop was a system that was, in effect, more comprehensive than the more limited one that could have been deployed in the timeframes we were talking about during my tenure. So it may be that what he will decide to do is to intensify research. Look, if we actually knew we had the technology to take missiles out of the sky, even assuming that we get this agreement with North Korea-which I think we will get, on freezing the missile production, not selling missiles. That is teed up, and I believe the Bush administration will see it as a great opportunity. And I think it will be one seized within the first few months of the incoming administration. I think it will be one of their first achievements, because it is set, and I think it will happen. But even if that happens, with the proliferation of technology around the world, we cannot possibly know who might have missiles in the future. So I think we are almost morally obligated to continue to try to develop this kind of system. However, if we deploy the system in a way that leads to more proliferation and more insecurity, that is very problematic. And it is one of the things that I had to consider, that if we just set it up, even if we were worried about North Korea and the Middle East, if the Chinese interpreted it as a move to try to contain them, even though there is no way we could- even if they have just 50 missiles, that is more than-or two dozen, whatever they have got-two dozen I guess, more or less-they might decide that now they need 300.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevehollandanddebbiecharlesreuters", "title": "William J.

And by the way, I expect that there will be a further reduction in nuclear warheads by both countries. That is one thing I think the Bush administration will be in a position to do, because of the development of our relationships, I will be-I expect that President Putin and then-President Bush will be successful in continuing to reduce the nuclear arsenals. But you do not want to have all this sort of uncontrolled instability in some other part of the world. But there is a way to continue to work the missile defense issue, and then there would be a way to put it at the service of all countries, the technology, which is what President Reagan used to talk about when he was talking about the Star Wars in the sky and all of that. Philosophically, he had an idea of making it available to all countries so that no one would be any more at risk, including from us. We are talking about technology to stop the accidental launch or a terrorist or a country with two or three missiles that could lob them at you. Two or three missiles could do a world of damage on the United States or someone else. So I just think-I think that I left it with a maximum number of options for the next administration.

{"id": 2142, "text": "In a speech the other day, you spoke quite a lot about the consequences of Congress rejecting this deal. But let us talk about the other side of that, what the world looks like if the deal is approved. Secretary of State Kerry said to us the other day that this nuclear deal will leave the United States absolutely - his word - absolutely freer to push back against Iran and its ambitions in the region. If you get the deal, what do you intend to do with that freedom? Well, let us first focus on the fact that a central objective of not just my foreign policy but of U.S. foreign policy with Democratic or Republican administrations has been preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And this deal achieves that. It cuts off all the pathways for Iran getting a nuclear weapon. In exchange, Iran gets relief from the sanctions that we organized, systematically, with the international community over the last several years that is crippled their economy and forced them back to the table. With that issue resolved, although we will have to be vigilant through the inspection process and the verification process, although we will have a backstop in being able to exercise all options, including military, if Iran violated or cheated on the agreement, then an additional priority that we have is making sure that Iran ends some of the destabilizing activities that it is engaged in for a very long time, providing arms to Hezbollah to threaten Israel and our other allies in the region, making sure that through proxies, Iran is not engaging in destabilizing activities toward Gulf countries. And to both Israel and our Gulf partners and allies in the region, what we have said to them is that we can handle those issues if we are more consistent, better organized in the things that are required to deal with those non-nuclear threats, those more conventional or low-grade threats. For example, dealing with cyberattacks, there are ways we can deal with those issues more effectively than we have. Making sure that there are special forces and other ground operations that can be carried out to support stabilizing efforts in places like Yemen. So there are a whole host of areas where we can work together, and we are in fact in the process of consulting with those countries as we speak. Should we expect the United States to push more forcefully against Iran and its support for groups like Hezbollah, for example?

For example, to interdict arms shipments to Hezbollah by Iran, the problem is not that we do not have the authority to do it. The problem is not that we and Israelis want to stop that from happening, or Gulf allies want to stop that from happening. We have to have better intelligence. We have to have better interdiction capabilities. And so, you know, the issue here is not how much we spend or how hard we try; the issue is are we doing it the right way? Are we being smart about it? I have said, for example, that the Gulf countries, their combined defense spending is eight times Iran's. So the issue is not even if Iran is putting in additional dollars as a consequence of sanctions relief and an improved economy, Iran will continue to be outspent. It is that under any scenario our problems are greatly magnified if in fact Iran also has a nuclear weapon. And, you know, this is a situation of first things first, this deal accomplishes that, and it is as a consequence, worthy of support. This is what I am driving at, though. As you know very well, ENTITY, your critics have argued that this deal, even whatever it does to the nuclear program, leaves Iran free to act in the region in ways the United States may well oppose. Yeah, but - but - but - but ENTITY, that is not accurate because the notion that somehow Iran is untethered ignores the fact that, for example, we will still have our sanctions in place with respect to non-nuclear activities like sponsorship of terrorism or violation of human rights. There is no logic to the notion that somehow we will let up on trying to prevent activities that Iran may engage in that would be contrary to our national security interests. So show me the alternative vision from what the critics have laid out, then. Do you foresee a world in which 10 or 15 years from now, when the provisions of this agreement begin to expire, some of them, that there is an opportunity by then to completely or substantially reshape the region or the security situation in the region?

Having said that, it is possible that as a consequence of this engagement, that as a consequence of Iran being able to recognize that what is happening in Syria for example is leading to extremism that threatens their own state and not just the United States; that some convergence of interests begins to lead to conversations between, for example, Saudi Arabia and Iran; that Iran starts making different decisions that are less offensive to its neighbors; that it tones down the rhetoric in terms of its virulent opposition to Israel. And, you know, that is something that we should welcome. There is the possibility that if you look at what is going on in the Middle East right now, more and more states begin to recognize that their enemy is chaos and ISIL and disaffected young people, Shia and Sunni, who are attracted to, you know, ideologies that are in opposition to every regime there. And - and that is something that I think that we should be willing to help promote if in fact they can get there. But again, that is not something that is guaranteed or even necessary for us to want to get this deal done so that Iran's not getting a nuclear weapon. Let me ask about two ways that, according to critics, this agreement might make the region less stable. As you know very well, Iran's neighbors, many of them U.S. allies, have been skeptical of this deal, and the U.S., to reassure them, has among other things promised them more weapons. Will not more weapons in the hands of countries that may be allies, but also have their own agendas, create the possibility of more instability over time? Well first - first of all, the - our defense support of these countries is not automatically premised on more weapons. It is premised on them being more effective with their defense budgets. So, just to give you an example, the Gulf countries, if they were coordinating their missile defense systems, would be more effective than each of them, in a siloed fashion, operating their own missile defense systems. They do not have to spend more money to get that done; they just have to do a better job integrating what they are doing.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio0", "title": "Interview With Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-0", "publication_date": "10-08-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I think what is much more likely is if we reject this deal and Iran's pursuing breakout times that are shrinking because they are installing more and more advanced centrifuges and stockpiling more and more highly enriched uranium is that some of those neighbors who feel threatened by Iran start thinking maybe they should be pursuing their own nuclear program. And that is exactly the kinds of scenarios that we need to prevent. In those scenarios, we will then be confronted, either me or the next president, or the president after that, would be confronted with a pretty stark decision. If we do not want to see a nuclear arms race, if we are seeing Iran getting closer and closer to breakout capacity, and we have before the entire world rejected what every serious nuclear expert who looks at this says is a serious deal to constrain their nuclear program, then in fact that leaves one option, and that is some form of military strike. That may be the preference of some who are on the other side of this debate. But I think the one thing that we should have learned from over a decade now of war in the Middle East is, is that, you know, even limited military actions end up carrying with them great costs and unintended consequences. I am glad you mentioned breakout times, ENTITY. And we should define that for people. That is the length of time Iran would need to go for a bomb ... if they decided to go for a bomb. Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel has argued that as the agreement begins to expire, 13, 14, 15 years from now, the breakout time goes back down to near zero. And in saying that, he quotes you in an interview with us, in which you made a statement that was later clarified. 15 years from now, as some provisions expire, what is Iran's breakout time going to be?

If in fact the breakout times now are a few months, and we are able to push that breakout time out to a year so that we have more time and space to see whether or not Iran is cheating on an agreement, kicking out inspectors, going for a nuclear weapon; if the breakout time is extended for 15 years and then it goes back to where it is right now, why is that a bad deal? Why are we better off with a breakout time entirely shrunk in six months or nine months, where we have no inspectors on the ground, we have less insight into their program, we have shattered international unity, because the perception now is that the United States, having painstakingly arrived at an agreement and mobilized the entire world community behind it, has seen its Congress rejected? In what sense are we better off in that scenario than we would be having set up a situation where 15 years from now, that breakout time is approximately where it is now, but we now have an entire infrastructure that is been built to keep track of exactly what Iran's doing, and we had the entire international community behind us?

Seems likely a majority of Congress will vote against it. Are you entirely comfortable going forward with a historic deal knowing that most of the people's representatives are against it? Well, what I know is, is that, unfortunately, a large portion of the Republican Party, if not a near unanimous portion of Republican representatives, are going to be opposed to anything that I do, and I have not oftentimes based that on a judgment on the merits, but have based that on their politics . That is true in health care, that is true in, you know, budget negotiations. That is been true on a whole host of things. And I do not think that is a surprise to anybody. What I do know, though, is, is that when this agreement is implemented and we have seen centrifuges coming out of facilities like Fordow and Natanz, and we have got inspectors on the ground and it becomes clear that Iran in fact is abiding by this agreement, then attitudes will change, because people will recognize that, in fact, whatever parade of horribles was presented in opposition have not come true. That, instead, what we have seen is an effective way to bind Iran to a commitment not to have nuclear weapons and, in that scenario, it'll probably be forgotten that Republicans uniformly opposed it. Keep in mind that this is not unique to me, either, by the way. You know, when Ronald Reagan began discussions with Gorbachev, his conservative supporters wrote some really rough stuff about him as appeasing the evil empire, and this is a disaster, and we are giving America's power away. And, to his credit, he had reversed himself from a - a previously much more rigid position that had helped to define his political career. So - so my main interest right now is solving a problem, which is making sure Iran does not get a nuclear weapon, and I am confident that, as we see implementation, we will see, in fact, more and more folks pull out of the immediate politics of it and judge it on the basis of whether it was the right thing to do for the country.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio0", "title": "Interview With Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-0", "publication_date": "10-08-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I think that there are real problems with how we are electing our representatives. I think political gerrymandering has resulted in a situation in which - with 80 percent Democratic districts or 80 percent Republican districts and no competition, that that leads to more and more polarization in Congress, and it gets harder and harder to get things done. I think that the Senate filibuster process and the 60-vote requirement to break a filibuster is making it harder and harder to govern at a time where there is polarization. I think the influence of superPACs and the ability of a handful of billionaires to dictate who can compete or not compete, for example, in a Republican primary, with the debate coming up - you know, that is a problem. So I think there are a whole range of systems problems that we have to resolve, but, you know, having said all that, I tend to be still pretty optimistic about the future of the American political process and our democracy.

And, in part because of some of those changes in practices, we saw, last year, for the first time in 40 years, a drop in both the number of people incarcerated and the crime rate. I think what we have seen is the possibility, now, of having a - a broader public conversation, and this is one area where I have been pleasantly surprised to see some bipartisan interest.

Keep in mind that all these issues are ones that we have been working on for some time. It took about a year to arrive at the Cuba policy that was announced yesterday, including extensive negotiations with the Cuban government, meetings with the Vatican, making sure that we had looked at all the policy ramifications. And I was persuaded that ultimately this would be good for the Cuban people and more likely to lead to a loosening up of the restrictions or oppression that exists there. With respect to immigration reform, obviously I'd been working on that for six years. But this was the moment when you could do those things? Well, I do - here is what I do think is true - that, um, I have spent six years now in this office. We have dealt with the worst economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression. We have dealt with international turmoil that we have not seen in - in a lot of years. And I said at the beginning of this year that 2014 would be a breakthrough year - and it was a bumpy path. But at the end of 2014, I could look back and say we are as well-positioned today as we have been in quite some time economically; that American leadership is more needed around the world than ever before - and that is liberating in the sense that a lot of the work that we have done is now beginning to bear fruit. And it gives me an opportunity then to start focusing on some of the other hard challenges that I did not always have the time or the capacity to get to earlier in my - earlier in my presidency. Can I think of you as shifting from things you had to do to things you more want to do? Think about how much energy was required for us to yank ourselves out of the economic circumstances we were in when I came into office. That was a big lift and it took up a lot of time.

On education, we really wanted to dig in and make sure that we started reforming a system that was not serving our kids well for the competitive 21st century environment. So, these were all big structural shifts that we had to do. I could - I put immigration on that list and was frustrated that we were not able to get legislation. And - and so, the executive action was, in some ways, just a first step in what I hope will be a continuing effort going forward. But it - what is true is that I am in a position now where, with the economy relatively strong, with us having lowered the deficit, with us having strong growth and job growth, for the first time us starting to see wages ticking up, with inflation low, with energy production high - now I have the ability to focus on some long-term projects, including making sure that everybody is benefiting from this growth and not just some. And on the international front, you know, even as we are managing ISIL and trying to roll them back and ultimately defeat them, even as we have been executing the draw down in Afghanistan in a responsible way, the moves like the Cuba diplomatic initiative are ones that I want to make sure I continue to pursue partly because, frankly, a - it is easier for ENTITY to do at the end of his term than a new president coming in.

Well, let me figure out if there is overlap on immigration. In an interview in August, you described the Republican Party as being captive to nativist elements of the party.

I - I think the Republican Party contains a lot of legislators who recognize that; and we know that because those folks voted for a comprehensive bill in the Senate that in many ways was more generous than I was able to offer through executive action. So - so, the question then becomes, by me having taken these actions, does that spur those voices in the Republican Party who I think genuinely believe immigration is good for our country? Does it spur them to work once again with Democrats and my administration to get a reasonable piece of legislation done? Or does it simply solidify what I do think is - is a nativist trend in parts of the Republican Party? And - and if it is the latter, then probably we are not going to get much more progress done and it'll be a major debate in the next presidential election. I think that if a Republican lawmaker was sitting here, he might say, Wait a minute. I am not captive to nativist elements. I have actual concerns and you are not addressing them. Well, the problem is what are those concerns and - and how is it that I am not addressing them? If - if the concern is border security, we have got more resources, more border police, more money being spent at our borders than any time in the last 30, 40 years. If the concern is the flow of illegal workers into the country, that flow is about half of what it was and is lower than any time since the 1970s.

How do you lead the country when people see the basic facts so profoundly differently? Not new, but how do you deal with it in your final...

If you'd asked whites in those jurisdictions do you think traffic stops were done fairly, the majority of whites probably would say yes because it is not something they experi-ence. It is not because of racism; it is just that it is not something that they see. We were able to work with the police departments and the state police in Illinois and persuade them that they would be doing a better job policing if we just kept track so that we had data. And combined with training, suddenly those officers out there are more intentional about how they decide should I stop somebody or not. And the incidents of racial profiling went down. The same is true with a lot of these issues. If you have good policing - I guarantee you that nobody's interested more in good policing than African American community or Latino community because they are more likely to be victimized, if they are in low income communities, by crime.

We are fighting for you. And one of the best examples of this is the Affordable Care Act, which - if you were just looking at the way it is been couched and characterized by the Republican Party, and in some cases by the news, the perception is somehow that this is largely something that is benefiting black and Hispanic and downscale voters. Well, the truth of the matter is that a state like Kentucky that does not have a massive black or Hispanic population has been one of the strongest states - Mitch McConnell's state's one of the best states in using the Affordable Care Act to insure huge numbers of working class white voters. It is just they do not call it Obamacare; they call it something else. And - and so, there is sometimes a gap in perceptions that we have to bridge. I think there is a legitimate sense of loss, particularly among men, who have seen manufacturing diminish; construction has been in the tank. The jobs that are out there are not ones that are traditionally jobs that, you know, blue collar men aspire to. And, you know, we have got to speak to those concerns.

Tehran is a large, sophisticated country that has a track record of state-sponsored ter-rorism, that we know was attempting to develop a nuclear weapon, or at least the component parts that would be required to develop a nuclear weapon; that has engaged in disruptions to our allies; whose rhetoric is not only explicitly anti-American but also has been incendiary when it comes to its attitude towards the state of Israel.

But in order for us to I think open that aperture with respect to Iran, we have to get this nuclear issue resolved - and there is a chance to do it and the question's going to be whether or not Iran is willing to seize it. I think there are elements inside of Iran that recognize the opportunity and want to take it; I think there is some hardliners inside of Iran that are threatened by a resolution of this because they are so invested politically and emotionally in being anti-American or anti-Western that - that it is frightening for them to - to open themselves up to the world in this way. That raises a word that I want to bring up that former Secretary of State Clinton used in a speech the other day. She was criticized for talking about empathy - having empathy or understanding for even enemies around the world. There are, though, military people who use empathy for the enemy, by which they mean not sympathy but understanding the enemy so you can... Do you feel that you have sufficient empathy for the Iranians, meaning do you feel you understand what it is they need to get a deal done and is it possible? I think we do because if you - if you look at the negotiations as they have proceeded, what we have said to the Iranians is that we are willing to recognize your ability to develop a modest nuclear power program for your energy needs - that there is a way of doing that that nevertheless gives the world assurances that you do not have breakout capacity.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio1", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-1", "publication_date": "18-12-2014", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

They have legitimate defense concerns - but those have to be separated out from the adventurism, the support of organizations like Hezbollah, the threats they have directed towards Israel. And - and so, on the one hand, you need to understand what their legitimate needs and concerns are. On the other end, you do not need to tolerate or make excuses for positions that they have taken that violate international law, are contrary to U.S. interests, are contrary to the interests of our allies. They have got a chance to get right with the world. This is not just about us. I mean, there is a reason why we have been able to get this far in the negotiations. We mobilized the international community at the start of my presidency - a classic example of American leadership. The sanctions worked because we did not just get our usual allies' support of this; we got China in support of it; we have Russia that still is supportive of the position that the P5+1 has taken in negotiations. So, when I came into office, the world was divided and Iran was in the driver's seat. Now the world's united because of the actions we have taken and Iran's the one that is isolated. They have a path to break through that isolation and they should seize it. Because if they do, there is incredible talent and resources and sophistication inside of - inside of Iran and it would be a very successful regional power that was also abiding by international norms and international rules - and that would be good for everybody. That would be good for the United States, that would be good for the region, and most of all, it would be good for the Iranian people. One other question, ENTITY - in a speech in September, you spoke of the United States' legacy of freedom, is the phrase that you used. You spoke of preserving that and wanting to extend it. I want to ask about efforts to extend the idea of freedom or democracy around the world, particularly in the Middle East. You disagreed with invading Iraq partly to de-mocratize that country. You had your own efforts - and Egypt has not turned out very well... It came full circle and it is back under military rule.

I think it is important to distinguish between the actions that we take to promote democracy and human rights and rule of law and good governance and the humility to understand that, in the end, these things are going to happen because the people in these countries demand them. Let me just move out of the Middle East momentarily and then we will swing back. This is one of the most isolated countries for the last 40 years, ruled by a brutal, repressive military junta. We seized that opportunity. We engaged with Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Prize winner, but we also engaged with President Sein, who saw that Burma was traveling down a dead end. They had parliamentary elections for the first time. They are now preparing to amend their constitution and schedule broader parliamentary elections. And there are all kinds of troubles in Burma; the experiment may go haywire. They may not be able to reconcile all the different ethnic groups inside the country; the military ultimately may not be willing to give up its prerogatives and its power. Now, we want to be on the side of those who can take advantage of that opportunity. I feel very confident, very good about the work we are doing there. But I cannot guarantee success because ultimately it is going to be up to the Burmese people and Burmese leaders to seize this moment. The Middle East, I think, is - is similar, but in some ways even more difficult. Because you have this counter-narrative in the Middle East in which a sizable portion of Islamic extremists have been able to penetrate the imaginations of young people there; you have govern - governments that oftentimes are creaky, do not serve their people, are repressive; you do not have a civic tradition there. And so, you have to almost start from scratch in many of these countries. What we can do is to be opportunistic and find places where somebody's ready and willing to move forward and do everything we can to help - and Tunisia's a great example of that. Not perfect - still dangerous, still troublesome; but you have seen a civil society develop, elections take place, a constitution get drafted, Islamists being willing to be involved in the political process without trying to take it over completely and accommodations to the fact that economic and social reforms are required for that country to succeed.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio1", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-1", "publication_date": "18-12-2014", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Which raises a question - is there a responsibility by the United States to do more in Libya, having been involved in... I - I think that the challenge that we are going to have is a recognition that we are hugely influential; we are the one indispensable nation. But when it comes to nation-building, when it comes to what is going to be a generational project in a place like Libya or a place like Syria or a place like Iraq, we can help, but we cannot do it for them. Now, I think the American people recognize that. There are times here in Washington where pundits do not ; they think you can just move chess pieces around the table. And whenever we have that kind of hubris, we tend to get burned. Where we are successful is where we see an opportunity, we put resources in, we support those who are trying to do the right thing for their society; and every so often, something breaks. But - but I think that one of the things I have learned over six years, and it does not always suit the news cycle, is having some strategic patience. You will recall that three or four months ago, everybody in Washington was convinced that President Putin was a genius... And he had outmaneuvered all of us and he had, you know, bullied and, you know, strategized his way into expanding Russian power. And I said at the time we do not want war with Russia but we can apply steady pressure working with our European partners, being the backbone of an international coalition to oppose Russia's violation of another country's sovereignty, and that over time, this would be a strategic mistake by Russia. And today, you know, I'd - I'd sense that at least outside of Russia, maybe some people are thinking what Putin did was not so smart. Are you just lucky that the price of oil went down and therefore their cur-rency collapsed or... Is it something that you did?

I - I say that, not to suggest that we have solved Ukraine, but I am saying that to - to give an indication that when it comes to the international stage, these problems are big, they are difficult, they are messy. But wherever we have been involved over the last several years, I think the outcome has been better because of American leadership. Because of American leadership, not only have we not seen another Ebola case here in the United States - and when we do, we will be prepared for it - but internationally, resources, medics, testing, science has poured into poor countries. We are practically rebuilding their public health infrastructure because of our leadership. It does not happen in two weeks; it does not happen in - in four weeks. But if we are steady about it and we are focused and we are clear that we possess capacities as well as values that require us to engage, that we will be successful. Just to wrap this up with this idea that you began with, of doing things that you want to do rather than... Have to do, has your limited response to ISIS in Iraq and Syria been driven in part by a sense that this is a very dangerous threat, but not the biggest problem the United States faces in the world, and you do not want to be distracted from far bigger things going on elsewhere? I think we cannot underestimate the danger of ISIL. They are a terrorist network that, unlike Al Qaeda, has not limited itself to the periodic attack but have aspirations to control large swaths of territory, that possess resources and effectively an army that pose great dangers to our allies and can destabilize entire regions that are very dangerous for us. So, I - I do not want to downplay that threat. It is a real one; it is the reason why I have authorized, as part of a broader 60 nation coalition, an effort to fight back and to push them back and ultimately destroy them.

Our energy resources, both conventional and clean energy resources, put most other of our competitors to shame. Demographically, we have got a young population, in part because of immigration. We have got the best universities in the world; we have got the best workers in the world. Our manufacturing base has come roaring back, led by the auto industry, but not restricted by it. Our deficits I have cut by two-thirds. And so, if you look out towards the future, America is in a great position and our military is more capable than any military in history. We do not really have a serious peer, at least on the conventional level, although obviously Russia is a - is a significant nuclear power. The question then becomes, alright, how do we play those cards well? Part of it is at-tending to immediate problems like ISIL; part of it is making sure that we are firm in upholding international norms as we have been in Ukraine; part of it is managing short-term crises that could turn into long-term disasters if we are not attentive, like Ebola. But ultimately, the thing that is most dangerous for the United States is us not tending to the very sources of our strength. So, it is true that when it comes to ISIL, us devoting another trillion dollars after having been involved in big occupations of countries that did not turn out all that well - I am very hesitant to do that because we need to spend a trillion dollars rebuilding our schools, our roads, our basic science and research here in the United States; that is going to be a recipe for our long-term security and success. And what we have also learned is that if we do for others what they need to do for themselves - if we come in and send the Marines in to fight ISIL and the Iraqis have no skin in the game, then it is not going to last. When we look at an issue like Ukraine, we have to be firm with the Russians but we have also got to make sure that we have got our own fiscal house in order; we got to make sure that we are doing what we need to do to build our manufacturing base because ultimately, the big advantage we have with Russia is we have got a dynamic, vital economy, and they do not .

{"id": 2165, "text": "I have been reading a history of part of the Cold War. Dwight Eisenhower was president, he is meeting his Cabinet sometimes in this room where we are sitting. The Soviet Union has emerged as a major nuclear threat. The country is very worried at this point in the 1950s. But Eisenhower is convinced that they are not that strong, that the United States is stronger, that the U.S. will win if we just avoid a huge war. And he decides to try to reassure the public, gives a series of speeches, saying keep your chin up, everything's fine, our strategy is working. The public does not believe him. He is accused of a failure of leadership, and his approval rating goes down. Are you going through the same experience now with regard to ISIS? Well, I tell you, first of all, I was not the Supreme Allied Commander helping to defeat Hitler, so he had a little credibility that he was working with. ISIS is a virulent, nasty organization that has gained a foothold in ungoverned spaces effectively in Syria and parts of western Iraq. We have to take it seriously. They have shown in Paris what they can do in an organized fashion, and in San Bernardino what we have seen is their ability to proselytize for their perverted brand of Islam and spur small-scale terrorist attacks. We are pounding ISIL's core structure in Syria and Iraq. We have put together a coalition that is increasingly effective. We have seen ISIL lose about 40 percent of its populated territory in the region, and both in terms of homeland security and in terms of our efforts over there, I am confident that we are going to prevail. But it is also important for us to keep things in perspective, and this is not an organization that can destroy the United States. This is not a huge industrial power that can pose great risks to us institutionally or in a systematic way. But they can hurt us, and they can hurt our people and our families. The most damage they can do, though, is if they start changing how we live and what our values are, and part of my message over the next 14 months or 13 months that I remain in office is to just make sure that we remember who we are and make sure that our resilience, our values, our unity are maintained.

{"id": 2166, "text": "And I say that simply because, according to polls, you do not have very much approval for it. Well, I think what is fair is that post-Paris you had a saturation of news about the horrible attack there. And ISIL combines viciousness with very savvy media operations. And as a consequence, if you have been watching television for the last month, all you have been seeing, all you have been hearing about is these guys with masks or black flags who are potentially coming to get you. And so I understand why people are concerned about it, and this is a serious situation, but what is important is for people to recognize that the power, the strength of the United States and its allies are not threatened by an organization like this; in the same way that al-Qaida was able to carry out one spectacular attack we ended up making some significant changes to harden homeland defenses. It then took awhile for us to ultimately snuff out core al-Qaida in the FATA, and there are still lingering remnants, but at no point was there ever a sense that in fact it could do catastrophic damage to us. You referred to ISIL's sophisticated media operation and also referred to what Americans are seeing in the American media. Are you suggesting that the media are being played in a sense here? Look, the media is pursuing ratings. I think that, you know, it is up to the media to make a determination about how they want to cover things. There is no doubt that the actions of ISIL are designed to amplify their power and the threat that they pose. That helps them recruit, that adds in the twisted thoughts of some young person that they might want to have carry out an action, that somehow they are part of a larger movement. And so I think that the American people absorb that, understandably are of concern. Now on our side, I think that there is a legitimate criticism of what I have been doing and our administration has been doing in the sense that we have not , you know, on a regular basis I think described all the work that we have been doing for more than a year now to defeat ISIL.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio2", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-2", "publication_date": "21-12-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And so part of our goal here is to make sure that people are informed about all the actions that we are taking. But one of the interesting things that you have seen evolve over the last several weeks, including in the debates that are taking place between the Republican candidates, is that those who are critics of our administration response, or the military, the intelligence response that we are currently mounting, when you ask them, well, what would you do instead, they do not have an answer. And the reason they do not have an answer is because the truth is that the approach that we are taking is one that is based on the best counsel and best advice of our top military, top intelligence, top diplomatic teams. And we are going after ISIL effectively. We are going after them hard. Your critics have said they want to use more force. You have sometimes responded by suggesting that people who want to use more force want another Iraq War and that that is not practical. Well, when you listen to them, though, and you ask, well, what exactly are you talking about? Well, we are going to bomb more. Where is it that you are going to bomb? When you talk about something like carpet-bombing, what do you mean? We carry out precision strikes based on intelligence of where ISIL is, where their infrastructure is, where their oil tankers are. And if the suggestion is is that we kill tens or hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians and Iraqis, that is not who we are and that would be a strategy that would have enormous backlash against the United States. It would be terrible for our national security. And, you know, unfortunately many of these critics can get away with just suggesting that bombing more, or being less discriminant in how we approach that, would make a difference. Let me put it this way.

And the key is to make sure that we have got sound intelligence. And I make no apologies for us wanting to do this appropriately and in a way that is consistent with American values. Are you avoiding more force because you are concerned that even a little more force might call for the demand for even more force, and you would end up with a large war? What is interesting is that most of the critics have not called for ground forces. To his credit, I think Lindsey Graham is one of the few who has been at least honest about suggesting here is something I would do that ENTITY is not doing. He does not just talk about being louder or sounding tougher in the process. But as I explained, and I have tested this repeatedly with our military intelligence folks, when you start looking at an Iraq-type deployment of large numbers of troops - 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 troops - we are now in a situation in which we are committing ourselves not only to going door to door in places like Mosul and Raqqa, which I am confident that we could do, but we have essentially said to the Iraqis and the Syrians that we are going to govern for you. And that ends up being of an indefinite period. So part of what we have to do for a sustained defeat of ISIL is to help local forces develop capacity, do it the right way, do it for themselves with our assistance and our help, so that we can actually create a stable government structure in this region. Now that sometimes requires more patience than simply deploying a bunch of Marines. Our fighting forces are the best in the world, but in order to defeat an enemy like this, what we have to do is have a situation in which people can govern. You have acknowledged this requires patience. In October, before San Bernardino, a Justice Department official stated that he believed that domestic terrorists were a greater threat to the United States than international groups like al-Qaida or ISIS. Do you believe that still now, after San Bernardino and Paris? I do not know the exact citation that you are referring to.

The Fort Hood attack was inspired by Anwar Awlaki, who was with AQAP, al-Qaida in the Peninsula or in Yemen, and we have seen periodically self-radicalization through the Internet or jihadist propaganda. But ISIL is more systematic and more effective in their media, in their online presence, and that raises additional concerns. So part of what we have to do in response is to ramp up countering that narrative online, working with local communities to make sure that we are inoculating ourselves and our young people from this kind of recruitment. It is a more complicated problem because of the fact that a couple like the San Bernardino couple, you do not see in a way that you would see an organization that is planning a complex plot like 9/11. So in that sense we have some new dangers, some new concerns that we have to deal with. It is something that we have known could happen for quite some time, and it is something that, as I said over at the National Counterterrorism Center today when I visited, it is something that we have got some incredibly effective intelligence folks working on every single day. Leading candidates in both parties have suggested in one way or another that they want to be more active against this threat. You have argued for the approach that you are taking and that too much action would be unwise. What advice would you give whoever you are going to turn this room over to in a year or so? Again, I would just repeat, ENTITY, that when you really sort through all the rhetoric, the notion more active or a stronger response ... Hillary Clinton spoke about no-fly zones. There are basically two things that I have heard people say. You bomb ISIL. You are not trying to bomb innocent people. And that requires intelligence and confidence in our military to be able to develop the kinds of targets that we need.

{"id": 2170, "text": "The other new thing that people have suggested would be some variation of the no-fly zone or a safe zone. This is something we have been talking about for three or four years. The challenge there is that ISIL does not have an air force, so the damage done there is not against ISIL, it is against the Syrian regime. And what is absolutely true is that we need to make sure that we bring about an end to the civil war in Syria, and John Kerry, through the work he is been doing in Vienna negotiations and this week in New York, is seeing some progress in bringing Russians and Iranians together but creating a safe zone for Syrian refugees. We have tested, we have looked at repeatedly, the problem is that, again, without a large number of troops on the ground, it is hard to create a safe zone like that. And that does not solve the ISIL problem. My point is, ENTITY, that I think my main advice to my successor - now hopefully by the time I turn over the keys, we have made the kind of progress that I am expecting and will have pushed for over the course of the next 13 months ... Do you think there will be a united front against ISIS by then? I think we will have made significant progress in degrading ISIL by then. The diplomacy I think is critically important because to the extent that we can get the Syrian regime, Iran, Russia to recognize what we believe is the core threat, which is ISIL, and the disintegration of social order in Sunni-controlled areas in Iraq and Syria, the more effective and faster we can go. But what I would say to my successor is that it is important not just to shoot but to aim, and it is important in this seat to make sure that you are making your best judgments based on data, intelligence, the information that is coming from your commanders and folks on the ground, and you are not being swayed by politics. Whoever takes over this office after you might be a Democrat, might be a Republican, there may be a Republican Congress again.

{"id": 2171, "text": "Well, first of all I am confident that a Democrat will win the White House, and I think when you look at the quality of our Democratic candidates and what the Republican Party seems to be offering up, I think we will do well. Second of all, I think we have got a good chance of winning back the Senate, and the truth of the matter is is that where Democrats have had problems is we had the misfortune of doing poorly in 2010 when there was redistricting, and in many of the successive elections Democrats have actually voted at higher rates. This was true in 2012, for example. There were more Democratic ballots cast for Democratic candidates than there were Republicans, but because of where Democrats live and where Republicans live, and because of the nature of the Senate, we ended up having problems. So one of the things that I will be arguing over the course of the next year is to make sure that Democrats run an issue-based campaign on the things that we believe in and care about, and I think we have got a great track record of real progress on a whole range of fronts. If we make those arguments clearly and forthrightly and are not defensive, then I am actually confident we will do just fine. Have you insulated the climate deal, for example, which is so important to your legacy, from being undone by future presidents, given that many of the commitments you made in Paris are not legally binding? Well, keep in mind that the Republican Party in the United States is perhaps literally the only major party in the developed world that is still engaging in climate denial. Even far-right parties in other places acknowledge that the science shows that temperatures are going up and that that is a really dangerous thing we have got to do something about. And the deal that we struck in Paris was an example of American leadership at its best. We were able to mobilize 200 countries to make serious commitments that are transparent, where every country is going to be held accountable, where everybody chips in, and it does not solve the entire problem, but it puts the world on track to deal with a problem that could be monumental in its effect if we do not do something about it.

I think that the signal that we are sending to the private sector, that will in turn invest heavily in solar and wind and battery technologies, the doubling of fuel efficiency standards on cars, all these things start taking on a momentum of their own. And we have seen this since I came into office. Since my inauguration, the amount of wind power has tripled, the amount of solar power has gone up by 20 times. We have seen the costs of clean energy go down much faster than any of us anticipated. So they cannot stop you? And when we decide - what it means is that by the time that even a Republican president came into office, what you would have seen would be a growing realization that not only should we do something about climate change, but it is not only a challenge, it is also an opportunity, that it is creating jobs, that it is making a difference in people's lives, that consumers are saving money. When I doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars, that puts money in people's pockets. When you retrofit a building so that it is got better temperature control and you cut your light bill by 20 percent, 30 percent, you know what? In fact, when it comes to solar power, you have got this weird coalition between environmentalists and Tea Party-ers in some Western states because the traditional dirty fuel industry is trying to prevent greater utilization of solar power. So a lot of these things get institutionalized not just through government policy but through the impact that it has on the marketplace and the private sector. ENTITY, we are nearing the end of a year where the question of national identity, who we are, has been a part of one large event after another. I made a list here, in fact. All of them in some sense touch on that question of who we are.

But I do think that when you combine that demographic change with all the economic stresses that people have been going through because of the financial crisis, because of technology, because of globalization, the fact that wages and incomes have been flatlining for some time, and that particularly blue-collar men have had a lot of trouble in this new economy, where they are no longer getting the same bargain that they got when they were going to a factory and able to support their families on a single paycheck you combine those things and it means that there is going to be potential anger, frustration, fear. Some of it justified but just misdirected. I think somebody like Mr. Trump is taking advantage of that. That is what he is exploiting during the course of his campaign.

There is no black family that has not had a conversation around the kitchen table about driving while black and being profiled or being stopped. I think really what is changed over the last several years is the pervasiveness of smartphones and the visuals that suddenly have sparked a conversation about how we can deal with it.

You know, during that process there is going to be some noise and some discomfort, but I am absolutely confident that over the long term, it leads to a fair, more just, healthier America. Let me follow up on a couple of things you mentioned. You mentioned slavery. Among the many protests this year are two small but symbolically interesting ones at Ivy League universities. At your alma mater, Harvard Law, there is a seal for the school that is based on the family crest of a slave owner. At Yale there is a school named after John C. Calhoun, who was a great defender of slavery. The call is to get rid of those symbols. You know, as ENTITY of the United States I probably do not need to wade into every specific controversy at a ... But you can do it. But here is what I will say generally. I think it is a healthy thing for young people to be engaged and to question authority and to ask why this instead of that, to ask tough questions about social justice. So I do not want to discourage kids from doing that. As I have said before, I do think that there have been times on college campuses where I get concerned that the unwillingness to hear other points of view can be as unhealthy on the left as on the right, and that, you know ... Meaning listen to people that you might initially think are bigoted or ... Yes, there have been times where you start seeing on college campuses students protesting somebody like the director of the IMF or Condi Rice speaking on a campus because they do not like what they stand for. If somebody does not believe in affirmative action, they may disagree - you may disagree with them. I disagree with them, but have an argument with them. It is possible for somebody not to be racist and want a just society but believe that that is something that is inconsistent with the Constitution.

If what you are suggesting is is that, you know, somebody questioning whether I was born in the United States or not, how do I think about that, I would say that that is something that is actively promoted and may gain traction because of my unique demographic. But maybe you have got something else in mind. Years ago you made that remark, you were much criticized for saying something about people clinging to guns and religion. And although you were criticized for the phrasing of that, it seemed to me that you were attempting to figure out, what is it that people are thinking, what is it that is bothering people? Now you have had several more years to think about that. Well, keep in mind, ENTITY, I was elected twice by decent majorities.

But that is not to suggest that everybody who objects to my policies may not have perfectly good reasons for it. If you are living in a town that historically has relied on coal and you see coal jobs diminishing, you probably are going to be more susceptible to the argument that I have been wiping out the economy in your area.

If somebody tells you that this is because of ENTITY's war on coal, well, you know, that is an argument you may be sympathetic to. So as I said, you asked a pretty open-ended question. I think you were being a little coy in how you asked it. I am trying to give you room to answer. No, I understand, but what I am saying is that I think that there is always going to be, every president, a certain cohort that just does not like your policies, does not like your party, what have you.

{"id": 2177, "text": "Thanks for joining us one more time; I really appreciate it. Over my shoulder here is Theodore Roosevelt. In 1884, Theodore Roosevelt was frustrated about an election and wrote a letter saying the voice of the people might be the voice of God 51 times out of 100, but the other 49, it may be the voice of a devil or of a fool. Which do you think it was this time in 2016? Well, it is hard to assess because we know for example that Hillary won the popular vote by a sizable margin. We know that there are a substantial number of voters out there who not only voted for me twice but currently support me who also voted for Donald Trump. So I think we have a scrambled political landscape right now. There are some things that we know are a challenge for Democrats - structural problems. For example, population distribution, oftentimes younger voters, minority voters, Democratic voters, are clustered in urban areas. And on the coasts, and so as a consequence you have got a situation where there're not only entire states but also big chunks of states where, if we are not showing up, if we are not in there making an argument, then we are going to lose. And we can lose badly, and that is what happened in this election. Is this just a matter of showing up, or is there something wrong with the argument? No, well, I do not think there is something wrong with the core argument that the Democratic Party has made for years. And the reason we know that is because on the individual issues that Democrats talk about there is strong support. In every survey across the country, people support a higher minimum wage. There are clearly, though, failures on our part to give people in rural areas or in exurban areas, a sense day-to-day that we are fighting for them or connected to them. Some of it is the prism through which they are seeing the political debate take place. They may know less about the work that my administration did on trying to promote collective bargaining or overtime rules. But they know a lot about the controversy around transgender bathrooms because it is more controversial, it attracts more attention.

{"id": 2178, "text": "So part of the reason it is important to show up, and when I say show up, I do not just mean during election time, but to be in there engaging and listening and being with people, is because it then builds trust and it gives you a better sense of how should you talk about issues in a way that feel salient and feel meaningful to people. And I have said this before. Part of the reason I got elected twice - and part of the reason why in a lot of these communities I still have pretty strong support. It was the incredible benefit that I had in first running for the United States Senate in a state that has a lot of rural communities and has a downstate that typically is suspicious of Chicagoans in the city. And then in Iowa, spending months traveling around the state and hearing people's concerns and them hearing me and getting a sense that I get it. So that even during my low points in the presidency, when, you know, poll numbers were bad and news cycle was critical, people always felt as if I still cared about them - which meant that in 2012, I might still lose the overall vote and some of these counties or some of these voting districts, but I might lose 55-45 or 60-40 rather than 80-20. That is as a consequence of not only them seeing me in these places but it is also a consequence of me actually being there and hearing them. Were Democrats failing to do that at every level because your party has lost the majority of races at almost every level at this point? Well, you know, I think that we have not done it as well as we need to. For example, we know that the Republicans, funded through organizations like the Koch brothers, have been very systematic at... Building from the ground up and communicating to state legislators and financing school board races and public utility commission races, and, you know, I am a proud Democrat, but I do think that we have a bias towards national issues and international issues, and as a consequence I think we have ceded too much territory. And I take some responsibility for that. You know, when I came into office, um, you know, we were just putting out fires. We were in a huge crisis situation.

Do you intend to be involved or just give advice? Well, I think it is appropriate for me to give advice because I need some sleep. And I have promised Michelle a nice vacation. My girls are getting old enough now where I am clinging to those very last moments before they are out of the house. But there was a political organization that was built around you that still exists. Well, I am less likely to get involved in all the nuts and bolts of electioneering. In that realm, I am much more likely to just give advice. What I am interested in is just developing a whole new generation of talent. There are such incredible young people who not only worked on my campaign, but I have seen in advocacy groups. I have seen passionate about issues like climate change or conservation, criminal justice reform, you know, campaigns for a livable wage, or health insurance, and making sure that whatever resources, credibility, spotlight that I can bring to help them rise up. That is something that I think I can do well, I think Michelle can do well. That is part of what makes me optimistic about our future because I know those young people are out there ready to lead, and when they start moving into more and more positions of authority, then I think the issues that I care most deeply about are going to be well served. You want to be a talent scout and build the bench that Democrats have admitted they do not have. Well, not only a talent scout but I think also, you know, a coach, a friend, somebody who can build on the incredible work that has already been done by young people and that to a large degree was responsible for getting me elected.

Was that the media's fault for focusing on the wrong things or the candidate's fault for not finding ways to get her message through? There is something about our current political ecosystem - and we are all part of it, the parties, the candidates, the media, the voters - that leads us to avoid going deep into the issues that are really gonna affect people's day-to-day lives, that put a premium on what here in the White House we call the shiny object: the faux scandals, the trumped up controversies, the, um, you know, insults that are flung back and forth.

It is no secret that Russian intelligence officers, or Chinese, or for that matter Israeli, or British, or other intelligence agencies, that their job is to get insight into the workings of other countries that they they are not reading in the newspapers every day. There is a difference between that and the kind of malicious cyberattacks that steal trade secrets or engage in industrial espionage, something that we have seen the Chinese do. And there is a difference between that and activating intelligence, in a way that is designed to influence elections. So we have been working hard to make sure that what we do is proportional.

And it means that we have certain vulnerabilities that some of our adversaries do not have. And this is actually a good example of where, in addition to whatever actions that we take bilaterally against Russia, we have got to spend some time working at an international level to start instituting some norms, the same way we did with things like nuclear weapons because ultimately we can have a situation where everybody's worse off.

It requires us to just say Here is what happened, let us be honest about it and let us not use it as a political football, but let us figure out how we prevent this from happening in the future. It sounds like you hope any response would continue after January 20. But do you have any reason to know that it would? It is up to him. look into my crystal ball and, that is probably a question better directed at the president-elect. I can say that I have had a conversation with the president-elect about our foreign policy generally, and the importance of us making sure that, in how we approach intelligence gathering, in how we think about fighting terrorism and keeping the country secure, in how we think about, you know, our relationship to multilateral organizations, that, you know, we recognize America's exceptionalism, our indispensability in the world, in part draws from our values and our ideals and the fact that even our adversaries generally respect our adherence to rule of law, our transparency, our openness. And if we start losing that, if other countries start seeing that Oh, America does not care about these issues or it is just a might makes right environment, and we are not speaking out on behalf of our values and demonstrating our values, then America is going to be significantly weakened. Should President-elect Trump, once he is inaugurated, use his executive powers in the same way that you have?

{"id": 2185, "text": "Keep in mind though that my strong preference has always been to legislate when I can get legislation done. In my first two years, I was not relying on executive powers, because I had big majorities in the Congress and we were able to get bills done, get bills passed. And even after we lost the majorities in Congress, I bent over backwards consistently to try to find compromise and a legislative solution to some of the big problems that we have got - a classic example being immigration reform, where I held off for years in taking some of the executive actions that I ultimately took in pursuit of a bipartisan solution - one that, by the way, did pass through the Senate on a bipartisan basis with our help. I was very proud of that. I went out of my way to make sure our help was behind the scenes so that Republicans did not feel as if it was going to hurt them politically. At the end of the day, John Boehner and the House Republicans could not pull the trigger on getting it done. And it was only then, after we had exhausted efforts for bipartisan reform that we took some additional steps on immigration executive actions. So my suggestion to the president-elect is, you know, going through the legislative process is always better, in part because it is harder to undo. And that does not mean, though, that he is not going to come in and look at the various agencies and see the rules we have passed and if he wants to reverse some of those rules, that is part of the democratic process. That is , you know, why I tell people to vote because it turns out elections mean something. And this election means even more because the presidency, as has been widely noted, is so powerful. It is grown more powerful over generations. You used your power in certain ways, and even in ways that you'd suggested in the past might be beyond your authority. Well, no, I do not think I have done that. If I am thinking of immigration, for example. Well, what I said with immigration reform was that I could not simply sign a document that legalized 11 million people who had come here illegally and were currently undocumented. What I could do is find categories of people where we could not prioritize as significant risks. But what I always said was we could not solve the basic problem of these folks being in the shadows without legislation.

{"id": 2186, "text": "The question for me is has the presidency become too powerful in your view? I distinguish between domestic policy and foreign policy. I think on foreign policy, the concern I have right now is because we are in a nontraditional war. It is what we call the war on terrorism, although terrorism to some degree is a tactic. We are in a war against a non-state, a set of non-state actors that are operating in the shadows, are in nooks and crannies and crevices around the world. And what that means is that you are never going to have a scene of surrender like we had with the Emperor and Gen. MacArthur, where you do not have a clear start and finish to the use of force. The danger is that over time, Congress starts feeling pretty comfortable with just having ENTITY do all this stuff and not really having to weigh in. So for example, we are still operating in our fight against ISIL without a new congressional authorization. It is the authorization that dates back to 9/11. And I think that is an area that we have to worry about. ENTITY and the executive branch are always going to have greater latitude and greater authority when it comes to protecting America, because sometimes you just have to respond quickly and not everything that is a danger can be publicized and be subject to open debate. And what we have had to do on things like drones, or the NSA, or a number of the tools that we use to penetrate terrorist networks, what we have had to do is to build the guard rails internally. Essentially set up a whole series of processes to guard against government overreach, to reform some practices that I thought over time would threaten civil liberties. You know, there are some critics on the left who would argue we have not gone far enough on that. I would argue that we have gotten it about right, although I am the first one to admit that we did not get it all right on day one. There were times where, for example, with respect to drones, that I had to kind of stop the system for a second, and say You know what?

Having federal bureaucracies and federal regulations, that is not new. I think that what is happened that I do worry about is that Congress has become so dysfunctional, that more and more of a burden is placed on the agencies to fill in the gaps, and the gaps get bigger and bigger because they are not constantly refreshed and tweaked. Let us go back to something like the Affordable Care Act. I could not be prouder of the fact that the uninsured rate has never been lower. That 20 million people have health insurance that we did not have before. Over the course of six years of implementing a very complicated piece of legislation that affects one-sixth of the economy, that there were going to be things we learned that would allow us to improve it. And I do not know how many times I have said to Republicans, both publicly and privately, in State of the Union speeches, in town halls around the country, that if they are willing to engage and work with me, then we can identify ways to tweak and improve this system so that more people have health insurance and it works even better and it is more stable, and build on the things that seemed to have worked.

That then leads to agencies having to scramble to do more work.

Couple of other things ENTITY, Is President-elect Trump right that political correctness in this country has gone too far? We have discussed campus debates here... Because the definition of political correctness is all over the map. And I suspect the president-elect's definition of political correctness would be different than mine. If what is meant by political correctness is that there is some broad disapproval that is expressed when somebody uses a racial epithet, or somebody makes a derogatory comment about women, or about the LGBT community, and people say, Hey, you should not do that. Here is the history of that word. And when you use words like that, you are reinforcing people feeling like they are outsiders, and less than other Americans. I consider that good manners, sound values and hard-fought gains in the nature of American society and American community. I think it is a good thing that we do not think that using the n word is socially acceptable.

Although I happen to approve of affirmative action, but I think that I can have a polite dialogue with somebody who differs from me on that issue. And so, on the one hand, my advice to progressives like myself, and this is advice I give my own daughters who are about to head off to college, is do not go around just looking for insults. If somebody says something you do not agree with, just engage them on their ideas. But speak up for yourself, and if you hear somebody saying something that is insulting, feel free to say to that guy, You know what? You are rude or you are ignorant and take them on. But the thing that I want to emphasize here though is, the irony in this debate is often-times you will hear somebody like a Rush Limbaugh, or other conservative commentators, or you know, radio shock jocks, or some conservative politicians, who are very quick to jump on any evidence of progressives being politically correct, but who are constantly aggrieved and hypersensitive about the things they care about, and are continually feeding this sense of victimization, and that they are being subject to reverse discrimination. Look, I had to live through controversies like the notion that I was trying to kill Christmas. Well, where'd that come from? Well, you know, He said 'Happy Holidays' instead of 'Merry Christmas,' so that must be evidence of him either not being a Christian or not caring about Christmas. It sounds funny now, but you will have entire debates in conservative circles around that. So it cuts both ways.

I have been accused by friends, enemies, my wife, of sometimes being overly optimistic. But what can I tell you, this is this is my temperament generally. And we are going through some growing pains right now, because the world is changing really fast, and it has throughout my presidency. I started my presidency inheriting a massive crisis of proportions that we have not seen since the 1930s. It laid bare some long-term and troubling trends about globalization, and technology, and rising inequality, and the fragility of our financial systems, and the way in which middle-class folks felt they were getting squeezed. And the fact that the ladders of opportunity seem to be farther and fewer between for people who are trying to get out of poverty. And throughout that process, we also then started seeing - because when the economy's not doing well some other tensions get laid bare - changing attitudes about sexual orientation, and about race, and about the nature of families. And all of this has been amped up by the revolution in information, throwing through social media and the Internet. It is been a lot of stuff that is been coming at people really quickly, and it is made folks anxious. But I do think that part of the reason for these tensions is because we have been starting to wrestle with some things that ultimately are solvable if we make some good decisions. And so we have some time to say to ourselves, even though it is stable right now, the trend lines are such where more and more jobs are going to be digitalized, more and more jobs are going to be robotized. What are we going to do to make sure that as more workers are moving out of manufacturing into the service sector, that they are getting a decent wage? How are we going to create more jobs once self-driving cars eliminate a bunch of well-paying jobs of just driving and moving stuff around? How do we rebuild our infrastructure and rebuild our education system? We can solve these things, but it is going to be challenging.

But the good news is we have got time to do it. With respect to race and the relationship between the African-American community and police, all these smartphones suddenly taking pictures are not documenting a suddenly worsening relationship between the African-American community and the police. They are recording what has been a long-standing tension and the sense on the part of police that they are put in a very difficult situation of trying to manage law enforcement in poor communities where guns are easily accessible, the African-American community being rightly convinced that there is a long history of racial bias in our criminal justice system. So, my feeling is that if everybody takes a breath, and if we can structure a conversation that is less about how somebody else is trying to take advantage of me, and structure the conversation around how can we work together to solve problems that makes everybody better off? that America can emerge stronger.

Now, that is not unique in the annals of American history. There have been times when the Democrats were wrapped around the axle, and extreme wings were setting the agenda. And I think the Republicans will get out of this. But right now, at least, partly in reaction to my presidency and the political decisions that they made, they find themselves having created an atmosphere in which even somebody like Paul Ryan is viewed as not sufficiently conservative, or if he does just some of the basic work of governance that somehow he has betrayed the base and is decried as a Republican in name only. And when you have that kind of environment, it is very hard to get the kind of cooperation that is necessary for us to solve problems that people are concerned about and that I am assuming that during the course of your conversations they have raised repeatedly. Let me ask one of those concerns. In Kansas, we spoke with a woman named Heather Gray, who said, 16 years ago I was making $10 an hour. Today, she said, I make $10 an hour. The problem of stagnant wages, of course, did not start with your presidency, but it has not improved much. Well, we have got some long-term trends that we have to battle, and when I came into office we were in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. We have successfully dug ourselves out of that hole. The country has, but wages have not improved for average people ... I am going to answer your question. So we had unemployment at 10 percent. It is now below 5. We had a housing market that had completely collapsed. We had a situation in which people had lost trillions of dollars in wealth in their 401's and they have recovered it. In fact, Americans have gotten back about $30 trillion of wealth since I came into office. So by every measure, the economy has improved. But the long-term trends that had occurred before I took office and have continued is a combination of globalization and automation, leading to more downward pressure on wages because you need fewer workers to make a certain amount of stuff; and entire job sectors being shrunk or eliminated; more and more people going into the service sector, and in the service sector, historically wages have been lower.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio4", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-4", "publication_date": "27-06-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

This is why we fought for higher minimum wages. This is why, I think, it is so important that as we move forward, if we are going to benefit from all the huge productivity increases and efficiencies that arise out of the global supply chain and automated everything, then we are going to have to redesign that social compact to make sure that everybody is getting a decent wage. It is not as if we need a radical restructuring of the economy. If we had a minimum wage that required everybody to get - be above poverty if they are working full time, that would go a long way towards alleviating some of the trends that we talked about. And in fact, we have seen wage growth now begin to occur over the last couple of years, but it is not happening as fast as it should. There is a writer for the Financial Times, Philip Stephens, who wrote something interesting after Britain voted to leave the European Union last week. He wrote in a column, globalization is not working, that it may make countries richer, but the majority of people are not benefiting. He was writing about Britain, but you mentioned globalization in the context of the United States. I think he is right that what you are seeing across the advanced economies is that when you have globalization and suddenly there is competition from everywhere, that empowers people who have a lot of skills, can use the Internet. Suddenly they have access to all the markets. And what that means is, if you are very good at something, if you are LeBron James or you are Seinfeld or you are ENTITY Jobs, then suddenly you can leverage your skills in ways that you could never do before. If you are a manual worker, and are doing work that can be replaced not just by a lower-wage worker somewhere else but more frequently by a machine, then you are in a tougher spot because you now are competing against the entire world instead of just the people who live around you. And that is why it is so important for us to think about how do we make sure that everybody is participating in that global economy.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio4", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-4", "publication_date": "27-06-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And I think you see that somewhat in the Brexit vote. You see some of it in both the Sanders campaign and the Trump campaign, people feeling as if we are potentially being left behind. Or what is the cure to this whole thing? And the notion is that, from my perspective, we are not going to suddenly eliminate the global supply chain. We are not going to disentangle the world economy. It is just too integrated now by virtue of technology and the Internet. And so what we have to do is to make sure that wages around the world are beginning to rise, that environmental standards around the world are beginning to rise, that within our own countries we are providing the education that people need to compete in this global economy, with new skills for the new industries that are out there, that we invest more in things like infrastructure that make us competitive, and also, by the way, cannot be shipped away. I actually think that, over time, it can raise everybody's living standards and create a more peaceful world. But if you do it in a way where the benefits of globalization are only for the elites who are flying around from capital to capital and looking at their investment portfolios on a laptop or a computer screen, and they are not worrying, they feel disengaged from their national economies and their national workers and their national communities, then you are going to see a reaction to it. Donald Trump talked about global elites after the vote in Britain. Is Trump right that there are big parallels between what motivated the British vote and what people are feeling and thinking about in the election this year in the United States? Well, first of all, I think it is important to remember that Mr. Trump embodies global elites and has taken full advantage of it his entire life. So he is hardly a spokesperson for - a legitimate spokesperson for a populist surge from working-class people, on either side of the Atlantic.

Having said all that, the U.S. economy has not only recovered but we are about 10 percent larger than we were pre-crisis, when I came into office. You have had a decade of stagnation there, partly because of austerity measures that we did not duplicate. The Republicans attempted to impose those kinds of strategies here and I resisted them, and I would argue that that is part of the reason why we did a lot better. We reformed our banking system a lot faster. And so overall, I think that the differences are greater than the similarities. But what is absolutely true is that the ability to tap into a fear that people may have about losing control, and to offer some sort of vague, nostalgic feelings about how, you know, we will make Britain great again or we will make America great again. And the subtext for that is somehow that a bunch of foreigners and funny-looking people are coming in here and changing the basic character of the nation. I think that some of that is out there, both in Europe and the United States. And again, that is not unique to England. You have seen it in the Le Pen Party in France. You see it in some of the far-right parties in other parts of Europe as well. You mentioned people fearful of change. The way that voters express that when we talk with them is that they are concerned about changing the traditions, values or institutions of this country that have made the country great over time. Immigrants do bring new ideas, new cultures, different religions, other things. Does it matter particularly if they do change the country? Well, I think that there are some bedrock values that should not change, and in fact, have not changed. The values of our Constitution and the Bill of Rights, the values of free speech, the values of religious tolerance, the values of pluralism, the values of us being a nation of immigrants that can absorb people from every corner of the world and yet at the end of the day, because we all pledge allegiance to a flag and a creed, we become one.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio4", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-4", "publication_date": "27-06-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

They are striver's values; they are the values that say we are going to make something of ourselves, regardless of the station in which we were born. When you look at second-generation immigrants, or third-generation immigrants, they are as American as any kid here. That is part of what separates us from the United Kingdom or Europe, is we have had that tradition of being a nation of immigrants. And so, you know, when people are concerned about some of the changes that immigrants may bring, you know, they need to go back and read what people were saying about their grandparents or great-grandparents when they came. You read about the description of Irish who arrived, and the language that is being used is identical to the language that Mr. Trump uses about Mexicans. You know, when Southern Europeans were coming instead of Northern Europeans, there was absolute certainty that America was going down the tubes because these swarthy, you know, folks were coming here and they had different attitudes. And Catholics were coming, which meant that the pope was going to control us. And - this kind of xenophobia is part of the American tradition, and the good news is that, you know, after these spasms of it, it typically fades away, because the immigrants who come here, in fact, are coming here precisely to embrace the opportunities of being American. Is there a danger that Europe, after this Brexit vote, will turn inward, focus increasingly on its own problems and its own turmoil, and be less active in the world? Well, I think that the best way to think about this is a pause button has been pressed on the project of full European integration. I would not overstate it. There has been a little bit of hysteria post-Brexit vote, as if, somehow, NATO's gone and the trans-Atlantic alliance is dissolving and every country is rushing off to its own corner.

And you have a European Union government in Brussels that, because it needs consensus from, you know, more than a - more than a couple of dozen countries, oftentimes seems overly bureaucratic and deadlocked. And I think this will be a moment in which all of Europe says, all right, let us take a breath, and let us figure out how do we maintain some of our national identities, how do we preserve the benefits of integration and how do we deal with some of the frustrations that our own voters are feeling. But the basic core values of Europe, the tenets of liberal, market-based democracies, those are not changing. The interests that we have in common with Europe remain the same. They are going to have to worry about working with us on the Middle East; they are going to have to worry about us working together to deal with an aggressive Russia. They are going to have to deal with us, with respect to how do we continue to uphold international rules and norms around the world that have served both the U.S. and Europe very well. And so, I do not anticipate that there is going to be major cataclysmic changes as a consequence of this. Keep in mind that Norway is not a member of the European Union, but Norway is one of our closest allies. They align themselves on almost every issue with Europe and us. They are a place that is continually supporting the kinds of initiatives internationally that we support. And if over the course of what is going to be at least a two-year negotiation between England and Europe, Great Britain ends up being affiliated to Europe like Norway is, the average person is not to notice a big change. I think that is entirely up to them. On this side of the Atlantic, we heard from a number of people about immigration when we traveled across the country. One of them was a man named Jose Luis Valdez. He is a business owner, a restaurant owner in Kansas City, Kan. So, he is getting ready to vote for the first time, but he has followed politics for a long time. He knows that you won the Latino vote very heavily in both your elections.

And I think it would be pretty hard to argue that I have not put everything I have had into getting this done. But, you know, one of the things that I have learned in this presidency is that until you get something done, people are going to be frustrated. You think of the incredible progress we have made during the course of my presidency with respect to LGBT rights - the rights of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgender - the historic speed with which we consolidated equal treatment for that population And you know, these days, if I go before an LGBT crowd, you know, people are cheering and saying I have been one of their greatest champions. But it was only about three or four years ago when, you know, I would get heckled in some LGBT events because, you know, marriage equality had not gotten done yet. And it did not matter how many times I told them, look, you know, it is - it is going to get done. It is just - it turns out that the wheels in democracy do not always move as quickly as you'd hope. And I cannot just do these things with a stroke of the pen. You know, that is - that is sort of the nature of all social change here. And so, if you - if you were interviewing one of the DREAM Act kids, who over the last several years have been able to get a driver's license, a permit to work or to school, have joined our military, they - they would not say that they have been used. They would say, thank you. And I think that is the reason the vast majority of Latino voters continue to support me, because they see the effort that has been put in.

And to - one way or another, by next year, we are going to have either my administrative solution to immigration reform done, it will be in train, because it will have been decided on and - and will no longer be blocked. Or, alternatively, you know, Mr. Trump will win, in which case, you know, we will have a whole bunch of other problems on our hands with respect to immigration. So, in some ways, this is how the democratic process works.

It is not as convenient as, you know, people would always like, but this is a big country with a lot of diverse views. Let me ask about a passionate young person that we met along the way. He is an activist now in Baltimore. He was active in the protests after the death of Freddie Gray ... who was in a police van, and died later, as you know. And he was unhappy with a statement that you made at the time, when you were supportive of peaceful protests but also criticized what you called criminals and thugs who had looted stores. He felt that you were being too harsh and went on to say in our interview that you were speaking from a position of privilege, his suggestion being that maybe you did not quite get what was going on in the streets. What would you say to him? Well, obviously, I do not know him personally, so we would have to have a longer conversation. What I would say is that the Black Lives Matter movement has been hugely important in getting all of America to - to see the challenges in the criminal justice system differently. And I could not be prouder of the activism that has been involved. And it is making a difference.

And the notion that they are making a political statement is not always the case because these are businesses oftentimes owned by African-Americans. You have situations in which suddenly - friends of mine in Baltimore, their mothers who are elderly have to now travel across town to get their medicines because the local drugstore got torn up. And making excuses for them I think is a mistake. There are ways of bringing about social change that are powerful and that have the ability to pull the country together and maintain the moral high ground and there are approaches where I may understand the frustrations, but they are counterproductive. If I were to summarize what else this young man said, I might say that he feels that he is trying to overturn what he sees is a racist or corrupt system and that you have become part of it.

And if it has not gotten fixed in a couple of weeks, people are going to say, why did not you fix it?

There is another passage which I had not even noticed before, in which you say there is a similar anger among some in the white community who do not feel particularly privileged by their race and do feel frustrated that they are losing jobs, losing pensions, feel like they are losing ground. Looking back, were you describing there the same force that is driving much of our election discussion here in 2016? Well, not only the election and discussion driving 2016; this has been an ongoing theme in American history. You can go back and during Jim Crow and segregation and you have got black sharecroppers who have nothing and alongside them, poor white farmers who do not have that much more except for the fact that they are white. And the degree to which a lot of politics in the South were specifically designed to make sure that that sharecropper and that white farmer did not get together to question how the economy was structured and how they both could benefit, that is - that is one of the oldest stories in American politics. So - so it is not surprising that what I said in 2008 still holds true today. It was true for a long time. The nature of racial bias in this country is unique and the challenges that African-Americans have faced are incomparable. Native Americans in this country, you know, were burdened by extraordinary bias and cruelty, as well. And it is probably not useful to sort of catalog every possible group's grievances. What is true, though, is that as I travel around the country, what a black, working-class person has in common with a white, working-class person is significant.

You have seen 20 million people have health insurance that did not have it before and health care inflation actually going down so that, you know, we have saved trillions of dollars in cost relative to what we are expected to be paying over the course of programs like Medicare and Medicaid. What we have seen is a financial system that is a lot sounder. We see an LGBT community that is - is recognized as equal in ways that they were not before. You have seen an entire generation grow up, I think, feeling as if the old divisions do not make sense. And you know, I feel pretty confident that as long as we do the work over the next several months and then continue that work over the next several years, that we will have emerged from this era stronger, more prosperous, more secure and adhering more closely to the values and ideals that make America exceptional. We have gone across the country, we have gone across the country asking people how their lives have changed in the last eight years. How has your life changed in the last eight years? Well, everybody's teased me about how gray I am and that is OK. That picture of you and Derek Jeter, that was something. My - my daughters have grown up and I think for any father out there, seeing your kids come into office - when I came in office, they were so much younger than I realized at the time, I think. And for them to be these amazing young women now, that changes your life more than just about anything. It is interesting, though, that my fundamental belief in public service, my fundamental belief in the capacity of politics to - to solve problems, my belief in this country is stronger, not weaker.

And at the point where they are willing to say no to the most extreme parts of their caucus, I think that there are a whole bunch of Republicans both in the Senate and the House who recognize this is a bad strategy.

Do you believe that? Keep in mind -- if you are a Republican -- and we have heard some Republicans make this argument -- some of those who are leading the charge on this make this argument -- and essentially, what they are saying is, once this is fully implemented and millions of people who currently do not have health care have health care at reasonable prices and protections are in place for consumers across the board, that it will be sufficiently successful and popular that people will not want to repeal it. So the notion is we have got to stop it before people like it too much. Well, part of the argument is sometimes, people come to like things that the government cannot afford anymore. Well, this is -- this is the argument that was made with respect to Social Security; this is the argument that was made to Medicare. It turns out, actually, people liked it, and we could afford it. And unlike the prescription drug plan that was passed by Republicans, which now is very popular with seniors, although at the time that it was passed was actually less popular than the Affordable Care Act, according to the polls -- we paid for the Affordable Care Act. It does not add to the deficit. If the assumptions in current law held. Well -- but the assumptions so far not only have held, they have actually exceed expectations. Health care costs have gone up slower since we passed the Affordable Care Act. There were great predictions coming from the Republicans that health care costs would go up even faster; that has not happened. There were predictions that the market places that we are setting up -- essentially, the group plans where people buy health insurance -- would not offer a good deal to consumers. And so far, the bids have come in from insurance companies, and lo and behold, they have actually come under the estimates that the government had so far. So the truth is that every prediction about how bad the Affordable Care Act would be for individual consumers out there has not proven to be true.

Health exchanges are supposed to open; websites and other locations across the country where people without insurance can shop for private plans. I asked ENTITY if he was prepared for significant glitches as the exchanges open. In the first week, first month, first three months, I would suspect that there will be glitches. This is 50 states, a lot of people signing up for something, and there are going to be problems. And I guarantee you, there will be problems because we have got precedent. When Massachusetts, just one state, set this up, it took quite a long time. It took several months before everything was smoothed out. Of course, the same was true with Medicare and Social Security and every other social program that we have set up -- the Children's Health Insurance Program. But what we are confident about is that people will be able to take a look and find out whether this is something that is going to be good for their families. You have talked a lot during your time in office about the widening gap between the rich and everybody else. This is a decades-long trend, but a good part of that trend has now taken part -- taken place on your watch. Overwhelming majority of the increase in income in this country went to the wealthiest 1 percent. Why is that happening on your watch? Well, it is one of my biggest concerns. And part of it has to do with the fact that these long-term trends have accelerated. Globalization, combined with technology, have stripped away a lot of the basic security that middle-income people had because a lot of those middle-income jobs have left. Either they were moved overseas, they were replaced with technology -- whether you are talking about a bank teller, a travel agent, a high-level administrator in a lot of companies, if you go to many manufacturers, it is all roboticized. So some of the -- that is part of the trend. Are your efforts not helping with this? The law was passed under a Democratic Congress. Well, no -- there are no doubts that what we have done has helped.

And he argued, based on his analysis, that it is really inevitable, it is going to get worse, and the thing for public officials to do is to adapt to it rather than try to change it. Well, I do not accept that. America is, always been, at its best when everybody who is willing to work hard has a chance to succeed. I mean, we are seeing the same trends in Scandinavian countries that historically were -- prided themselves on great equality. We have seen it magnified in less developed countries and emerging markets. So these are global trends that we are going to have to fight against. But if we are educating a workforce that has the skills they need to compete, if we have a tax system that is fair and not rewarding those who can afford high-priced accountants and lawyers, if we are rebuilding our infrastructure in this country, not only to make us more competitive but because those create jobs that cannot be exported, if we are increasing a minimum wage so that it is reflective of the same purchasing power that existed many years ago, if we are creating more ladders of opportunity for people who are locked in neighborhoods that have been abandoned and small towns where factories have closed, if we do those things, then we can lessen the impact of these broader market forces. On the one hand, they create a situation in which consumer goods are cheap and they create a situation in which we can have access to goods and services that we would never have had before. On the other hand, it does create a situation in which a lot of the jobs that are created are at the very top, high-skilled, you know, creative work that cannot be replicated, or at the bottom, low-skilled jobs. What we do not have are those jobs in the middle that we have to really focus on building, because we can outcompete anybody when we have smart policies. You have said you will not negotiate over an extension of the debt ceiling. I just want to make sure that I am clear on that.

At that point, any president -- not just me -- any president is subject to that kind of blackmail continuously. If you had a Republican president in here and a Democratic speaker said, we are not going to raise the debt ceiling unless you pass background checks on guns; we are not going to pass the debt ceiling unless you raise the corporate income tax by 30 percent, you know, that Republican president would find him or herself in a similar position. Raising the debt ceiling is not raising the debt, it is simply saying Congress is authorizing the Treasury to pay for those things that Congress has already approved. So a potential debt-ceiling crisis approaches, even as the president tries to manage ordinary business. He had hoped to name a new Fed chairman by now, giving Congress time to act this year to find a successor to Ben Bernanke. As he pondered that decision, I asked if the president wants the next Fed chair to change course for the Fed. He began by noting that the Fed is a dual mandate, one part is protecting the currency. Part of that mandate is also full employment, making sure that the economy is growing in such a way that people have the chance to succeed. Should the Fed be doing more in that department? Well, I think that the Fed has to constantly monitor where the economy is moving, but we cannot put the entire burden on the Fed. And this brings us back to the original point about potential government shutdowns or potential default because we are not paying our bills. The -- we have dug ourselves out of a deep hole, and the economy now has grown. We have created jobs for 42 consecutive months. We have created 7.5 million new jobs. Manufacturing's come back in ways that many people would not have anticipated.

And I think that the framework that we have put forward, which says not only that people's taxes do not go up on January 1st, but also that we extend unemployment insurance for a year, that we make sure that key provisions like the college tax credit, the child tax credit, the earned-income tax credit are included -- that that framework is going to serve as the basis for compromise.

My understanding is that the Senate's going to vote on the package over the next several days and that at the end of the day, people are going to conclude we do not want 2 million people suddenly without unemployment insurance and not able to pay their rent, not able to pay their mortgage, not able to pay their house note. I think that people are also going to understand that the single most important thing we can do for all of our constituencies is to make sure that the recovery that is taking place right now gets stronger.

One came from a man named Tom Pluck of Montclair, New Jersey -- a man who describes himself as a supporter. Please ask him how keeping the tax rate for the richest the same as it has been for a decade creates one single job. It does not , which is why I was opposed to it -- and I am still opposed to it. The issue here is not whether I think that the tax cuts for the wealthy are a good or smart thing to do. I have said repeatedly that I think they are not a smart thing to do, particularly because we have got to borrow money, essentially, to pay for them. The problem is, is that this is the single issue that the Republicans are willing to scotch the entire deal for. either I allow 2 million people who are currently getting unemployment insurance not to get it; either I allow the recovery that we are on to be endangered or we make a compromise now, understanding that for the next two years this is going to be a central battle as part of a larger discussion about how do we reform our tax code so that it is fair and how do we make sure that we actually are dealing with the deficit and debt in an intelligent way? You mentioned having to borrow money to do this. Let me ask you about something that both Democrats and Republicans have raised.

I put together a fiscal commission -- over the resistance, I should note, of a number of Republicans who originally had supported it. I think that Bowles-Simpson did a good job of sparking a conversation about how we need to move forward to deal with our medium- and long-term deficits. There have been other commissions that have been put forward over the last several weeks. And I am going to have to put a budget out that shows how I think we make some -- a serious dent in our debt and our deficit. I think every economist -- and by the way, the commissions who looked at this as well -- realize that because we have got a recovery that is still not as strong as we'd like it to be. The vast majority of economists, as well as both the chairman of the Bowles-Simpson commission, as well as other commissions, have suggested that because the recovery is just taking off and is still not producing as many jobs as it needs to, that it actually makes sense for us not do anything that contracts the economy right now because the single most important thing we can do for deficit reduction is actually expand economic growth. That 1 percent of additional economic growth brings in a whole lot of revenue even with no changes in the tax code. And so the payroll tax provision that is included in this package is going to help spark economic growth that will help. Now, it does not solve our medium- and long-term problems, so we are going to still have to make some very tough decisions -- and these too are going to be unpopular. I am going to get criticism from Democrats and Republicans throughout the year in terms of the choices that I am going to be forcing Congress to take a square look at.

Will not Republicans argue -- and, in fact, will not reality argue -- that any cuts will have to be even deeper because this package that you are pushing for now will mean there is even less government revenue? Actually, I think that if you talk to economists, both conservative and liberal, what they will say is the problem is not next year. The problem is, how are we dealing with our medium-term debt and deficit, and how are we dealing with our long- term debt and deficit? And most of that has to do with entitlements -- particularly Social Security and Medicaid. We have made some progress as a consequence of my health-care bill in identifying areas where we can start bending the cost curve on health care.

And if they can afford it, they'd buy things that they'd like to have, but the first thing they do is take care of the things that we have to have.

We -- we are not going to be able to deal with our deficit just by eliminating foreign aid, for example, which some people suggest. That only accounts for 1 percent of our budget. It is not going to happen just because we eliminate earmarks. I happen to think that that is a bad way of doing business, but earmarks account for 1 percent or less of the federal budget. We have got to look at a whole range of things -- where the money goes. And that includes entitlements; that includes defense; that includes a whole host of discretionary spending where we can probably do more and do it smarter with less money, if we are actually making some tough choices. Because this plan projects extending the Bush tax cuts for two years, it is been widely presumed that in two years or less, you are going to have another big fight over whether to extend these tax cuts. This week, my colleague Scott Horsley asked you if there was a different possibility here. He asked if you were going to use this two-year window to push for a broader overhaul of the tax code. I want you to expand on that yes. What do you plan to do to the tax code in the next couple of years? Well, I think we are going to have to have a conversation over the next year. And if you think about the last time we reformed our tax system back in 1986 -- it did not happen right away, by the way. It required a lot of conversations among a lot of different parties. But people of good will came together and realized that if we eliminate what happens to the tax code every decade or so -- loopholes get built in, special interest provisions get built in -- the nominal rates end up high, but the actual tax rates that well- connected folks or people who have good accountants pay end up being a lot lower; ordinary people end up getting squeezed.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradiosmorningedition", "title": "Interview With Steve Inskeep on National Public Radio's Morning Edition", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radios-morning-edition", "publication_date": "10-12-2010", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

So what I believe is, is that we have got to start that conversation next year. I think we can get some broad bipartisan agreement that it needs to be done. But it is going to require a lot of hard work to actually make it happen. Your deficit commission talked about lowering everybody's tax rate and eliminating deductions, such as changing the home mortgage deduction and many other deductions as well. That is the kind of plan you are talking about. Well, I have not specifically endorsed that plan. What I am saying is, is that the general concept of simplifying -- eliminating loopholes, eliminating deductions, eliminating exemptions in certain categories -- might make sense if, in exchange, people's rates are lower. That may end up being a more efficient way of doing business. Does that completely change this debate over the Bush tax cuts? And that is that people like myself who have been incredibly blessed and who have a lot more income and wealth can afford to pay more than we currently are paying. I strongly believe that. I believed that during the campaign for ENTITY. I believed it when I was campaigning during these midterms. I still believe it. And so the fight about what the top 1 percent or 2 percent of America should be contributing as part of our contribution to rebuilding America and putting it on a competitive footing -- that basic principle is one that I continue to believe in and I will be fighting for over the next two years. By making this agreement with Republicans on taxes and on the economy, is it your understanding -- and do you have any understanding with the Republicans -- that if you are able to act quickly on that agreement, you will then get a vote on many other things you are hoping to get by the end of the year, particularly the START nuclear treaty -- the arms deal with Russia? Well, the START treaty is something that I absolutely think has to get done before Congress leaves for Christmas vacation.

And a couple came to mind who were able to express what they were trying to do in the world in about a sentence. Reagan wanted to roll back communism by whatever means. Lincoln has a famous letter in which he says, I would save the union by the shortest means under the Constitution. As you look at the moment of history that you occupy, do you think you can put into a sentence what you are trying to accomplish in the world? I am not sure I can do it in a sentence because we are fortunate in many ways. We do not face an existential crisis. We do not face a civil war. We do not face a Soviet Union that is trying to rally a bloc of countries and that could threaten our way of life. Instead, what we have is, as I say in the speech, this moment in which we are incredibly fortunate to have a strong economy that is getting stronger, no military peer that threatens us, no nation-state that anytime soon intends to go to war with us. But we have a world order that is changing very rapidly and that can generate diffuse threats, all of which we have to deal with. And I think that the most important point of the speech today for me is how we define American leadership in part is through our military might, but only in part, that American leadership in the 21st century is going to involve our capacity to build international institutions, coalitions that can act effectively, and the promotion of norms, rules, laws, ideals and values that create greater prosperity and peace, not just in our own borders, but outside as well. Is your sentence then pursuing U.S. interests abroad without going to war? Well, there are going to be times where we might have to go to war. And that is why I think it is very important for us not to get into these simplistic ways of thinking about it, either we pull back entirely and we are isolationist, or alternatively, every problem around the world is ours to manage.

When it comes to the kinds of issues, though, that dominate the headlines - a conflict in Syria, a Russian incursion into Ukraine, the kidnapping of 200 young girls in Nigeria - in those circumstances, we are going to be most effective when we use a wide range of tools - diplomacy, sanctions, appeals to international law. In some cases, a judicious use of military force may make sense. But in those circumstances, it has to be in a multilateral system where other countries are participating, we are not going alone, because when we make sure that other countries are participating, that means that we have done our homework, we have thought through the consequences, we have built legitimacy, and we are not carrying the burden entirely on our own. What should leaders like Syria's Bashar Assad or Russia's Vladimir Putin take away from this speech, in which you did speak passionately about not going to war unnecessarily and said you were haunted by the deaths of American soldiers? Well, I think they can take away from it that they have to be on guard when they act outside of international norms, that we are going to push aggressively against them. We are not always going to push using military actions initially. There may be circumstances in which we mobilize in the international community to take international action. But as I spoke about, when you look at events in Ukraine over the last two months, there is no doubt that our ability to mobilize international opinion rapidly has changed the balance and the equation in Ukraine. I just spoke yesterday to the newly elected president of Ukraine. Putin has just announced that he is moving his troops back from the borders of Ukraine. And that is an application of American leadership that is sustainable, consistent and is most likely to produce the kinds of results we want. It is interesting about Ukraine, though, ENTITY, because a lot of analysts have looked at that situation and said this is an area where Putin may have had a weak hand, but he gained. He gained Crimea. He asserted his influence over Ukraine. You speak of Ukraine, though, as a success. Do you feel that you have been successful in achieving your aims?

And from Mr. Putin's perspective, he was operating from a position of weakness. He felt as if he was being further and further surrounded by NATO members, folks who are looking west economically, from a security perspective. And even in Ukraine, the crown jewel of the former Soviet system, outside of Russia, a oligarchy that was corrupt was rejected by people on the streets. And so what you saw was a scrambling, a reaction to people in the Ukraine saying, we want a different way of life. The fact that Crimea, which historically is dominated by native Russians and Russian speakers, was annexed illegally does not in any way negate the fact that the way of life, the systems of economic organization, the notions of rule of law, those values that we hold dear, are ascendant, and you know, the other side is going to be on the defense. That does not mean that we think that Ukraine should not have a good relationship with Russia. And I have said directly to Mr. Putin we want, ultimately, Ukrainians to make a decision about their own futures, and that, I assume, will include strong relations with Russia as well as with Europe. You are going to make Russia give Crimea back. Do you have the ability or the leverage to do that? Well, you know, I think we are going to have to see how it plays itself out. I am going to see Mr. Poroshenko, the newly elected president of Crimea - or newly elected president of Ukraine, next week, and I am sure that'll be a topic of discussion. Let me ask about Syria, ENTITY. White House officials have said that you are reviewing the possibility of military training for Syrian rebels. There has been, it is said, limited training by intelligence agencies up to now. This seems to fit with something you described in your speech when you talked about a $5 billion counterterrorism fund, which would affect places including Syria. I'd like to understand what you think has changed in Syria; what, if anything, is different about the situation in Syria, as opposed to a couple of years ago, when some of your advisers wanted larger-scale training of the rebels, and I believe you declined.

And what we do not want to do is set folks up for failure. What we do not want to do is make promises that we cannot keep. I cannot speak to all the work that has been done with respect to both the political opposition as well as the armed opposition that are fighting against Mr. Assad, but I think it is been stated publicly we have been supporting them. Ultimately, I did not think then and I still do not believe that American military actions can resolve what is increasingly a sectarian civil war, and I also believe that, ultimately, the only way you are going to get a resolution that works for the Syrian people and the region is going to - is going to require some sort of political accommodation between the various groups there. But what we can do is to work with the neighbors in the region - Jordan, Turkey, the Gulf states, Lebanon - to deal with the refugee flows that are coming out of Syria, to deal with the humanitarian crisis that exists there and to build on the framework, the progress that we have made over the last couple of years. We have seen some success in the Syrian opposition gaining more capacity, gaining more training, gaining more effectiveness; and building on some of that success, it is conceivable that in combination with the other work that is done on the diplomatic front, that we are able to tip what happens in Syria so that it is more likely that we can arrive at a political resolution. Are conditions better now, then, for a more robust aiding of the rebels and training of the rebels than in the past? I think, in many ways, the conditions are worse. But the capacity of some of the opposition is better than it was before, which is understandable. The moderate opposition, as opposed to the jihadists that have seen the chaos there as an opportunity to gain a foothold, those are hardened fighters. When you talk about the moderate opposition, many of these people were farmers or dentists or maybe some radio reporters who did not have a lot of experience fighting.

It is understood, of course, the U.S. has specific commitments; for example, to defend Japan - I'd like to know if you have a larger objective in East Asia. Does the United States have an interest beyond its specific alliances in preventing China from dominating East Asia and the waters around East Asia, where China's been making some aggressive moves? Well, we do not have an interest in stopping China from becoming successful. China is the most populous country on Earth, at some - But I am asking their power, not their success. But at some level, they are going to be a big dog in that neighborhood, and we welcome China's peaceful rise. In many ways, it would be a bigger national security problem for us if China started falling apart at the seams. So we - we want the Chinese people to steadily have a higher standard of living; we want China to have increased capacity to participate in international efforts around issues like climate change. We have a very specific concern when China is not following basic international norms, basic rules of the road, where it does not feel bound by the kind of international practices that have helped to underwrite China's rise. I mean, part of the reason China's been successful is there is been relative peace in Asia, there has been freedom of commerce in Asia, freedom of navigation in Asia. All that facilitates the trade that is creating great wealth inside of China. Well, if in fact that international order has benefited China, then we expect China to help uphold the very rules that have made them successful, not take advantage of them. And so there are basic principles that big countries do not just push little countries around by virtue of size. There are mechanisms whereby, through international law, maritime disputes can be resolved. And what we have done then is worked with the countries of the region to say let us create a code of conduct that - in which, without taking any position on whether this particular rock in the middle of the water belongs to this party or that party, let us find a systematic, legal way for us to resolve these disputes without resolving to conflict.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnprnews", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of NPR News", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-npr-news", "publication_date": "28-05-2014", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And every once in a while, a pitch is going to come right over home plate that you can knock out for a home run. But you do not swing at every pitch. And we have opportunities right now, for example, and I talked about today, to advance an Iranian agreement on their nuclear program that could be historic. We may not get it, but there is a chance that it could still happen. I have not yet given up on the possibility that both Israelis and Palestinians can see their self-interest in a peace deal that would provide Israel security that is recognized by its neighbors and make sure that Palestinians have a state of their own.

But in the meantime, the work that we do to help countries in North Africa secure their borders and root out terrorism, the work that we do to, you know, make sure that we have higher standards for labor protection and environmental protection when it comes to trade in Asia, the work that we do in making sure that young people in Latin America are coming to the United States to study through exchange programs so that - and that U.S. students are able to go to those countries to develop the commercial ties and cultural ties in the Western Hemisphere, you know, that stuff's not sexy.

I think it is very important as we end the war that originally gave - gave life to Guantanamo that we now wind it down. Could you not send more prisoners back now? Well, the - you know, Congress has placed some restraints on us. But they have loosened those restraints. And I promise you that we are using every possible available avenue. In some cases, it is hard to return prisoners because the countries where they come from do not want them or cannot provide us assurances that they can control them. But what I know is that we cannot in good conscience maintain a system of indefinite detention in which individuals who have not been tried and convicted are held permanently in this legal limbo outside of this country. That is contrary to U.S. traditions. It feeds terrorist propaganda. It is not ultimately going to be effective when it comes to dealing with the long-term terrorist threat.

Resolving the underlying crisis is going to be something that requires, ultimately, the key players there to recognize that there has to be a transition into new government. And in the absence of that, it is not going to work. One of the key players now is Russia. A year ago when we did this interview, there was some saber-rattling between the United States and Russia on the Ukrainian border. Now, it is also going on in Syria. Putin seems to be challenging that leadership. Let -- let us think about this -- Well, he is moved -- he is moved troops into Syria, for one.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevekroftcbs", "title": "Interview with Steve Kroft of CBS", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-kroft-cbs", "publication_date": "11-10-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 2234, "text": "He is got people on the ground. Two, the Russians are conducting military operations in -- in the Middle East for the first time since World War II -- bombing the people that we are supporting. So let me ask you this question. When I came into office, Ukraine was governed by a corrupt ruler who was a stooge of Mr. Putin. Syria was Russia's only ally in the region. And today, rather than being able to count on their support and maintain the base they had in Syria, which they have had for a long time, Mr. Putin now is devoting his own troops, his own military, just to barely hold together by a thread his sole ally. He is challenging your leadership, ENTITY. He is challenging your leadership. Well, ENTITY, I have got to tell you, if -- if you think that running your economy into the ground and having to send troops in, in order to prop up your only ally is leadership, then we have got a different definition of leadership. My definition of leadership would be leading on climate change, an international accord that potentially we will get in Paris. My definition of leadership is mobilizing the entire world community to make sure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon. And with respect to the Middle East, we have got a 60-country coalition that is not suddenly lining up around Russia's strategy. To the contrary, they are arguing that, in fact, that strategy will not work. My point is -- was not that he was leading; my point is that he was challenging your leadership. And he has very much involved himself in the situation. Can you imagine anything happening in Syria of any significance at all without the Russians now being involved in it and having a part of it? Keep in mind that, for the last five years, the Russians have provided arms, provided financing, as have the Iranians, as has Hezbollah. But they have not been bombing, and they have not had troops on the ground. And the fact that they had to do this is not an indication of strength. You do not think that Mr. Putin would have preferred having Mr. Assad be able to solve this problem without him having to send a bunch of pilots and money that they do not have? Did you know he was going to do all this when you met with him in New York? Yeah, well, we had seen -- we had pretty good intelligence.

You say he is doing this out of weakness. There is a perception in the Middle East among our adversaries, certainly, and even among some of our allies that the United States is in retreat. That we pulled our troops out of Iraq, and ISIS has moved in and taken over much of that territory. The situation in Afghanistan is very precarious, and the Taliban is on the march again. And ISIS controls a large part of Syria. I think it -- I think it is fair to say, ENTITY, that if -- They -- let me just finish the thought. They say your -- they say you are projecting weakness, not a strength. You are - you are saying they, but you are not -- you are not citing too many folks. I'd say the Saudis, I'd say the Israelis.

If you are citing the Republican Party, I think it is fair to say that there is nothing I have done right over the last seven-and-a-half years.

And ENTITY, I guarantee you that there are factions inside of the Middle East, and I guess factions inside the Republican Party, who think that we should send endless numbers of troops into the Middle East. That the only measure of strength is us sending back several hundred thousand troops. That we are going to impose a peace, police the region, and that the fact that we might have more deaths of U.S. troops-- thousands of troops killed, thousands of troops injured, spend another trillion dollars-- they would have no problem with that. There are people who would like to see us do that. And unless we do that, they will suggest we are in retreat. They will say you are throwing in the towel.

But here are the things that we also have to do in order to make sure that America leads and America is strong and stays number one. And if in fact the only measure is for us to send another 100,000 or 200,000 troops into Syria or back into Iraq, or perhaps into Libya, or perhaps into Yemen, and our goal somehow is that we are now going to be not just the police, but the governors of this region. And I think that if we make that mistake again, then shame on us. I think that there are places, obviously, like Syria that are not safer than when I came into office. But in terms of us protecting ourselves against terrorism, in terms of us making sure that we are strengthening our alliances, in terms of our reputation around the world, absolutely we are stronger.

What else you got? ENTITY, there are a lot of serious problems with the world right now, but I want to ask you a few questions about politics. What do you think of Donald Trump? Well, I think that he is a great publicity-seeker, and at a time when the Republican Party has not really figured out what it is for as opposed to what it is against, I think that he is -- he has tapped into something that exists in the Republican Party that is real. I think there is genuine anti-immigrant sentiment in a large portion of at least Republican primary voters. He knows how to get attention. And, at this early stage, it is not surprising that he is gotten a lot of attention. You think he is running out of steam. You know, I will leave it up to the pundits to make that determination. I do not think he will end up being ENTITY of the United States. No. while she was secretary of state? Do you think it posed a national security problem?

And, you know, she made a mistake. She has acknowledged it. I do think that the way it is been ginned-up is, in part, because of politics. And I think she'd be the first to acknowledge that maybe she could have handled the original decision better and the disclosures more quickly. What was your reaction when you found out about it? This is one of those issues that I think is legitimate, but the fact that, for the last three months, this is all that is been spoken about is an indication that we are in presidential political season. Do you agree with what President Clinton has said and -- and Secretary Clinton has said, that this is not that big a deal. Do you agree with that? What I think is that it is important for her to answer these questions to the satisfaction of the American public. And they can make their own judgment. I can tell you that this is not a situation in which America's national security was endangered. This administration has prosecuted people for having classified material on their private computers. Well, I -- there is no doubt that there had been breaches, and these are all a matter of degree. We do not get an impression that here there was purposely efforts in -- to hide something or to squirrel away information. But again, I am going to leave it to -- Okay, if she had come to you -- I am going to leave it to Hillary when she has an interview with you to address all these questions.

I do want to talk a little bit about Congress. Are you going to miss John Boehner? John Boehner and I disagreed on just about everything. But the one thing I will say about John Boehner is he did care about the institution. He recognized that nobody gets a hundred percent in our democracy. I will not say that -- that he and I were ideal partners, but he and I could talk, and we could get some things done. And so, I am a little concerned that the reason he left was because there are a group of members of Congress who think having somebody who is willing to shut down the government or default on the U.S. debt is going to allow them to get their way a hundred percent of the time. Do you think you are going to be able to get anything through Congress? Well, given that this Congress has not been able to get much done at all over the last year-and-a- half, two years-- for that matter, for the last four-- it would be surprising if we were able to make huge strides on the things that are important. But I have a more modest goal, which is to make sure that Congress does not do damage to the economy. ENTITY says that means avoiding another budget crisis and another round of threats to shut down the government, which could happen as early as December. Even with congressional Republicans in disarray, he is hoping to reach a deal with Congress, as he did two years ago, to lift some spending caps in defense and other areas while continuing to reduce the deficit. Right now, our economy is much stronger relative to the rest of the world. China, Europe, emerging markets, they are all having problems. And so, if we provide another shock to the system by shutting down the government, that could mean that the progress we have made starts going backwards instead of forwards. We have to make sure that we pass a transportation bill. It may not be everything that I want. We should be being much more aggressive in rebuilding America right now.

{"id": 2239, "text": "ENTITY, was this the most satisfying week of your ENTITY? Well, it was certainly one of the most satisfying weeks not only for my Presidency, but I think for the United States since I have been ENTITY. Obviously bin Laden had been not only a symbol of terrorism, but a mass murderer who is eluded justice for so long, and so many families who had been affected I think had given up hope. And for us to be able to definitively say, We got the man who caused thousands of deaths here in the United States and who had been the rallying point for a violent extremist jihad around the world was something that I think all of us were profoundly grateful to be a part of. Was the decision to launch this attack the most difficult decision that you have made as Commander-In-Chief? You know, every time I send young men and women into a war theatre, that is a tough decision. And, you know, whenever you go to Walter Reed or Bethesda and you see the price that our young people pay to keep this country safe, that is a tough decision. Whenever you write a letter to a family who is lost a loved one. This was a very difficult decision, in part because the evidence that we had was not absolutely conclusive. Obviously it entailed enormous risk to the guys that I sent in there. But ultimately I had so much confidence in the capacity of our guys to carry out the mission that I felt that the risks were outweighed by the potential benefit of us finally getting our man. When the CIA first brought this information to you . . . Did this look promising from the very beginning? It did look promising from the beginning. Keep in mind that obviously when I was still campaigning for ENTITY, I had said that if I ever get a shot at bin Laden we are gonna take it. And I was subject to some criticism at the time, because I had said if it is in Pakistan and, you know, we do not have the ability to capture 'em in any other way, then we are gonna go ahead and take the shot. So I felt very strongly that there was a strategic imperative for us to go after him. Shortly after I got into office, I brought Leon Panetta privately into the Oval Office and I said to him, We need to redouble our efforts in hunting bin Laden down. And I want us to start putting more resources, more focus, and more urgency into that mission.

{"id": 2240, "text": "They had been working steadily on this since 2001, obviously. And there were a range of threads that were out there that had not quite been pulled all together. They did an incredible job during the course of a year and a half to pull on a number of these threads until we were able to identify a courier who was known to be a bin Laden associate, to be able to track them to this compound. So by the time they came to me they had worked up an image of the compound, where it was and the factors that led them to conclude that this was the best evidence that we had regarding bin Laden's whereabouts since Tora Bora. But we did not have a photograph of bin Laden in that building. And so the CIA continued to build the case meticulously over the course of several months. Even as you guys are building a stronger intelligence case, let us also start building an action plan to figure out if in fact we make a decision that this is him or we have got a good chance that we have got him, how are we gonna deal with him? How can we get at that? And so at that point you probably had unprecedented cooperation between the CIA and our military in starting to shape an action plan that ultimately resulted in success this week. When was that when you set that plan in motion? Well, they first came to me in August of last year with evidence of the compound. And they said that they had more work to do on it, but at that point they had enough that they felt that it was appropriate for us to start doing some planning. And so from that point on we started looking at the time what our options might be. The vigorous planning did not begin until early this year. And obviously over the last two months it is been very intensive in which not only did an action plan get developed, but our guys actually started practicing being able to execute. How actively were you involved in that process? About as active as any project that I have been involved with since I have been ENTITY. Obviously we have extraordinary guys.

I thought it was important, though, for us to be able to say that we'd definitely got the guy. We thought that it was important for us to be able to exploit potential information that was on the ground in the compound if it did turn out to be him. We thought that it was important for us not only to protect the lives of our guys, but also to try to minimize collateral damage in the region because this was in a residential neighborhood. I mean one of the ironies of this is, you know, I think the image that bin Laden had tried to promote was that he was an ascetic, living in a cave. This guy was living in a million dollar compound in a residential neighborhood. Were you surprised when they came to you with this compound right in the middle of sort of the military center of Pakistan? Well, I think that there had been discussions that this guy might be hiding in plain sight. And we knew that some al Qaeda operatives, high level targets basically, just blended into the crowd like this. I think we were surprised when we learned that this compound had been there for five or six years, and that it was in an area in which you would think that potentially he would attract some attention. So yes, the answer is that we were surprised that he could maintain a compound like that for that long without there being a tip off. Do you believe it was built for him? We are still investigating that, but what is clear is that the elements of the compound were structured so that nobody could see in. There were no sight lines that would enable somebody walking by or somebody in an adjoining building to see him. So it was clearly designed to make sure that bin Laden was protected from public view. Do you have any idea how long he was there? Did he move out of that compound? That we do not know yet. But we know that for five to six years this compound was there, and our belief is that he was there during that time. What was the most difficult part of that decision?

So my biggest concern was, if I am sending those guys in and Murphy's Law applies and something happens, can we still get our guys out? Point number two, these guys are going in, you know, the darkest of night. And they do not know what they are gonna find there. They do not know if, you know, there are explosives that are triggered by a particular door opening. So huge risks that these guys are taking. if I send them in, can I get them out? And a lot of the discussion we had during the course of planning was how do we make sure there is backup? How do we make sure that there is redundancy built into the plan so that we have the best chance of getting our guys out? as outstanding a job as our intelligence teams did -- and I cannot praise them enough they did an extraordinary job with just the slenderest of bits of information to piece this all together -- at the end of the day, this was still a 55/45 situation. Obviously, we are going into the sovereign territory of another country and landing helicopters and conducting a military operation. And so if it turns out that it is a wealthy, you know, prince from Dubai who is in this compound, and, you know, we have spent Special Forces in -- we have got problems. The fact that our Special Forces have become so good -- these guys perform at levels that 20, 30 years ago would not have happened -- I think finally gave me the confidence to say, Let us go ahead. I think that the American people have some sense of how good these guys are, but until you actually see 'em and meet them, it is hard to describe how courageous, how tough, how skilled, how precise they are. And it was because of their skills that I ended up having confidence to make the decision. I mean it is been reported that there was some resistance from advisors and planners who disagreed with the commando raid approach. Was it difficult for you to overcome that? And what level of confidence did you have? You know one of the things that we have done here is to build a team that is collegial and where everybody speaks their mind.

But as I said, you know, there were sufficient risks involved where it was not as if any of the folks who were voicing doubts were voicing something that I was not already running through in my own head. You know, we understood that there were some significant risks involved in this. How much did some of the past failures, like the Iran hostage rescue attempt, how did that weigh on you? I thought about that. No, I mean you think about Black Hawk Down. You think about what happened with the Iranian rescue. And it, you know, I am very sympathetic to the situation for other Presidents where you make a decision, you are making your best call, your best shot, and something goes wrong -- because these are tough, complicated operations. The day before I was thinkin' about this quite a bit. It sounds like you made a decision that you could accept failure. You did not want failure but after looking at . . . the 55/45 thing that you mentioned, you must have at some point concluded that the advantages outweighed the risks . . . . And the reason that I concluded it was worth it was that we have devoted enormous blood and treasure in fighting back against al Qaeda. And so part of what was in my mind was all those young men that I visited who are still fighting in Afghanistan. And the families of victims of terrorism that I talk to. And I said to myself that if we have a good chance of not completely defeating but badly disabling al Qaeda, then it was worth both the political risks as well as the risks to our men. How much of it was gut instinct? Did you have personal feelings about whether . . . . The thing about gut instinct is if it works, then you think, Boy, I had good instincts. If it does not , then you are gonna be running back in your mind all the things that told you maybe you should not have done it.

So this was in the back of my mind all weekend. Was it hard keeping your focus? Did you have to suppress the urge to tell someone? Did you wanna tell somebody? Did you wanna tell Michelle? Did you tell Michelle? You know one of the great successes of this operation was that we were able to keep this thing secret. And it is a testimony to how seriously everybody took this operation and the understanding that any leak could end up not only compromising the mission, but killing some of the guys that we were sending in there. And so very few people in the White House knew. The vast majority of my most senior aides did not know that we were doing this.

Well, it did not go exactly according to planned, but this is exactly where all the work that had been done anticipating what might go wrong made a huge difference. You had to blow up some walls? We had to blow up some walls. When was the first indication you got that you had found the right place? There was a point before folks had left, before we had gotten everybody back on the helicopter and were flying back to base, where they said Geronimo has been killed. And Geronimo was the code name for bin Laden. And now obviously at that point these guys were operating in the dark with all kinds of stuff going on so everybody was cautious. What was your reaction when you heard those words? I was relieved and I wanted to make sure those guys got over the Pakistan border and landed safely. And I think deeply proud and deeply satisfied of my team. When they landed we had very strong confirmation at that point that it was him. Facial analysis indicated that in fact it was him. We had not yet done DNA testing, but at that point we were 95 percent sure. Did you see the pictures? What was your reaction when you saw them? Why have not you released them? You know, we discussed this internally. Keep in mind that we are absolutely certain this was him. We have done DNA sampling and testing. And so there is no doubt that we killed Osama bin Laden. It is important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence. You know, we do not trot out this stuff as trophies. You know, the fact of the matter is this was somebody who was deserving of the justice that he received. And I think Americans and people around the world are glad that he is gone. But we do not need to spike the football.

There are gonna be some folks who deny it . The fact of the matter is, you will not see bin Laden walking on this earth again. Was it your decision to bury him at sea? We thought it was important to think through ahead of time how we would dispose of the body if he were killed in the compound. And I think that what we tried to do was, consulting with experts in Islamic law and ritual, to find something that was appropriate that was respectful of the body. Frankly we took more care on this than, obviously, bin Laden took when he killed 3,000 people. He did not have much regard for how they were treated and desecrated. And I think we handled it appropriately. and you walked out of the situation room . . . . what did you do? Yeah, I think I walked up with my team, and I just said, We got him. And I expressed my profound gratitude and pride to the team that had worked on this. I mean keep in mind this is something, first of all, that that was not just our doing. Obviously since 2001, countless folks in our intelligence community and our military had worked on this issue. President Bush had obviously devoted a lot of resources to this, and so there was a cumulative effort and a testament to the capacity of the United States of America to follow through. And to do what we said we are gonna do. Even across administrations, across party lines and the skill with which our intelligence and military folks operated in this was indescribable. So it was a moment of great pride for me to see our capacity as a nation to execute something this difficult this well. And obviously, it also made me think about those families that I had met previously who had been so profoundly burdened by the fact that he was still running around out there. You know, I got a letter the day after, an e-mail from a young person who had spoken to her dad when she was four years old before the towers collapsed, he was he was in the building.

When you announced that bin Laden had been killed last Sunday, you said Our counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden in the compound where he was hiding. Can you be more specific on that, and how much help did Pakistan actually provide in getting rid of bin Laden. You know, I have gotta be careful about sources and methods and how we operate and how we pieced together this intelligence, because we are gonna still be going after terrorists in the future. What I can say is that Pakistan, since 9/11, has been a strong counterterrorism partner with us. There have been times where we have had disagreements. There have been times where we wanted to push harder, and for various concerns, they might have hesitated. But the fact of the matter is, is that we have been able to kill more terrorists on Pakistani soil than just about any place else. We could not have done that without Pakistani cooperation. And I think that this will be an important moment in which Pakistan and the United States gets together and says, All right, we have gotten bin Laden, but we have got more work to do. And are there ways for us to work more effectively together than we have in the past? And that is gonna be important for our national security. It does not mean that there are not gonna be times where we are gonna be frustrated with Pakistanis. And frankly, there are gonna be times where they are frustrated with us. You know, they have got not only individual terrorists there, but there is also a climate inside of Pakistan that sometimes is deeply anti-American. But I do think that it is important for the American people to understand that we have got a stake in continuing cooperation from Pakistan on these issues. You did not tell anybody in the Pakistani government or the military. As I said, I did not tell most people here in the White House. I did not tell my own family. It was that important for us to maintain operational security. But you were carrying out this operation in Pakistan. You did not trust 'em? If I am not revealing to some of my closest aides what we are doing, then I sure as heck am not gonna be revealing it to folks who I do not know.

And we have already communicated to them, and they have indicated they have a profound interest in finding out what kinds of support networks bin Laden might have had. But these are questions that we are not gonna be able to answer three or four days after the event. It is gonna take some time for us to be able to exploit the intelligence that we were able to gather on site. And I just want the American people to think about this. These guys, our guys, go in in the dead of night, it is pitch black, they are taking out walls, false doors, getting shot at, they killed bin Laden, and they had the presence of mind to still gather up a whole bunch of bin Laden's material which will be a treasure trove of information that could serve us very well in the weeks and months to come. It is just an indication of the extraordinary work that they did. Do you have any sense of what they found there? We are now obviously putting everything we have got into analyzing and evaluating all that information. But we anticipate that it can give us leads to other terrorists that we have been looking for for a long time, other high value targets. But also can give us a better sense of existing plots that might have been there how they operated and their methods of communicating. All of this should help us continue to push harder and harder. And one of the things that I said when I came into office was we had to remember what our primary focus was. Who carried out September 11th and how do we make sure that we are laser-focused on getting them. We have done a great job even before we got bin Laden in degrading their capacity. And we now have the opportunity, we are not done yet, but we have got the opportunity, I think, to really finally defeat at least Al Qaeda in that border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Although his name was not on the ballot, his performance in office was certainly a factor in the outcome. Late on Thursday afternoon, two years to the date after his election as the 44th , we sat down with him in the Oval Office and the mood was different. We talked about Tuesday's vote, the economy, and where he goes from here. The Republicans have said this was a referendum on you and the Democratic Party. Do you agree with that? I think, first and foremost, it was a referendum on the economy, and the party in power was held responsible for an economy that is still underperforming and where a lot of folks are still hurting. At your news conference you seemed unwilling to accept the idea that this was a rejection, in any way, of your agenda and your policies. Is this defeat a reflection on your leadership? I think that what happened over the course of two years was that we had to take a series of big emergency steps quickly, and most of them in the first six months of my administration. Each of them had a big price tag, and people looked at that and they said, Boy, this feels as if there is a huge expansion of government. Well, it was a huge expansion of government. What I did not effectively, I think, drive home is that we were taking these steps not because of some theory that we wanted to expand government; it was because we had an emergency situation and we wanted to make sure the economy did not go off a cliff.

A lot of the people that helped elect you two years ago voted for Republicans -- women, senior citizens, independents; young people and African- Americans did not turn out in large numbers. How do you explain that? Well, as I said, I think that folks are frustrated with what they have seen over the last two years.

You have mentioned a couple of times the emergency that you faced when you came into office, and you have mentioned continually the unemployment problem and the economy. Not for the people who are out of work. I think that the way to think about it is the dangers of a second Big Recession are now much reduced; the danger of us tipping into a Great Depression, I think most economists would say, is not -- is not out there on the horizon. What is a danger is that we stay stuck in a new normal, where unemployment rates stay high. People who have jobs see their incomes go up, businesses make big profits; but they have learned to do more with less, and so they do not hire. And as a consequence, we keep on seeing growth that is just too slow to bring back the 8 million jobs that were lost. So that is something that I spend a lot of time thinking about. You know, one of the things I think you understand, as , is you are held responsible for everything, but you do not always have control over everything; and especially in an economy this big, there are limited tools to encourage the kind of job growth that we need. I am constantly reminded that we have been through worse times than these and we have always come out on top. You spent nearly a trillion dollars on the stimulus package; you have got short -- short-term interest rates are zero -- practically zero, and still the unemployment rate is 9.6 percent. What can you do to create jobs that has not already been done? Some of this is going to be just a matter of the economy healing. There are some things we can do to accelerate growth. We still -- we have got a couple of trillion dollars worth of infrastructure improvements that need to be made around the country. I mean, there are construction crews all across the country that are dying for work, and companies that are willing to take a very small profit to get work done.

We have got to try to make good decisions based on the facts, in order to put people back to work, to get credit flowing again. And I am not going to be distracted by what is happening day to day. Well, I think that as a general proposition, you do not want to be passing laws that are just targeting a handful of individuals. You want to pass laws that have some broad applicability. And as a general proposition, I think you certainly do not want to use the tax code to punish people. I think that you have got a pretty egregious situation here that people are understandably upset about. And so let us see if there are ways of doing this that are both legal, that are constitutional that uphold our basic principles of fairness, but do not hamper us from getting the banking system back on track. You have got a piece of legislation that could affect tens of thousands of people. Some of these people probably had nothing to do with the financial crisis. And some of them probably deserve the bonuses that they got. Well, that is why we are going to have to take a look at this legislation carefully. Clearly the AIG folks getting those bonuses did not make sense. And one of the things that I have to do is to communicate to Wall Street that, given the current crisis that we are in, they cannot expect help from taxpayers but they enjoy all the benefits that they enjoyed before the crisis happened. You get a sense that, in some institutions that has not sunk in. That you cannot go back to the old way of doing business, certainly not on the taxpayers' dime. And we do not want to cut off our nose to spite our face. Your Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has been under a lot of pressure this week.

I do not want to go through some of the scrutiny, embarrassment, in addition to taking huge cuts in pay. Have you offered some of these high level positions the Treasury to people who would have turned them down? Your Treasury Secretary's plan... Geithner's plan, and -- your plan really -- for solving the banking crisis -- was met with very, very, very tepid response. And you had a lot of people criticize... a lot of people said they did not understand it. A lot of people said it did not have any -- enough details to solve the problem. I know you are coming out with something next week on this. But these criticisms were coming from people like Warren Buffett, people who had supported you, and you had counted as being your...

Because I think we did learn lessons from the Great Depression. Is there some limit to the amount of money we can spend? And are we getting close to it? The limit is our ability to finance these expenditures through borrowing. And, you know, the United States is fortunate that it has the largest, most stable economic and political system around.

If we do not get a handle on this, and also start looking at our long-term deficit projections, at a certain point people will stop buying those Treasury Bills.

This should not come as news to anybody given its history. We need to be careful what we are getting ourselves into in Afghanistan. Because we have come to be looked upon there by people in Afghanistan, and even people now in Pakistan. As another foreign power coming in, trying to take over the region. I am very mindful of that. Afghanistan is not going to be easy in many ways. This is the assessment of commanders on the ground. Is Iraq was actually easier than Afghanistan. You have got a much better educated population, infrastructure to build off of. You do not have some of the same destabilizing border issues that you have between Afghanistan and Pakistan. But it is not acceptable for us to simply sit back and let safe havens of terrorists plan and plot I am sure you want to answer this. A week ago Vice President Cheney-- said essentially that your willingness to shut down Guantanamo and to change the way prisoners are treated and interrogator -- interrogated -- was making America weaker and more vulnerable to another attack. And that the interrogation techniques that were used at Guantanamo were essential in preventing another attack against the United States. I fundamentally disagree with Dick Cheney. You know, I think that Vice President Cheney has been at the head of a movement whose notion is somehow that we cannot reconcile our core values, our Constitution, our belief that we do not torture, with our national security interests. I think he is drawing the wrong lesson from history. The facts do not bear him out. I think he is -- that attitude, that philosophy has done incredible damage to our image and position in the world. I mean, the fact of the matter is after all these years how many convictions actually came out of Guantanamo? How many terrorists have actually been brought to justice under the philosophy that is being promoted by Vice President Cheney? What it has been is a great advertisement for anti-American sentiment.

I fundamentally disagree with that. Now do these folks deserve Miranda rights? Do they deserve to be treated like a shoplifter down the block? What do you do with those people?

Our economy is in a transition of the sort that America's gone through maybe every 70-75 years. We went from an agriculture economy to an information, to an industrial economy during Teddy Roosevelt's period. We have now gone from an industrial to a knowledge-based, innovation society. And, you know, there are a lot of disruptions. And the middle class in America has really taken it on the chin, during this period. You know, women went into the workforce to try to keep family incomes up. But then that was not enough; they ended up getting into debt. And they are not seeing enough prospects for a future where their kids are gonna do better than they are. Now the good news is, we can solve these problems and meet these challenges, because America, by definition, is an innovation society. We constantly remake ourselves. So there is no reason why we should not succeed in this era, just like we have succeeded in past eras. But it requires us to make some adjustments. And it requires everybody to have a fair chance, everybody to do their fair share, and rules of the road that create fair play for everybody. And what people have been frustrated about, especially since the financial crisis, is the sense that the rules are rigged against middle-class families and those aspiring to get in the middle class. So, if we are willing to make investments in education so that everybody gets a fair chance and kids are not coming out with $100,000 worth of debt to go to college. If we make sure that everybody's doing their fair share, to pay for things like infrastructure improvements in basic science and research and advanced manufacturing and innovation, we ask those who've benefited the most over the last three decades, we ask them to do a little bit more. And if we have got tough rules of the road -- like the financial reform package that we passed into law last year -- there is no reason why over the next five, ten years, we cannot reposition ourselves so that every single American, no matter what they look like, no matter where they come from, they can succeed.

Well, I think that when I came into office in 2008, it was my firm belief that at such an important moment in our history, there was no reason why Democrats and Republicans could not put some of the old ideological baggage aside and focus on common sense, what works, practical solutions to the tough problems we were facing. And I think the Republicans made a different calculation, which was, You know what? We really screwed up the economy. Our best bet is to stand on the sidelines, because we think the economy's gonna get worse, and at some point, just blame him. And so we have not gotten the kind of engagement from them that I would have liked. And the best example of this was when we were negotiating around reducing the deficit. The truth is that, compared to other countries around the world, our deficit problems are completely manageable. If we had a balanced package that reforms some of our health care programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, that cuts discretionary spending, which I have already agreed to do - and we have cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending so far, and I am willing to do more. And I have put forward specific plans to do more. And we ended up asking the wealthiest Americans to do a little bit more in terms of taxes. Going back to rates that would still be lower than they were under Ronald Reagan, our deficit problems would be solved. We are gonna put country ahead of party. Now what I have said to them is, That deal remains on the table. My offer to cooperate on a whole range of issues remains on the table. They need help right now. And so what we have done, since this debt ceiling debacle, is to look at every single thing I can do through executive actions to go ahead and help provide some relief to middle-class families.

And traditionally, Republicans have tried to claim the mantle of being in favor of every tax cut. They never want to raise taxes. And yet, we have the prospect in 20-some days that 160 million Americans will see their taxes go up by an average of a thousand bucks. And yet, it is become a negotiation, where they think that in order for us to do something that is common sense and needed for our economy, that somehow they are doing me a favor. This is not something you do for me. We even had a Republican quoted in the newspapers yesterday, saying that If we load up a whole bunch of additional stuff that ENTITY does not like, then maybe we'd pass the payroll tax -- and the more ENTITY does not like it, the more I like it. That attitude just drives people crazy. Have you given up on the Republicans? Have you stopped reaching out to them? Are you just out there now trying to get your message across? Every opportunity that I see for us to be able to actually get something done, I will seize. So we passed three trade agreements that the Republicans agreed to.

They say it is your insistence on raising the taxes to the wealthiest Americans, that you are fixated on that. You cannot lower rates and raise revenue, unless you are getting revenue from someplace else. Now, either it is coming from middle-class families or poor families or it is coming from folks like you and me that can afford to pay a little more. I mean, I think the average American understands that. The argument has been that if you reform the deduction process... The deductions mean home mortgages for middle-class families. The deductions mean things that a lot of people of modest means rely on. Now we can have a discussion about potentially reforming some of those deductions, but you cannot get away from the basic concept that either we have a system in which the people who have benefited the most from this new economy -- by a magnitude of 200%-300% increases in their income. Either they are doing a little bit more or they are not. And this is not because I am interested in punishing the rich.

These are long-term programs that we need to fix. We need to make sure that they are sustainable for the future so that the next generation of seniors have them. But in order to do that, we have got to start reducing health care costs. And I took a lot of heat for it. We have not seen the equivalent willingness on the other side. If there is a serious proposal out there that is balanced, I want to seize it. And I am ready tomorrow to sign a bill that is balanced. Look, you gave up a lot. You said you wanted a balanced approach. You did not get it. You cut a trillion dollars and set up the framework to cut another trillion plus and the Republicans gave up nothing. I mean, there are people in your own party who think that you were outmaneuvered. That you were stared down by John Boehner and Grover Norquist and capitulated. Now you are saying I gave up too much. It seems to be all the compromising is being done by you. So I think what you will see is that we were willing to make some tough cuts on programs, some of which I like and would like to see in place. But we cannot afford them right now. So yes, we made some tough cuts. But that trillion dollars' worth of cuts were cuts that we had helped identify, that we were willing and prepared to make anyway. And we did so partly because we think it is important to send a strong signal that we are serious about deficit reduction.

And I say that not because of personal ambition, it is because I think that this country has to move in a direction that builds from the bottom up, an economy where everybody has a chance to succeed. And the only way we are gonna do that is to improve our education system, make investments in infrastructure, roads, bridges, broadband lines, basic research, increase the number of engineers we have got, number of scientists that we have, encourage entrepreneurship -- all the things that I have been talking about over the last several years. And what we are not gonna succeed in doing is somehow creating a you are -on-your-own economy, in which just a handful of people are succeeding and the expectation is somehow those benefits are gonna trickle down to everybody.

We have done that on things like education reform. And it is my job to rally the American people around that vision. And on all three fronts, we have been able to do that. If I cannot get Republicans to move, partly because they have made a political, strategic decision that says, Anything ENTITY's for, we are against, because that is our best chance of winning an election, I do not think the American people would see that as a failure on my part. My preference is that they'd have a different attitude. You know, I have been joking with my staff lately that I think in my next speech, I am gonna say, I am adamantly opposed to investing in education and putting teachers in the classroom. I am adamantly opposed to rebuilding America and putting construction workers back to work. And I am thinking maybe suddenly Republicans might be for it. But, you know, keep in mind, I am talking about Republican members of Congress. I am not talking about Republicans around the country. They do not like you much better. But I think that they like the ideas that we put forward. I mean, the interesting thing is the majority of Republicans actually think we should have a balanced approach to deficit reduction, including tax increases for the wealthy. The majority of Republicans do think that we should make investments in roads and bridges and improving our airports and investing in basic research and medical research. So if you take my name out of it and just look at the ideas that we have been presenting, these are common sense, mainstream ideas that Republican presidents in the past have supported.

So all I can worry about is making sure that every single day, the steps I am taking, I believe, are advancing an agenda that leads to America's success over the long term. And until you actually see results, people are gonna continue to be frustrated. With the unemployment at 8.6 , you still got soft consumer demand. You have got no business investment, there is still a fairly steady downturn in housing prices. Do you know something that these 29% do not know? I mean, do you see some hope? Do you think that you might have the unemployment rate down to 8% by the time the election rolls around? But, you know, I am not in the job of prognosticating on the economy. I am in the job of putting in place the tools that allow the economy to thrive and Americans to succeed. And keep in mind that when I came into office, it turns out that in the three months before I was sworn in, the economy had contracted by 9%. We lost four million jobs before I was sworn in and another four million jobs in three months after I was sworn in, but before any of our economic policies had a chance to take effect. And we have now had nine consecutive quarters, two and a half years, in which the economy's grown. About nine months later, we were creating jobs again. And we have had 21 consecutive months of private sector job growth. You know, we did all the right things to prevent a great depression and to get the economy growing again and to get job creation going again. But it has not made up for the hole that was created in those six, nine, 12 months before my economic policies took effect.

First of all, there is not general perception that the stimulus did not work. You have got John McCain's former economist and a whole series of prominent economists, who say that it created or saved three millions jobs and prevented us from going into a great depression. It is true that some people have argued, given the magnitude of the crisis we were in, we should have done an even larger Recovery Act. And then I am bumping up against the realities of Congress, which is this Recovery Act was twice as large as most people thought was even possible. And yet, because the problem was so big, you can make an argument that it might have been larger. There are some people who argue, Well, you could have done a different mix. Well, a third of this was tax cuts to the American people, putting more money into their pockets.

So we made the right moves, even when they were politically difficult. Our intervention in the auto industry probably saved about a million jobs. And, by the way, taxpayers have been paid back a big chunk of the money, much faster than anybody anticipated. And we are now competing with other automakers from other countries in ways that we had not seen before. And the recurring challenge here, ENTITY, is always gonna be, even if we have done the right things, if people's reality right now is still difficult, they are gonna be frustrated. And they hold you equally accountable with the Congress. And the question next year is gonna be -- and this is how democracy's supposed to work -- do they see a more compelling vision coming out from the other side? Do they think that cutting taxes further, including on the wealthy, cutting taxes on corporations, gutting regulations. You know, rolling back clean air and clean water laws? And if the American people think that that is a recipe for success and a majority are persuaded by that, then I am gonna lose.

One of the things that surprised me the most about this poll is that 42%, when asked who your policies favor the most, 42% said Wall Street. Only 35% said average Americans. My suspicion is some of that may have to do with the fact that there is not been any prosecutions, criminal prosecutions, of people on Wall Street. And that the civil charges that have been brought have often resulted in what many people think have been slap on the wrists, fines. Cost of doing business, I think you called it in the Kansas speech. Are you disappointed by that? Well, I think you are absolutely right in your interpretation. And, you know, I cannot , as ENTITY of the United States, comment on the decisions about particular prosecutions. That is the job of the Justice Department. And we keep those things separate, so that there is no political influence on decisions made by professional prosecutors. I can tell you, just from 40,000 feet, that some of the most damaging behavior on Wall Street, in some cases, some of the least ethical behavior on Wall Street, was not illegal. That is exactly why we had to change the laws. And that is why we put in place the toughest financial reform package since F.D.R. and the Great Depression.

One of the things I am proud about is that I think my basic character and outlook actually have not changed much. And people who are closest to me will tell you that the guy who came here is the same guy who is leaving. And the reason I take pride for that is one of the things you worry about when you are in the bubble, and there is all this pomp and circumstance and hail to the chief is, do you lose touch with what you thought was important and what brought you here?

Your only executive experience was running the Harvard Law Review and running your own campaign. Did you have to learn a lot of this on the job? The campaign was a more significant training ground than I think people give it credit for. By the time I got here, I think I had a pretty good sense of what was required.

I did not expect, particularly in the midst of crisis, just how severe that partisanship would be. You came into this office trying to unify the country. You said that many times during the campaign. You wanted to bring people together. You wanted to change Washington. You talked about transformative change. And you became the focal point for some of the division. I became a lightning rod for some partisan battles. I could not be prouder of the track record we have put together. By almost every measure, the country is significantly better off than when I came in. Our kids' education is better, if you can say that you have made things better, then considering all the challenges out there, you should feel good. But I am the first to acknowledge that I did not crack the code in terms of reducing this partisan fever. You did not change Washington. You know, I changed those things that were in direct-- my direct control.

Part of the job description is also shaping public opinion. And we were very effective, and I was very effective, in shaping public opinion around my campaigns.

That you have let other people define you, that you haven`t sold your successes well enough? I think it`s a fair argument, you know, I think that over the course of two years we were so busy and so focused on getting a bunch of stuff done that we stopped paying attention to the fact that, you know leadership is not just legislation, that it is a matter of persuading people and giving them confidence, and bringing them together and setting a tone. Donald Trump, if you take away the particulars, was elected to the office, basically, on the same program that you were, of change. He wants to change Washington. Well, I mean that is a lot of particulars you are taking away. Do you think anybody can change Washington? I think the American people can change Washington. But I think that it is not going to change, because somebody from on high directs that change. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, are motivated by all kinds of issues. They are sincerely interested in the economy, in terrorism, in social issues. And if they think that it is harder for them to get reelected by cooperating with each other, then they will not cooperate. A lot of people think the system is broken, that the system, the political system is broken. That seemed to be the message that you heard throughout this campaign. And you seem to be saying, in some ways, maybe it is broken. In the first two years, when I had a strong majority in the House and the Senate, we were as productive as any administration has been since the '60s. And so you can get a lot of stuff done through this system. But to sustain a governing majority, that requires an ability for Republicans and Democrats to find some common ground.

Look, I think it is stable, because the framers, in their wisdom, designed the system so that power's pretty disbursed. You know, we have states. And we have cities. And we have counties. And we have the private sector. But the problem is that, over time, big pieces of business that have to get done without leadership from Washington, do not get done. I want to go back just briefly on this. But I think, look, this last election, you had a political system. Well, first of all the people elected somebody who went around saying that the system was rigged. You had two of the most unpopular presidential candidates selected by the two parties in history. It indicates that there is a lot of cynicism out there. It indicates that the corrosive nature of everything from talk radio to fake news to negative advertising has made people lack confidence in a lot of our existing institutions. I think it indicates, at least on the Democratic side, that we have got more work to do to strengthen our grassroots networks. In some ways, the Democratic Party had not constructed itself to get that message out to the places it needed to get to. The Tea Party I have huge disagreements with, obviously. But I give them credit for having activated themselves. And they made a difference in terms of moving the Republican Party, in terms of moving the country in a particular direction. But it showed that, in fact, you get involved, if your voice is heard it has an impact. Do you feel the same way about Donald Trump? Well I think that he clearly was able to tap into a lot of grievances.

Not yet, but, you know, again, he has not gotten sworn into office yet. You have to admit that this is one of the strangest transitions in history.

{"id": 2293, "text": "Let me dive right in and talk about this issue of tax inversion, this issue of American companies going overseas to reduce their U.S. tax bill or get rid of it. I take it you are not calling it illegal. What I am saying is that companies thrive in the United States in part because they benefit from the best university system in the world, the best infrastructure -- although I'd like to see us do a little better on infrastructure. You know, there are a whole range of benefits that have helped to build companies, create value, create profits. For you to continue to benefit from that entire architecture that helps you thrive, but move your technical address simply to avoid paying taxes, is neither fair nor is it something that is going to be good for the country over the long term. And this is basically taking advantage of tax provisions that are technically legal , but I think most people would say if you are doing business here, if you are basically still an American company, but you are simply changing your mailing address in order to avoid paying taxes, then you are really not doing right by the country and by the American people. Some people would respond that, you know what, these guys are hired to maximize profit. And they are doing basically what they were hired to do. And in fact, it is plenty American for them to try to make as much profit as they can, hire as many people as they can as a result. Well, keep in mind that what we are trying to do is to say that if you simply acquire a small company in Ireland or some other country to take advantage of the low tax rate, you start saying we are now magically an Irish company, despite the fact that you may only have a hundred employees there And you have got 10,000 employees in the United States. You are just gaming the system. You continue to benefit in all kinds a ways from being an American company. It is true that, you know, there are a lot of things that may be legal that probably are not the right thing to do by the country. People are paid to maximize profits.

Your critics suggest that you have not put the presidential muscle behind this issue, certainly the way you did health care or the way you did stimulus early on in your presidency. Well, we reached out repeatedly to both Democrats and Republicans. If we lower corporate tax rates and close loopholes, there is going to be more certainty in terms of what corporations pay. They will benefit from a lower but more certain tax rate. It also allows us then to close some of the loopholes that permit companies to artificially shift profits overseas so they are avoiding tax compliance. It would allow us potentially to have companies who have profits overseas to start bringing some of those profits back and reinvesting in the United States. So there is a whole bunch of good reasons why we should do it. I will be honest with you ENTITY. And they have trouble getting stuff done right now even when they say they want to do something. And I have said to the speaker, I have said to Majority Leader Reid, that we are prepared and we have put forward very specific proposals in terms of how we can get this done. Invariably, it takes some time to work through a big tax reform piece of legislation. When Ronald Reagan last did it back in '86, '87, it was about a year-and-a-half-long process. And I think that the people should expect that this administration will be foursquare behind it as long as the goal of tax reform is to simplify the system, make it fair, as opposed to simply slashing corporate rates while maintaining a bunch of loopholes that are not productive and are not creating jobs and value here in America. Well, let us move from talking about the guys in the C suites to average Americans here. What will you tell average American viewer about the outlook for the economy? Your former economic advisor, Larry Summers says we may be in for a period here in America of lower growth for a protracted period of time. Do you believe in that forecast? And are you concerned that that means we are not going to be able to meet the entitlement promises that we have made without cutting those entitlements and/or raising taxes? You know, I am always bullish about America over the long term.

We remain the most dynamic, innovative economy in the world. We have this huge comparative advantage when it comes to energy. We are now producing more oil than we import, first time in a couple of decades, even as we are massively increasing clean energy. And when it comes to deficits, we have cut them by more than half. And when it comes to health care, we are slowing the growth of health care inflation to the lowest levels in 50 years. So there are a lot of things there that I will - that give me confidence we are poised to take off. But there are some things that are holding us back. The main thing that is holding us back is inaction by our federal government on things like infrastructure, on raising the minimum wage, on doing some things that would help middle-class families feel a little bit of relief. If we do those things, then we are going to be in pretty good shape. It is true, coming out of a financial crisis - historically, when you look at worldwide trends, it is hard when you have a big financial crisis that precipitates a recession. The good news is, because of the resilience of the American people, but also in part because of some good policies and quick action on our part, we have recovered faster and stronger than most counterparts around the world. I can confirm most of your data as the economics reporter for CNBC. And I think you have heard me on the stump talk about this is the source of anxiety for the American people. Now these are 20-, 30-year trends that we have been seeing, a larger and larger portion of increased productivity and increased profits accruing to the very top of the economic pyramid, and the vast majority of middle class folks and folks who are trying to work in the middle class, not seeing higher incomes, higher wages. There are policies we can put in place that can help that. Some of it has to do with globalization. Some of it has to do with technology. Some of it has to do with what some have called a shift to a more winner-take-all economy, because capital's mobile and workers are not and they have less leverage.

Historically, when the middle class is doing well and people are rising in the middle class, lo and behold, business does well also. You talked about the stock market earlier. It is now at near-record levels almost every day. Are you concerned there is a bubble out there like we had in '01 and '08? Well, you know, I try to avoid commenting on the day-to-day trends in the stock market. I think what is true is that the Federal Reserve has properly focused on the need for us to bring unemployment down. The cost of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, as well as unemployment for young people just getting started in their careers, that is something that has devastating effects on the economy for generations, or for decades to come. So I think Janet Yellen has said this is a focus of ours right now. What that does mean is when you have got low interest rates that there is a lot of money looking for returns. And that is probably boosted the stock market significantly. My estimation is that, you know, you have got a lot of savvy investors out there. You have got people who recognize that what goes up can come down as well. I will leave it up to them to make determinations about whether valuations and stock prices are too high. I am more concerned about the day-to-day fundamentals. And if we get those fundamentals right, then I am pretty confident that we can do very well in the next decade. You have said a bunch of times that getting the wealthy to pay a little bit more. And you have succeeded in raising that top tax rate to 39 percent, or rolling back the tax cuts. Is there a limit to how much you believe the government should take from an individual in terms of a top tax rate? You know, I do not have a particular number in mind, but if you look at our history, we are still well below what, you know, the marginal tax rates were under Dwight Eisenhower or, you know, all the way up even through Ronald Reagan.

I have talked about this before. You know, I have got friends of mine who are hedge-fund managers, and they do not always like to hear it, but some, I think, will readily acknowledge if you are making a billion dollars a year and you are paying 15 percent on that billion dollars when your secretary's paying 20 percent, 23 percent, you know, that is not fair. And if we close some of those loopholes, not just carried interest but a range that we know are not economically productive, then sure, some folks do not get to take advantage of stuff they should've been taking advantage of anyway. But that also means we can finance government, keep our deficits under control, and invest in the things that we need to grow over the long term. There is no doubt that the economies of Russia and Europe have intertwined, primarily around the energy sector. And it makes some Europeans more concerned about a robust response to the violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity that Russia's been conducting when it comes to Ukraine. The good news is that, despite some of those commercial concerns, we have seen Europe move with us - not always as fast as we'd like, but they get there. And sadly, tragically, the shooting down of this Malaysian Airlines airliner and the recognition that it is likely it was shot down and it is also likely that it was conducted by non-state actors that were provided incredibly powerful weapons by the Russian government - all that, I think, may stiffen the spine of my European partners moving forward. I want to ask you about Israel. What do you make of these - the FAA banning these flights and then lifting it? Do you think it is safe for Americans to fly to Israel? You know, we have not made decisions when it comes to airline safety based on not just politics, but even our strong alliance with Israel. We have to just look at the facts. The initial ban that was imposed by the FAA was based on Israel needing to show us that, in fact, it was safe for commercial airlines to fly in. They worked through a checklist of concerns and mitigation measures that needed to be taken.

It is good for the American agricultural worker. When I go to the peace conference in Madrid, I happen to think that it is in the national interest to try to help bring peace to that troubled corner of the world. When we stand up against Saddam Hussein's aggression and beat back that, I think it is in the American interest. When I go to the Soviet Union and work with Yeltsin and Gorbachev in turning over that whole system, helping them now move down democracy's road, that is in our pure economic interest. And when I am going to go to Japan, it will be in the same thing. We have got to open up those markets. So, I think there is a frustration on the part of the Democrats, some of them that make these silly charges because they do not put it in the perspective of a global economy. We are in a small world. And thank God we have the exports we have got, or you'd have much tougher economic times right here in this State that is hurting. That is the way I'd respond to it.

There seems to be some bickering today between Democrats and Republicans in Washington; some of the Democrats saying that it is going to lead to a tax increase. We just got a breakthrough on that a few minutes ago. And I talked to Bob Dole, Bob Michel, thanked them; thanked Speaker Foley, the leader of the Democrats in the House; Chairman Rostenkowski, the Democratic leader of the Ways and Means because we have come to agreement now in a way that operates within the budget agreement and, thus, will not raise people's taxes. My argument with the unemployment bill that was passed before is they just wanted to bust the budget agreement, just added to the burden for the 94 percent of the people who are working. And so we finally prevailed on this, provided the Senate votes for it. So, I think there is good news there on the economic front, certainly on the front for those who should have been getting these checks long ago. We want to help people that are hurting, whose benefits have run out. But it is ENTITY that has to protect all the people. And that is what I think we have done now. Let us turn to the ENTITY issue. Why do not we have a national ENTITY bill? What would an ENTITY bill do? Well, I do not know, I am asking you. Well, if you are asking me, we are doing a good job on research. We are spending far more per victim on ENTITY research than we are on heart disease or cancer, which are far greater killers. We have got to do more in the education front on ENTITY. When I talked to the researchers at National Institutes of Health, I think they feel that they could use more money, but I do not think they feel a shortage of research funds is what is important. We are trying to speed ENTITY research drugs to market even though some are going to accuse us of getting them there before they have been fully tested. I think maybe we need to do more in terms of education. And that is one reason I'd like to see Magic Johnson on our National ENTITY Commission, if he feels that it is something he is interested in doing.

And one thing, of course, is going to be we have to be vigilant and cannot let our guard down, because a terrorist threat still exists. Ronald Reagan had said, Are we doing a good enough job teaching our children what America is and what she represents in the long history of the world? In his statement of saying there is a great tradition of Presidential warnings as they leave the White House. I have not really viewed the farewell address in terms of Presidential warnings, but I can-it makes sense to say, I have learned this, and I wish my successor all the best, and America needs to be on the lookout. One option for me is to talk about isolationism and protectionism, and that it is very important for us to resist those isms. The world needs our presence. The people dying of ENTITY on the continent of Africa need a robust response by the United States to save lives. We need voices calling upon coalition members to stay in the fight against the terrorists. And protectionism is rearing its ugly head; witness the fact that we had trouble getting good free trade agreements through the Congress with Panama and Colombia and South Korea. And so maybe that is what I will warn about as well. How should we use former Presidents? How do you want to be used, in what capacity, as you leave this office?

Early on in the Presidency I said, I want time to work out, because I think it is -I know part of being a-doing this job is to be a disciplined person. Like, I start meetings on time; I end them on time. I have got a routine that obviously varies depending on the moment, but a routine that is pretty well set. You know, I get here early in the morning and meet with the Chief of Staff and the National Security Adviser, then meet with the intelligence people. And the reason why is, is that I think it is important for ENTITY to be predictable among the people with whom he works, so that there is not a sloppiness in the organization. And anybody can find time to exercise if they put their mind to it. What in your life created the schedule that you now carry out? I was undisciplined at times. But you know, I used to drink too much, which is a sign of being undisciplined. And it took discipline to quit and maybe a little help from a higher authority. But I was not a knee-walking drunk, but I was-you know, I was drinking, and alcohol was beginning to compete for my affections. One night I had too much to drink in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and have not had a drink since. I do not know where it comes from, maybe my mom and dad. I have not sat around and tried to figure it out; I can just tell you it is true. How much time do you spend reading? I do not really watch a lot of TV, in all due respect. Of course, if I did, I'd be watching you. But I read a lot. I read a lot on airplanes; I read a lot upstairs at the White House; I read on the exercise bicycle. What do you take away from books? I mean, how do you translate what you read into how you make decisions or how you go about your business? Well, sometimes books are just to escape, like mysteries, and it is just a chance to get your mind off the moment. Sometimes I read books to-a lot of history books, and I can take lessons away from the books, like Abraham Lincoln.

And Lincoln went out of his way to be with the sergeants and the enlisted personnel as well as the generals. And he-you know, he visited the wounded a lot, and he visited with widows a lot. And it is a good lesson for any President. And the lesson is, pay attention to your military and work with your military and show your military that you care for them. And you go to a hospital and see these wounded kids and word gets out all across the-you know, all across the system, where-and I have met with a lot of the families of the fallen, which is my duty, but I think the troops appreciate that, that ENTITY cares enough about their comrades' families that he would meet with them. And yes, it is an interesting experience to do that. The comforter in chief is the person who usually gets comforted. You have had a number of events here as we begin to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's bicentennial. His picture is here, obviously, his bust in this office. That is one example about the Lincoln Presidency. But what else in the 17 or 18 books that you have read on Lincoln do you take away from what he meant for this office and the country? Well, he spoke with moral clarity on certain truths. And one basic truth was, all men are created equal under God; 1864, he could have easily have said, well, maybe not all of us are created equal. But Lincoln spoke with certainty. And I think Presidents need to do that, need to speak moral truth, have a set of principles that are inviolate. Why do I have to carry this burden? And first of all, I do not believe it is a burden to be ENTITY. I do not believe there is -it is not a burden to deal with problems. But Lincoln keeps things in perspective. If you think you got a lousy time, think about what Abraham Lincoln went through. 600,000 people died; he lost his son up-stairs-Willie died in the White House; his wife was not happy. And yet he was a man who stuck to principles and stayed strong and died not having any earthly idea of where his standing would be in history.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevescullycspan", "title": "Interview With Steve Scully of C-SPAN", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-scully-c-span", "publication_date": "18-12-2008", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

Every President is going to have to deal with that. And it is essential that the President assure the people-and when these books come out, assure the people here that- I trust you a lot. And I think my words calmed some of the folks I work with down, that they did not feel alienated. First person who is asked me that. In our remaining minute, let me ask you about this office. It is based upon a Methodist hymn called A Charge To Keep I Have, that was sung when I was first inaugurated Governor of Texas. And my friend O'Neil, Joe I. O'Neil, from Midland, Texas, said, I got a painting based upon that hymn. Would you like to use it? And I looked at it and said, absolutely. It is by W.H.D. Koerner. The thing about O'Neil that is important is he introduced me and Laura in his backyard. He and Jan had a little barbeque out there, and there was two other guests, me and Laura. The importance of that painting is that it is obviously a religious painting. And I tell people ENTITY should never promote a religion. But ENTITY always ought to jealously guard and defend the right for anybody to worship or not worship, that we are all equal, if we are Hindu, Jew, Muslim. The greatness about America is you can choose and worship the way you want to worship. I entertain people here quite a bit. I said, What are you talking about? Well, it turns out the Resolute is famous in National Treasure, which I have not seen yet. But it is even more famous because Presidents have used it. Roosevelt put the door on there. Out the door John-John Kennedy poked his head in the most famous Oval Office photo. And President Reagan put the bottom there to lift it up. The desk was given to us by Queen Victoria.

What do you think the prospects are, especially looking at the early initial reaction that you got yesterday? What do you make of that? Well, first, I think it is a good sign that we have the Republican leadership with the door open. That is what having Senator Roth and having Congressman Thomas and the other two Republican congressmen there- McCrery from Louisiana, in particular, is a guy I know and have a regard for. McCrery would like to make an agreement on Medicare and Social Security-very serious man. I think, also, the breadth of the presence of the Democrats indicates that the most liberal Democrats have acknowledged that we need to make serious structural reform; and our moderate-to-conservative Democrats believe that this is enough structural reform to unify and coalesce around. So I think we have got something to go forward on. And what I intend to do is to call the leaders-Senator Lott and the Speaker and Senator Daschle and Mr. Gephardt-and ask them to come and meet with me the day we get back from Fourth of July recess, and let us try to make a plan for how we could do it this summer. Because I believe that I can do the same thing with the Social Security I have done with Medicare, I can offer them something. We could even maybe build on it and get the-done, because we cannot know that we are really going to pay the debt off which, as you know, I believe is profoundly important, unless we understand where we are on both. But I think the first thing to do is to get the Medicare because there is a real interest in it. When you have this meeting with the congressional leadership, are you going to give them a deadline for action? What will you do, specifically, at the meeting? What do you want to come out of it? Well, what I want to come out of it more than anything else is a common commitment to the goal. In other words, if the leaders will all say we want to do this and we think we can, it does not mean we will, but it will get us a lot closer. That will send a signal to the rank and file in both caucuses that this is something we are really going to try to do.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusanpageusatodayaboardairforceone", "title": "Interview With Susan Page of USA Today Aboard Air Force One", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susan-page-usa-today-aboard-air-force-one", "publication_date": "30-06-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

We are close enough now; we are much closer now, frankly, on Medicare than we were before we did the omnibus balanced budget in '97. This meeting or really the release of the plan is the start of a process. Some people think the end of the process could be a deal that enables Republicans to get some of the tax cuts they want and you to get the Medicare plan you want. Is that a possible end of this? Well, I think it depends first on whether we can get close enough so that- on the particulars of the structure of the Medicare-that is, can we get everybody, or more or less everybody for the kind of structural modernization that I think is imperative, where we have some genuine competition, but we do it in a way that does not sacrifice quality-that is why I want to set up this extra fund, because most people believe that in the '97 Balanced Budget Act we had excessive savings in some areas of Medicare from the point of view of providers, so we set aside a fund for the Congress to deal with that-and then whether we can get a general agreement on the structure of the drug benefit. A lot of our people-and I am very sympathetic-and maybe some of theirs would like to accommodate both the people that have huge drug bills and the biotech industry which wants to be able to sell these drugs if they keep investing and pushing the envelope on the big things. But I thought it important not to have a drug benefit that would be subject to the same criticism that we leveled at one of their tax programs back in '97-that, okay, it looks good for 5 years. So now, we have avoided that. But I think that if we can get agreement on the fundamentals of this and then if we can get agreement on real commitment to paying down the debt and taking the interest savings and plowing it into Social Security, then I think there is enough funding left over, not committed to either of those pots, given this new budget, that we can probably make it a kind of omnibus agreement covering other things.

And so that is why I think we have to really-we have got to focus on that. I think the other stuff-assuming, as I said- it is a big assumption-assuming you get the financing right on the Social Security piece, I'd also like to have an omnibus agreement. I am going to try to get them to agree on Social Security, too. And a lot of people-most people do not think we can do that. I spent a lot of time just quietly thinking about it, on our trip to Europe and other things, trying to write out different scenarios. But I think there is much more energy right now behind the Medicare issue and a much greater sense of urgency. And frankly, you have got one that goes broke in 2015 and the other one, if they just hang with the money I have got, will stay all right until 2053 or 2055. So I think Medicare first, see if they want to do it, see if they will commit to try to do it by the summer. And then I think they can raise their other concerns once we get into the framework of the substance. But we have got to stay- this is a big, big-changes in Medicare, and we need to focus on that first. Are you concerned at all, though, that there may be a good number of Democrats who are afraid there will be a deal that they will not like? But none of them think that so far. In other words, I have worked very, very hard to keep our caucus together. I took a good deal of time to come out with the specifics of this plan, and we did a lot of serious work, all of us-and I include the White House in that, too-really trying to take the politics out of this in terms of what specifics we recommended.

{"id": 2313, "text": "So I think that-all I can tell you is that the negotiating process that I would support would be designed to produce an agreement that would be supported by the overwhelming majority of our caucus, and I would hope the overwhelming majority of theirs. If you look at the balanced budget agreement, we did a pretty good job. They had a slightly higher percentage of Republicans voting for it in the House than the Democrats, and in the Senate we had a slightly higher percentage of Democrats voting for it than Republicans. I think to get an agreement, we are going to have to do that. Given how important it is to you to try to win the Congress back, or as much as you could, for your party, do you ever feel personally torn about a deal versus trying to give Al Gore and the Democrats an issue? No, because I do not believe- it might help some individual Republicans get reelected to Congress if they voted for such an agreement, but I believe that for Democrats what is good policy is almost always the best politics. The do right rule is almost always best for us because we get hired to do things. The American people, when they vote for Democrats, they hire them. They give you this job, and you get a contract, and your contract is 2 years, 6 years, or 4 years if you are President; and they hire us to go to work every day and to do things. And I do not believe-for example, it did not hurt the Democrats in 1998 that we had a big budget at the end where there was a compromise that a lot of Republicans voted for, and we got the big downpayment on 100,000 teachers and a lot of other educational priorities. It did not hurt them at all. The only-this is not going to turn into a status quo country, and there are too many issues on which we are too deeply divided. If we can reach agreement on-and I am not saying this could happen-if we could reach agreement on Medicare, Social Security, taxes, investments in education, and there would still be differences in 2000 on next steps in education, on guns, on patients' rights, even if we pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, there are going to be differences, unresolved differences, on choice, on a lot of issues.

So I think that actually both parties will be better off in dealing with the agenda of the 21st century. If we dealt with the baby boom problems right now, if we dealt with Social Security and Medicare and committed to pay the debt down, if we did all that, the Republicans would still say we need more for tax cuts than maybe we will get, or here is our next round of tax cuts, or whatever. One last question on Medicare, before we turn to new markets. Senator Breaux was critical, saying your plan did not go far enough by addressing structural reforms. And you, yourself, since Putting People First, have supported things like means testing. Are you frustrated that politically it was not possible to go farther than you went in this Medicare plan? No, I think-well, first of all, I think the structural reforms in the health care-there are two issues there. One is the means testing, which was not in his report, either, because some of the Republicans did not go for it. I do not think that is as big a problem as some people do, and I will come back to that. The second is an area on which we have an honest disagreement-Breaux and Thomas and me-and it is an honest disagreement. I want there to be-I want the managed care Medicare people to be given the maximum opportunity to make their program attractive to people in the traditional fee-for-service program, if they can do so.

And we just have an honest, philosophical difference about that. Now, on the upper income premium issue- I ran on that in '92. I have never made any secret to the American people that I think that is the right thing to do. We took the income limit off of the Medicare tax in the '93 balanced budget act. So every wealthy person in America today is paying much more in Medicare taxes than they will use anyway. In other words, if you are making a quarter of a million dollars a year, you do not have that $67,000-I think it was $80,000 cap, something like that-you do not have that cap anymore. So since '93, you have been paying a great deal into the Medicare program. So you do not have the equity argument you used to have. One of the reasons that Medicare program was extended in its life-apart from the cost savings we effected and waste, fraud, and abuse stuff, which we really did better about than most of us thought we could-is that we took the earnings limitation off the Medicare tax, and I think that a lot of times people who say upper income people should pay more have forgotten that and forgotten just what a significant amount of money that is to a lot of people. We better turn to new markets, because we want to talk a little about that, too. So you are going next week from Appalachia to Watts. Tell us why you are doing the tour.

So we do not have any signs of inflation, but should not they be worried about it, since nobody really thought we could have it? Everyone knows that the technology explosion, especially in telecommunications and information technology, has dramatically increased productivity in ways that traditional economic models do not measure. Is there any way we could keep this economic recovery going, creating even more jobs, raising incomes even more, and not have inflation? And the answer is, yes, if you can either find more customers for American goods and services or more workers to come in and produce more so they are not just being added on for the same level of production. Now, what are the possibilities for that? Expanded trade, which is why I have worked very hard to build a consensus in my own party for trade, plus labor and environmental standards- why I went to Geneva and made those speeches, why I went to the University of Chicago and all that-for trade. The most obvious ones in America are more people from welfare to work. Tonight I had Eli Segal at the fundraiser, if you listened in on that. He is now got 12,000 companies in this deal where we are trying to hire even hard-to-place welfare recipients and train them. Because that is adding to the productive capacity. You get people who are both workers and consumers. The other big discrete population are the disabled, which is why this thing that apparently we are going to have an overwhelming bipartisan majority of Congress do, which is to let disabled people keep their Medicaid in the work force, it is potentially a very big, positive contribution to long-term growth, because, again, you are creating more workers and more consumers.

We really pushed it. So we will do a little of that, hear things that are working now. The second thing I want to do is to point out that one of the reasons there has not been more investment in these areas is that there is imperfect knowledge on the part of the American business and investment community. The head of Aetna insurance company, when we went to Atlanta, when we did our pre-trip-on the way back he was ragging me. He said, You know, I am the only guy here who is not happy we did this, because, he said, I'd already figured all this out by myself, and now all my competitors are going to know.

That is just retail sales, no small-scale manufacturing, no professional services, none of that other stuff, all the other things you could do.

Because all these other things we have done-even though the CRA, the Community Investment Act, is a nationwide law, it depends still in part on the vigors of the bankers in specific places, and all the other things have discreet impacts.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusanpageusatodayaboardairforceone", "title": "Interview With Susan Page of USA Today Aboard Air Force One", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susan-page-usa-today-aboard-air-force-one", "publication_date": "30-06-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 2318, "text": "In other words, we do not have a community development bank everywhere; we do not have an enterprise zone or empowerment community everywhere-I mean, an empowerment zone or an enterprise community everywhere. This new markets initiative basically is designed to put in place for the whole Nation, all distressed areas the same incentives that we give America to invest in developing economies overseas. I think they ought to have those incentives, developing economies at home. So, for example, the way this would work is let us suppose someone wanted to build a $150 million shopping center in East St. Louis and open 20 stores-I am just making this up-and they started with $50 million of investments; they have got a $50 million investment fund. On that $50 million they could get tax credits of 25 percent for their investment. They would also be able to go to the bank and borrow $100 million and have that $100 million subject to the Government guarantee, which would dramatically lower the interest rate that they would be charged to borrow the money, because if they defaulted on the loan, the Government would guarantee it. And those are the kinds of mechanisms we have in place now for people who invest in developing markets overseas. The reason that is important is, number one, unlike the empowerment zones, it would be nationwide, and number two, even if you had perfect knowledge on the part of investors, that you do not have now, there would be, in many of these places, somewhat greater risk to the investment than in a traditional investment. So by providing these two big incentives you lower the relative risk of this investment compared to others and make it even more attractive to do. But if you think about it, this is sort of my classic Third Way kind of approach. In the 1980's, we found out for sure that free enterprise alone would not develop these areas into the 1990's. In the 1960's, with the whole Great Society approach, it is not true that it did not accomplish anything. It accomplished a great deal. It fed people; it educated people; it started Head Start; it provided health care in rural areas; it provided some Government-funded jobs. But there was no internal structural change that would allow a lot of these places to become more self-sufficient on a long-term basis.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusanpageusatodayaboardairforceone", "title": "Interview With Susan Page of USA Today Aboard Air Force One", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susan-page-usa-today-aboard-air-force-one", "publication_date": "30-06-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

And that means fewer people on the streets. It means you will not lose as many kids. It means a lot of things when times are tough. But it seems to me that there is an enormous interest in this now, in the business community. You can see it in the Wall Street Project that Jesse Jackson and Dick Grasso and others have done for the last few years, and you can see it in the massive commitment that-and NationsBank made to setting up community banks and microenterprise lending over the next 10 years. They made a huge commitment on their own. A lot of great things have happened in our empowerment zones. A lot of these development banks are beginning to really show some results. But there is no either nationwide awareness or nationwide framework which could be applied to every place. And that is what the new markets initiative is all about. It is about just increasing the awareness and the attractiveness of these areas to the investment community and then putting in place a framework that would make it even more attractive to invest now. And if we could get a lot of this done while the economy is growing, I think the benefits to America could be permanent. I think, in that sense, it is the perfect public/private partnership example that I have been trying to develop all along. I am really excited about it. I am just-it is a real dream of mine to prove this can be done. You will apparently be the first sitting ENTITY to ever go to an Indian reservation. I am sorry it has taken me so long, because I spent a lot of time with Native American leaders. I went to reservations back in '92, and I spent enormous time with the leaders of the tribes over the last 6 1/2 years. Some people would say you have done a lot-you have focused on empowerment zones; you have focused on some of these problems of poverty, people who have not participated in the economic good times-but that we have not heard so much about it lately, '95, '96.

{"id": 2320, "text": "One is, I think that there is a feeling that the prosperity of the country is broadly shared, and that is right. We have got the lowest minority unemployment rates we have recorded. In the last couple of years, we have finally started to close the inequality gap. We have had substantial increases in wages for people in the lower 40 percent of our earnings. And there is a level of security about the direction of our economy that I think frees people in a way to think about those things that are still not done, because I think most Americans genuinely want to see everybody who is willing to work have a chance to participate in this. Secondly, I believe that it is an essential component of my effort to keep this economy growing without inflation, as I said. In other words, I think moving people from welfare to work is a moral imperative, but I also think it is very good for the economy. I think giving disabled people a chance to take their Medicaid and get in the work force is morally right; I also think it is very good for the economy, and I think this could be even better for the economy, and it is certainly morally right. We tried to do this in the past, and we have gotten kind of sporadic publicity for it. But we worked consistently at it. It is one of the many things that I asked the Vice President to lead. But he has done a superb job of this, and he is been systematic and disciplined. And just slowly, slowly, slowly over the last 6 years, I think we have completely satisfied that a lot of these communities, if they can get enough investment, can really take off and do well. So I think that the timing is really right now for America to think about this as sort of the next economic agenda. I know we have to leave, but speaking of economic good times, George Bush has raised $36 million so far in the first half of this year. What do you think about that? Do you think this has gotten out of-spiraled out of control? Or is this not-what do you think? It just seems like a stunning number today. It is a big number, but you have got to remember, Republicans have more money than Democrats, and they always promise upper income people bigger tax cuts. And he is the Governor of Texas; his brother is the Governor of Florida; and they have been out for 8 years, and they want in. So all those reasons mean big numbers.

{"id": 2321, "text": "When I ran in '92-8 years ago-in a State of 2.5 million people, with a lower per capita income and not nearly as many millionaires, we raised $4 million. That would be the equivalent of $20 million or more in Texas. So he is got a lot going for him. He is a Governor of a State; his brother is a Governor of a State; his father was President. They want to win; they have got more money than we do anyway. So I think that it is a credit to-he is got good people raising that money, obviously, but I am not at all surprised they have raised that kind of money. Which also raises the point that conventional wisdom probably told us the Democratic nomination would be sewed up at this point, but the Republican would not ; and it is actually the opposite, it appears to be actually perhaps the opposite of that. It depends; the voters in Iowa and New Hampshire will not be as influenced by the money, probably, just because there is only so many of them. There is only so much you can-but I think the real problem for all these guys, and one reason they can compellingly go out and raise this money-I mean, arguably, if you are talking about the money Bradley raised, he was a national figure for longer than any of the other people running in the Republican primary, except for Elizabeth Dole; maybe she was. But she was in the Cabinet, but Bradley was a nationally known figure for 18 years in the Senate, from the day he got there, and traveled the country extensively all that time building a network, for all 18 years. So I am not particularly surprised that he is raised a good deal of money. But I think that-to go back to the main point-one of the reasons all these people can compellingly argue that they need to get out and raise this money early is that, unfortunately, it not only gets more and more expensive to advertise with every election cycle, the States at the back end get more and more anxietyridden, so they keep moving their dates up.

If you have to run in Iowa and New Hampshire, you have got to know things. You have got to take time. So I believe in that. Keep in mind, on June 2d in 1992-June 2d-you had California, New Jersey, and Ohio. I am not particularly surprised about the amount of money anybody has raised. Are you concerned that it is bad news for Gore? I do not think that at all. I do not think that at all. I mean, I think the Republicans are going to raise more money than us. They outspent $100 million last year. They take care of their interest groups. The NRA's going to give them a ton of money. Look what they have done on the Patients' Bill of Rights. Everybody in the world with an opinion is for the Patients' Bill of Rights, except one, who is health insurance. But the health insurance might wind up giving more money in the election cycle than all the 200 groups that are for us. And so, that is the dynamic of modern politics. And their whole strategy is to rake in that dough and to dominate the communications. It does not matter in our politics if your opponent outraises you if you raise enough. The only issue in modern politics is whether you have enough. And keep in mind, in the primary process-unless Governor Bush is going to slow the campaign finance law and not take any matching funds-in the primary process, the only thing that really matters is whether you can raise all the money you need before the first primary starts so you can rationally plan how to spend it during the remainder of the primary season.

{"id": 2324, "text": "It is very good of you to call, so I will get right to it. I am in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. I am following around one of your newest-well, not your newest rivals but one of the newest candidates for President on the Republican side, Pete Wilson. So let me begin by asking you about your speech on Monday concerning the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. How do you plan to outline ways for the U.N. to reconstitute itself for the next 50 years? Well, I think we have to, first of all, recognize that-I think there are two fundamental realities we have to recognize. Number one is that the end of the cold war gives the U.N. the possibility of living up to the dreams of its founders in ways that were simply impossible when the world was divided into two large blocs. And so I think there should be a lot of hope about the U.N. The second thing I think we have to recognize is that in order for that hope to be realized, the U.N. has got to be properly run and, in particular, the peacekeeping operations have to be properly run. And the United States has spent a lot of time, because we pay a lot of the costs of the U.N., analyzing how the overall operations can be more efficient and cost-effective and inspire more confidence in the countries that are paying the bills and, in particular, looking at the peacekeeping operations and setting up systems to make sure that we use peacekeeping when it will work, that we restrain it when the situation is not right, and that the command-and-control operations are absolutely clear, that we do not have any kind of mixed signals and crossed lines that have sometimes happened in the past. And then when you look ahead into the future, I think it is clear that the new problems of the 21st century are likely to be rooted in ethnic, religious, and other internal problems within countries and across borders; dealing with or helping to avoid natural disasters that are brought on by a combination of population explosion and natural problems like the inability to produce food; and the rise of terrorism and the danger of proliferation of biological, chemical, and small-scale nuclear weapons. I think-and so I want to talk about kind of the threats to the future security of the members of the United Nations and how we have a new set of threats, an unprecedented opportunity, and we have to clean up our-operate- clean up implies- that has the wrong implication.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusanyoachumthesanfranciscochroniclepinebluffarkansas", "title": "Interview With Susan Yoachum of the San Francisco Chronicle in Pine Bluff, Arkansas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susan-yoachum-the-san-francisco-chronicle-pine-bluff-arkansas", "publication_date": "24-06-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 2325, "text": "I do not want to imply that there is anything unsavory about it, but it is just that the operation, I think, really needs to be streamlined and reformed in order to inspire confidence in all the member nations. As you know, both our-the last two Congresses, one was a Democratic Congress and this Republican Congress, expressed varying levels of opposition to some of the U.N. operations. But the last Congress was far more focused on getting the U.N. to work right, not having America walk away from its responsibilities and became more isolationist. But I will also say back to my fellow Americans and to the Congress that we should continue to support the United Nations, that they do a lot of work in the world that the United States might have to do alone or might eventually be pulled into doing, because they keep problems from becoming as bad as they would otherwise be. ENTITY, given the difficulties, the highly publicized difficulties, of course, with the U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and other U.N. difficulties, does not it make it more difficult for you to try to sell this to Americans, and do not you run some political risk in trying to do so? Well, I suppose there is -in a time like this, when a lot of people are bewildered almost by all the things that are going on in the world and the apparent conflicts of all the good forces and the troubling forces rising up at once, there is some political risk in everything. I think the-I think it is important not to define the-first of all, I think it is important not to define the U.N. solely in terms of Bosnia. I mean, there was also-I'd ask the United States to remember that we went into Haiti with a multinational force that restored the Aristide government and democracy, but we were able to hand it off to a U.N. force with even more nations involved, where there were more countries paying for it. I think most Americans know that there are going to be problems all around the world that affect United States interests and that can affect United States citizens, and it is better to have a larger number of nations working on those problems and a larger number of nations paying for the solutions to those problems.

{"id": 2326, "text": "But if you look at it, the people in Northern Ireland fought for 25 years, the people in the Middle East fought for more than four decades before there was any peace progress there. And for all the frustration people in our country have with the problems in Bosnia, the casualty rates have gone way, way down since the U.N. forces went on the ground there and since the United States began to support them with massive humanitarian airlifts and with our operation to keep the war from going into the air. That is what Captain O'Grady was doing when he was shot down; he was enforcing the no-fly zone. And I think it is important never to forget that. Before the United Nations became involved and before we became as aggressive as we were in trying to provide air help, in 1992, there were about 130,000 people killed in that civil war. In 1994, the death rate was down to under-about 3,500. So I think that it is important, even in Bosnia, to keep this in perspective. The United Nations did not succeed in ending the war in Bosnia. The United Nations did not go in there to militarily defeat the Bosnian Serbs, and they are not capable of doing that, and that was never what they were established- that is not what they were sent there to do. But the war has become less violent and has been at least contained to Bosnia and has not spread beyond its borders. So with all of our frustrations, I think it is important to remember that. You will be doing a number of things in your speech on Monday, which has been, I think, widely anticipated around the world. And certainly, the patron saint of the U.N. 50 celebration, Walter Shorenstein, says that it is a real opportunity for you to give a world-class speech.

And now we have people in our country and, most importantly, people in our Congress, who want to walk away from our global responsibilities and walk away from the opportunity to cooperate with people in ways that permit others to carry some share of the load. You know, sometimes I get the feeling that some of the critics of our cooperation with other countries want it both ways. They want to be able to run the world and tell everybody exactly how to behave, and then not have to cooperate with anybody when they have a slight difference of opinion from us or even if they are willing to put their troops on the ground and put their money up. That is the case in Bosnia, where the Europeans said, We will take the lead. We will put our troops on the ground. This will be paid for through the United Nations, so you will not have to pay for any more than your regular assessment. We ask you for your air power and the support of the NATO, but we are going to follow the prescribed United Nations policy. We are not going to let the U.S. dictate policy, especially when it is our troops and our lives that are at risk. And I think we cannot have it both ways. We cannot become an isolationist country, and we cannot dictate every other country's course. And it is better for us to be a leader within the framework of the United Nations, which means that from time to time we will have to cooperate with people and agree on a policy that may reflect more of a consensus than our absolute best desires.

We still are able to do the things we need to do to be-for example, to keep a firm hand with Serbia; we have been able to keep other countries from lifting the sanctions off Iraq; we have been able to get a tougher line-in many ways, we were able to have our policy in Haiti prevail.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusanyoachumthesanfranciscochroniclepinebluffarkansas", "title": "Interview With Susan Yoachum of the San Francisco Chronicle in Pine Bluff, Arkansas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susan-yoachum-the-san-francisco-chronicle-pine-bluff-arkansas", "publication_date": "24-06-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

But I do intend to say that this is going to be a 21st century organization, that it is more than a debating forum and-that involves a collective decision by the community of free nations to deploy people all across the world, not just in military situations, like peacekeeping, but in other ways, where it is going to have to be run very well and it is going to have to be able to inspire the confidence of taxpaying citizens not only in the United States but throughout the world. But I think-I still think the fundamental fact is that the end of the cold war permits the U.N. to live up to its full potential; that we ought to become-we ought to stay involved, we ought to pay our fair share, and we ought to be very grateful that there are other countries that are willing to spend their money and actually put their people at risk in places where either we would not do it or we do not now have to do it all, we do not have to carry the whole load; and that we ought to be willing to lead in an atmosphere in which we also have to cooperate from time to time, especially when others are making a greater sacrifice and when the problem's in their backyard. And that is- that is the sort of future we ought to want. And we also ought to be mature enough to recognize that as long as human beings are alive on the Earth, bad things will happen, problems will exist, and that there will never be a complete and easy solution to all the problems in the world. But far better this course into the future than either having the nuclear cloud hang over the world, as it did in the cold war, or having the U.S. become an isolationist power, as we did between the wars, and run the risk of other terrible things happening all around the world which would drag us back into another war in the future.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusanyoachumthesanfranciscochroniclepinebluffarkansas", "title": "Interview With Susan Yoachum of the San Francisco Chronicle in Pine Bluff, Arkansas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susan-yoachum-the-san-francisco-chronicle-pine-bluff-arkansas", "publication_date": "24-06-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 2329, "text": "In other words, the course that I advocate is not problem-free because as long as there are people and as long as bad people can get political power in various places, there will always be problems in the world. But it is far better than the alternative, better than what we went through in the cold war and better than having an American isolationism. Sir, one question away from the U.N., and that is the subject of military bases. One of your political allies, Senator Boxer, has asked you to consider sparing some of the bases in California slated to be closed. At the same time, one of your political opponents, Pete Wilson, plans to attack the administration in a speech this evening in New Hampshire for what he says are artificially low target levels that OMB has given the Department of Defense, which has resulted in a need to close more military bases than necessary to meet the budget targets. I am wondering first, on the political ally side, if there is any chance that you would spare any of the bases in California, and on the political opponent side, what you would say to that criticism by Governor Wilson? Well, first of all, let us deal with the base issue. The way the base closings works is-the way the base closing process works is that the commission votes on which bases to close. Then they send it to me in a package, which they will do on July 1st. I can accept it, in which case it goes to Congress, and unless Congress rejects it, it goes into law; the second option is I can reject it out of hand, in which case there are no base closings; the third option is that I can send it back to the commission with recommended changes. And I have to tell you that with regard to California, as you know, the McClellan Air Base was not on our list. And it was not on our list, basically-it was not on the Pentagon list for two reasons, both of which I thought were good reasons. One was that California had about 20 percent of the defense investment for the country, but it sustained 40 percent of the base cuts in the first two rounds. The other is that the Pentagon thought that a better way to deal with the problem of over-capacity in what is done at McClellan and down at Kelly Air Force Base in Texas was to shave some of the capacity off all five of the sites around the country and presented a plan to do that.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusanyoachumthesanfranciscochroniclepinebluffarkansas", "title": "Interview With Susan Yoachum of the San Francisco Chronicle in Pine Bluff, Arkansas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susan-yoachum-the-san-francisco-chronicle-pine-bluff-arkansas", "publication_date": "24-06-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 2330, "text": "So I am concerned specifically-I am concerned about the decision made by the Base Closing Commission there, but I have to be careful about further comment until they send them all to me. Now secondly, Governor Wilson is just wrong about what he said about defense. Basically, my defense numbers have been about the same as the Republicans of Congress have recommended and what the Pentagon has asked for. And the truth is that the ENTITY people-all the military people but particularly the ENTITY-will tell you that we have brought the force structure down, we have reduced defense in real dollar terms about 40 percent since 1987 and we have reduced the size of the military by about 40 percent, and we have reduced our base structure, oh, about less than half that, considerably less than half that. So most of the military experts will tell you that the reduction of base structure in the United States and throughout the world has lagged far behind the reduction in numbers of people in the military. And I have tried to be very sensitive since I have been in office to the economic impact of this, to trying to give these bases a chance to do alternative things like help to develop a civilian mission as well as a military mission, and a lot of that work is being done at McClellan and in some other places as well in California and throughout the country. But it is just not true to say that inadequate budgets have led to the closing of more bases than were necessary. We have, in fact, tried to keep more open than the strict, harsh numbers would dictate, given how much the size of our forces have been reduced. I am sure it is good politics for him to say that in New Hampshire or wherever else, but it is simply not true. I was just going to ask the ENTITY if Governor Wilson really is the candidate he fears most and if there is any chance that McClellan will or may not open? Well, first of all, let me just say those two questions are totally independent of one another. From the day I became ENTITY I worked hard to help California, and I think the people of California know that. We have given aid because of the earthquakes and the fires on more generous terms than had previously been the case. Thirty-three percent of our defense conversion money to develop new technologies from old defense technologies in the commercial sector have gone into California, a disproportionate amount.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusanyoachumthesanfranciscochroniclepinebluffarkansas", "title": "Interview With Susan Yoachum of the San Francisco Chronicle in Pine Bluff, Arkansas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susan-yoachum-the-san-francisco-chronicle-pine-bluff-arkansas", "publication_date": "24-06-1995", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 2331, "text": "It looks like wages are really starting to pick up now, and this is benefiting even people on the bottom rung of the economic ladder. But this is something that is worrying Wall Street because you saw the reaction to the employment report that the worry is that as wages rise, that this could create inflation. Do you think that wages are rising so fast that you could create an inflation problem? I do not think there is any evidence of that now for a couple of reasons. One is, you know, we had about 20 years when, in effect, there was no real rise in wages for people in the middle and the lower income groups, and they have had a good rise. It is been going on for about 3 years now. But we have seen enough experience, at least so far, that we do not see the signs of inflation. I also believe the fact that we have open markets and, therefore, lots of competition and a lot of productivity increases fueled by technology should give us some encouragement there. But based on the present evidence, I think people are-they are earning their pay increases, and they have worked hard for them, and so far, I do not think there is evidence of inflation. ENTITY, on Wall Street, they say that the direction of the stock market is a good predictor of where the economy is headed 6 to 9 months into the future. We have seen some rallies recently, but still stocks are down 10 percent or more from their recent highs. Do you think that the stock market is telling us that rough times are ahead? No, I do not , because, keep in mind, the stock market was 3,200 when I took office. It was 6,500 in 1996, late in '96. You are just not going to have that every 5 years. But I think that the most important thing I can say is that from my point of view, is that, as Secretary Rubin used to say, Markets go up. What the Government should focus on is keeping the fundamentals right. And it seems to me that if we can keep paying down the debt, practice fiscal responsibility, keep pushing to open markets, and keep making the kind of long-term investments that we know are good for the American economy, then the people in the private sector will take care of the rest. I think you really get in trouble trying to predict what is going to happen in the global economy where already we have defied all the predictions.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusiegharibthenightlybusinessreport", "title": "Interview With Susie Gharib of the Nightly Business Report", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susie-gharib-the-nightly-business-report", "publication_date": "11-08-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 2332, "text": "You know, when I became ENTITY, the consensus was that if we had two or more quarters of unemployment below 6 percent, we'd have inflation. Now, that does not mean that the laws of economics have been repealed; it must mean that our ability to predict is not as great as it would have been in a more stable time. So I am basically quite optimistic about the American economy as long as we keep the fundamentals right. You mentioned Robert Rubin, and there are some people who believe that since Robert Rubin left his post as Treasury Secretary, that the administration has modified its policy on the dollar. Can you clarify this for us? And we have seen the dollar under pressure recently. Do you no longer support a strong dollar policy? No, we have not modified our policy. I think that what you have seen with the dollar is partly a function of an expected recovery in Asia, and I think that on balance, that is good. And the European economy may be growing a little more; on balance, that is good. Plus, you know, to try to help our friends in Asia and Russia get through this crisis-and the Chinese particularly have had-even they have had a little bit of problems-we have run quite a large trade deficit here because we have not wanted to close our markets since they were in trouble. Those things happen-that tends to weaken the currency too, after a certain amount of time. So I have not been particularly alarmed by it, but neither am I for a weak dollar. I think the United States has to be for a strong dollar. And again, I say the way for us to do that is to not abandon our budgetary discipline and our long-term policies on expanded trade and investments and technology. ENTITY, let us talk a little bit about taxes. You have been quite adamant, and so has your administration, that any kind of tax cut above $300 billion is no deal. And yet now we are hearing that you may be open to discussion and some negotiation on this. What I am flexible about is what is in the tax cut. It is interesting-if you look at my tax bill of $250 billion and the Republicans with $800 billion, we have almost exactly the same benefits for middle class people, they are just differently configured. But the size of the middle class tax cut in both packages is about the same. What I have said-I do not even think they ought to adopt my tax cut first.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusiegharibthenightlybusinessreport", "title": "Interview With Susie Gharib of the Nightly Business Report", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susie-gharib-the-nightly-business-report", "publication_date": "11-08-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 2333, "text": "I would be opposed if they said-if they call me tomorrow, and they said, You know, we slept on it last night, and we decided you were right, and we like not only the size of your tax cut, but what is in it, and we'd like to send it to you next week. I think it is wrong, on principle, to pass a tax cut before you figure out what your obligations are. And Senator Breaux and Mr. Thomas had this Medicare condition. I thought there were some good things in it; there were some things I did not agree with. So I gave Congress a Medicare plan that would lengthen the life of the Trust Fund and pay for a modest prescription drug benefit. I also gave them a budget which would, over time, not only save the Social Security surplus taxes for Social Security but would lengthen the life of the Trust Fund. And I gave them a budget which said, here is what I would spend for defense, for education, for other things, and here is what I would spend for a tax cut. What I think they ought to do is give me a Medicare proposal. Then let us get together and work out what we are going to do with that. Then let us figure out what we have to spend. Already this Congress, even under the Republican leadership, has decided to spend more for veterans, for agriculture, and for defense. And they say they want to spend more for education. But their tax cut makes it clear, specifically in the tax bill, that they had to cut all these things drastically that they are voting to spend more money on. So my position is, send me a Medicare proposal; let us figure out what we have to spend on other things and what we have got to do to pay the debt down, and let us give the rest back to the taxpayers. And I will be very flexible about how we do it. We had Pete Domenici, chairman of the Budget Committee, on our program recently, and he was saying that when you look at the whole surplus, only a quarter of it would be devoted to these tax cut proposals, things like an income tax cut, estate tax cut, cut in the marriage penalty tax. And even your Vice President, Mr. Gore, was on our program recently-he said he would support a cut in the marriage penalty tax. Is there anything here among these tax cuts that you might support?", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusiegharibthenightlybusinessreport", "title": "Interview With Susie Gharib of the Nightly Business Report", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susie-gharib-the-nightly-business-report", "publication_date": "11-08-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 2334, "text": "But the question is- let me just say, in all respect to Senator Domenici, they say it that way because it sounds so reasonable, but that is not quite right, and here is why. The Republicans have agreed with me- and I applaud them for this-they have agreed that we should take that portion of the surplus- projected surplus-it is not here yet-that portion of projected surplus attributable to Social Security taxes and not spend it. That leaves a third left. When you take their tax cut, plus the extra interest payments we have to make-because when you cut taxes, you do not pay the debt off as fast-it takes up everything that is left, which means that they have no money to spend whatever on defense, on education, on lengthening the life of the Medicare Trust Fund, and yet they are voting to do these things. So they either want to get into the Social Security surplus, at which case we are not going to pay the debt down and we are going to make a big mistake, I think, or they are pursuing the course which will require drastic cuts in the very things they say they are trying to increase. So, on any specific, I am happy to talk to them. I think it would be great to get rid of the marriage penalty. There are a lot of things that they proposed that-in the Senate bill, in the original Senate bill, had a lot of great policy in it. We cannot afford to do that and take care of the American economy. Sir, we are running out of time, so I want to ask you a few more quick questions, okay? ENTITY, I would not be a good business reporter unless I asked you a question about Alan Greenspan. The last time this came up you said you do not even know if Mr. Greenspan would be interested in another term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Now, I am sure you have a lot of contact with Mr. Greenspan, and your Treasury Secretary meets with him from time to time. Well, I saw him just today, actually, when we gave President Ford the Medal of Freedom, but I did not have a chance to talk to him about it. You know, I think he is done a great job. I did reappoint him once. And I think that we have had an appropriate relationship.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsusiegharibthenightlybusinessreport", "title": "Interview With Susie Gharib of the Nightly Business Report", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-susie-gharib-the-nightly-business-report", "publication_date": "11-08-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 2335, "text": "I do not comment on the Fed's actions, but I think we have both pursued complementary policies, and I think he is done a good job. But I think it is not useful for me to feed speculation one way or the other until I have at least had a chance to talk to him. I have no earthly idea what his intentions are, and we have not had a chance to talk. Well, obviously, you have put some focus on the Federal Reserve recently, you recently named Carol Parry to fill one of the boards-he is on the Fed. You have named Roger Ferguson to fill the Vice Chair post. And you have told us that you will deal with the whole Fed Chairman job in a timely manner. Are we getting close to that time? Well, his time-term runs out at some point, and at some point it will be appropriate for the two of us to talk. But I think until the two of us talk, it would be just foolish for me to say anything. It would only cause-whatever I say might be rendered moot by the conversation we have. But I think the important thing is for the American people to know that I support the direction he is taken, and I think he is done a good job. Since you brought him up, though, I think I ought to mention that he, along with others, have pointed out that if we do not pay the debt down and we still have a tax cut that is too big, it will increase the chances of inflation, which will increase the likelihood of interest rate increases. And all the benefits the American people could get in a tax cut, including upper income people, could be taken away by higher interest rates, which not only take more money out of people's pockets directly but will slow economic growth. So I think that that is another thing that ought to be hammered home about this tax cut. Why should we do something on the one hand if we are going to lose the benefit of it from higher interest rates and lower growth? I do not want to tackle with you on that, but I do want to talk to you more about economic growth. I'd like to talk to you about your new markets initiatives. The economy has had this wonderful run and it is been growing for so long, and it is even benefited a lot of the people who are living in economically distressed areas.
