And let no one think that the unfortunate and the oppressed of this land sit stifled and alone in their hope tonight. Hundreds of their servants and their protectors sit before me tonight here in this great Chamber. The Great Society leads us along three roads growth and justice and liberation. First is growth the national prosperity which supports the well-being of our people and which provides the tools of our progress. I can report to you tonight what you have seen for yourselves already in every city and countryside. Workers are making more money than ever with after-tax income in the past 5 years up 33 percent; in the last year alone, up 8 percent. More people are working than ever before in our history an increase last year of 2 1/2 million jobs. Corporations have greater after-tax earnings than ever in history. For the past 5 years those earnings have been up over 65 percent, and last year alone they had a rise of 20 percent. Over the past 5 years it is up 40 percent, and over the past year it is up 22 percent alone. I was informed this afternoon by the distinguished Secretary of the Treasury that his preliminary estimates indicate that our balance of payments deficit has been reduced from $2.8 billion in 1964 to $1.3 billion, or less, in 1965. This achievement has been made possible by the patriotic voluntary cooperation of businessmen and bankers working with your Government. We must now work together with increased urgency to wipe out this balance of payments deficit altogether in the next year. And as our economy surges toward new heights we must increase our vigilance against the inflation which raises the cost of living and which lowers the savings of every family in this land. It is essential, to prevent inflation, that we ask both labor and business to exercise price and wage restraint, and I do so again tonight. I believe it desirable, because of increased military expenditures, that you temporarily restore the automobile and certain telephone excise tax reductions made effective only 12 days ago. Without raising taxes or even increasing the total tax bill paid we should move to improve our withholding system so that Americans can more realistically pay as they go, speed up the collection of corporate taxes, and make other necessary simplifications of the tax structure at an early date.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsannualmessagethecongressthestatetheunion27", "title": "Annual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/annual-message-the-congress-the-state-the-union-27", "publication_date": "12-01-1966", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Lyndon B.

Justice means a man's hope should not be limited by the color of his skin. I propose legislation to establish unavoidable requirements for nondiscriminatory jury selection in Federal and State courts and to give the Attorney General the power necessary to enforce those requirements. I propose legislation to strengthen authority of Federal courts to try those who murder, attack, or intimidate either civil rights workers or others exercising their constitutional rights and to increase penalties to a level equal to the nature of the crime. For that other nation within a Nation the poor whose distress has now captured the conscience of America, I will ask the Congress not only to continue, but to speed up the war on poverty. And in so doing, we will provide the added energy of achievement with the increased efficiency of experience. To improve the life of our rural Americans and our farm population, we will plan for the future through the establishment of several new Community Development Districts, improved education through the use of Teacher Corps teams, better health measures, physical examinations, and adequate and available medical resources. For those who labor, I propose to improve unemployment insurance, to expand minimum wage benefits, and by the repeal of section 14 of the Taft-Hartley Act to make the labor laws in all our States equal to the laws of the 31 States which do not have tonight right-to-work measures. And I also intend to ask the Congress to consider measures which, without improperly invading State and local authority, will enable us effectively to deal with strikes which threaten irreparable damage to the national interest. The third path is the path of liberation. It is to use our success for the fulfillment of our lives. A great nation is one which breeds a great people. A great people flower not from wealth and power, but from a society which spurs them to the fullness of their genius.

Let us fulfill and improve the great health and education programs of last year, extending special opportunities to those who risk their lives in our Armed Forces. I urge the House of Representatives to complete action on three programs already passed by the Senate the Teacher Corps, rent assistance, and home rule for the District of Columbia. In some of our urban areas we must help rebuild entire sections and neighborhoods containing, in some cases, as many as 100,000 people. Working together, private enterprise and government must press forward with the task of providing homes and shops, parks and hospitals, and all the other necessary parts of a flourishing community where our people can come to live the good life. I will offer other proposals to stimulate and to reward planning for the growth of entire metropolitan areas. Of all the reckless devastations of our national heritage, none is really more shameful than the continued poisoning of our rivers and our air. We must undertake a cooperative effort to end pollution in several river basins, making additional funds available to help draw the plans and construct the plants that are necessary to make the waters of our entire river systems clean, and make them a source of pleasure and beauty for all of our people. To attack and to overcome growing crime and lawlessness, I think we must have a stepped-up program to help modernize and strengthen our local police forces. Our people have a right to feel secure in their homes and on their streets and that right just must be secured. Nor can we fail to arrest the destruction of life and property on our highways. I will propose a Highway Safety Act of 1966 to seek an end to this mounting tragedy. We must also act to prevent the deception of the American consumer requiring all packages to state clearly and truthfully their contents all interest and credit charges to be fully revealed and keeping harmful drugs and cosmetics away from our stores. It is the genius of our Constitution that under its shelter of enduring institutions and rooted principles there is ample room for the rich fertility of American political invention.

I will propose in addition a program to construct and to flight-test a new supersonic transport airplane that will fly three times the speed of sound in excess of 2,000 miles per hour. I propose to examine our Federal system-the relation between city, State, Nation, and the citizens themselves. We need a commission of the most distinguished scholars and men of public affairs to do this job. I will ask them to move on to develop a creative federalism to best use the wonderful diversity of our institutions and our people to solve the problems and to fulfill the dreams of the American people. As the process of election becomes more complex and more costly, we must make it possible for those without personal wealth to enter public life without being obligated to a few large contributors. Therefore, I will submit legislation to revise the present unrealistic restriction on contributions to prohibit the endless proliferation of committees, bringing local and State committees under the act to attach strong teeth and severe penalties to the requirement of full disclosure of contributions-and to broaden the participation of the people, through added tax incentives, to stimulate small contributions to the party and to the candidate of their choice. To strengthen the work of Congress I strongly urge an amendment to provide a 4-year term for Members of the House of Representatives-which should not begin before 1972. The present 2-year term requires most Members of Congress to divert enormous energies to an almost constant process of campaigning depriving this Nation of the fullest measure of both their skill and their wisdom. Today, too, the work of government is far more complex than in our early years, requiring more time to learn and more time to master the technical tasks of legislating. And a longer term will serve to attract more men of the highest quality to political life. The Nation, the principle of democracy, and, I think, each congressional district, will all be better served by a 4-year term for Members of the House. And I urge your swift action.

An America that is mighty beyond description-yet living in a hostile or despairing world would be neither safe nor free to build a civilization to liberate the spirit of man. In this pursuit we helped rebuild Western Europe. We gave our aid to Greece and Turkey, and we defended the freedom of Berlin. In this pursuit we have helped new nations toward independence. We have extended the helping hand of the Peace Corps and carried forward the largest program of economic assistance in the world. And in this pursuit we work to build a hemisphere of democracy and of social justice. In this pursuit we have defended against Communist aggression in Korea under President Truman in the Formosa Straits under President Eisenhower in Cuba under President Kennedy and again in Vietnam. Tonight Vietnam must hold the center of our attention, but across the world problems and opportunities crowd in on the American Nation. I will discuss them fully in the months to come, and I will follow the five continuing lines of policy that America has followed under its last four Presidents. Tonight I can tell you that we are strong enough to keep all of our commitments. We will need expenditures of $58.3 billion for the next fiscal year to maintain this necessary defense might. While special Vietnam expenditures for the next fiscal year are estimated to increase by $5.8 billion, I can tell you that all the other expenditures put together in the entire Federal budget will rise this coming year by only $.6 billion. This is true because of the stringent cost-conscious economy program inaugurated in the Defense Department, and followed by the other departments of Government. A second principle of policy is the effort to control, and to reduce, and to ultimately eliminate the modern engines of destruction. We will vigorously pursue existing proposals-and seek new ones to control arms and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. A third major principle of our foreign policy is to help build those associations of nations which reflect the opportunities and the necessities of the modern world.

From the Marshall plan to this very moment tonight, that policy has rested on the claims of compassion, and the certain knowledge that only a people advancing in expectation will build secure and peaceful lands. This year I propose major new directions in our program of foreign assistance to help those countries who will help themselves. We will conduct a worldwide attack on the problems of hunger and disease and ignorance. We will place the matchless skill and the resources of our own great America, in farming and in fertilizers, at the service of those countries committed to develop a modern agriculture. We will aid those who educate the young in other lands, and we will give children in other continents the same head start that we are trying to give our own children. To advance these ends I will propose the International Education Act of 1966. I will also propose the International Health Act of 1966 to strike at disease by a new effort to bring modern skills and knowledge to the uncared-for, those suffering in the world, and by trying to wipe out smallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world during this next decade; to help countries trying to control population growth, by increasing our research and we will earmark funds to help their efforts. In the next year, from our foreign aid sources, we propose to dedicate $1 billion to these efforts, and we call on all who have the means to join us in this work in the world. The fifth and most important principle of our foreign policy is support of national independence the right of each people to govern themselves and to shape their own institutions. For a peaceful world order will be possible only when each country walks the way that it has chosen to walk for itself. We follow this principle by encouraging the end of colonial rule. We follow this principle, abroad as well as at home, by continued hostility to the rule of the many by the few or the oppression of one race by another.

In recent months a number of nations have east out those who would subject them to the ambitions of mainland China. History is on the side of freedom and is on the side of societies shaped from the genius of each people. History does not favor a single system or belief unless force is used to make it so.

They have answered with all the effort that the security and the freedom of this Nation required. And they do again tonight in Vietnam. In the North was an independent Communist government. In the South a people struggled to build a nation, with the friendly help of the United States. There were some in South Vietnam who wished to force Communist rule on their own people. Their hope of success was dim. Then, little more than 6 years ago, North Vietnam decided on conquest. And from that day to this, soldiers and supplies have moved from North to South in a swelling stream that is swallowing the remnants of revolution in aggression. We could leave, abandoning South Vietnam to its attackers and to certain conquest, or we could stay and fight beside the people of South Vietnam. We will stay because a just nation cannot leave to the cruelties of its enemies a people who have staked their lives and independence on America's solemn pledge a pledge which has grown through the commitments of three American ENTITYs. We will stay because in Asia and around the world are countries whose independence rests, in large measure, on confidence in America's word and in America's protection.

A little more than 2 months ago, the Vice President outlined our agenda for civil justice reform before the American Bar Association. That speech unleashed a national debate, a flurry of mail here at the White House, I might add, and some of the best lawyer jokes that I have heard in years. But we are not here today to make an easy hit on lawyers. Frankly, I do not think that the problem rests with lawyers; the problem stems from a legal system that just spun out of control. Sadly, we have become the most litigious society in the world. In order to restore sanity to our civil justice system, the Competitiveness Council that the Vice President chairs has recommended extensive and concrete steps that we can take, starting today, to get our legal system back on track. There is 50 recommendations, and these 50 recommendations include changes in the rules of discovery, adoption in certain areas of the loser pays rule, encouragement of alternative dispute resolution, caps on punitive damages, and changes in the rules and expert evidence to end the use of junk science on the witness stand. I have named only a few of our many recommendations. Some of these proposals require Federal legislation, and we are going to be transmitting that up to the Congress very, very soon. Other proposals require action by the Supreme Court. Today's Executive order will apply most of these recommendations, where possible, to the Federal Government. And I am asking every agency head, many here today, to do everything possible to fully and effectively implement the Executive order. With all that said, let me get to the heart of the matter.

Maybe other countries do not have this problem because every other Western democracy has the loser pays rule in order to discourage senseless lawsuits. Maybe it is because we have most of the world's lawyers here in America. Maybe it is because the pop culture in this country encourages lawsuits. I do not know how many of you watch Hulk Hogan in the movie, but he is got a brand new movie out there, and at one point he asks the bad guys if they are going to beat him up.

And we have got to get something done about it. You see the problem everywhere.

It will be good business for the Government, because every dollar we spend in collection and enforcement will produce $20 or more in revenue. And much more important is the matter of good morals. We are not fighting this war to make millionaires, and certainly we are not going to allow the black market operators or any other racketeers to be in a favored class, when the men in the armed forces, and our citizens generally, are sacrificing so heavily. Yesterday, I acquainted the top officials of the Civil Service Commission with our special tax drive and the necessity for an accelerated program of recruitment. Arrangements have been made with the Civil Service Commission to have placed at every ENTITY discharge center in the United States a qualified recruitment officer from the Civil Service Commission, fully versed in our recruitment requirements, who will steer to us the qualified veterans as they are discharged. The American people understand that sacrifices are necessary. The one thing that might break down their will to keep on to complete victory would be a feeling that a few were profiting from the sacrifices of the many. We must see that there is no justification for any such feeling, and that is just what we are going to do. I think there will be enough discharged veterans, probably, with the qualifications to meet this 10,000-man-program that Mr. Morgenthau is asking for. It is a crime to--a terrible crime, in my opinion, to find these people who are hoarding money and living off the black markets, and things of that sort, when the sons of the rest of the population are out getting killed to save the country. And we are going to try to put a stop to it. I have another short statement I would like to make, with regard to prisoners of war. I wish to express my very deep sympathy for the relatives of those members of our armed forces who have the misfortune still to be held as prisoners of war by the enemy. The welfare of these men is a matter of deep concern to me, and I am determined to do everything possible to help them and to bring about their release as soon as possible.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference370", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-370", "publication_date": "01-06-1945", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S.

On our two trips to Korea, we experienced the great kindness of the Korean people. We hope you have experienced that same feeling from the American people. As you can see from looking around this room, the American people include more than 1 million Korean-Americans who make very strong contributions to the United States but never forget their brothers and sisters half a world away. I recall very well the day in 1992 we first met on the steps of the City Hall in Los Angeles, where we also met with citizens who were starting to rebuild their community after intense racial strife. You spent much of your period of exile in our country, and you have many great friends here, some of whom are with us tonight. They have stood by you through times of trouble, and in turn, you have been a real inspiration to them. Even if the heavens were to crash down, there is a hole through which to rise up; and even if taken in a tiger's teeth, there is a way to survive. Raised on an island with no paved roads or electricity, you were captured by the North Koreans in the war and nearly executed; elected to the national assembly only days before the assembly was disbanded by a coup; denied the Presidency in 1971 after voter intimidation and fraud by the ruling party; injured when a 14-ton truck tried to ram your car; kidnapped, taken to sea, prepared for drowning by Government agents; sentenced to death again in 1981 after a 6-minute trial. Through it all, you never lost hope that democracy and human rights could rise up in your beloved land. Now you are at the center of that democracy working to make the dreams of your people a reality. You are an inspiration, not only to your fellow Koreans but to people all around the world who seek freedom and a better life. Tonight we celebrate your triumphs and the triumph of democracy in so many nations that once were ruled by the iron hand of dictatorship. We also remember with gratitude those who bravely struggled for freedom but gave their lives before their dreams were realized. And we honor those around the world who still struggle to free their countries from tyranny. Their struggles and yours, Mr. President, remind us that we must never take freedom for granted.

{"id": 5557, "text": "In my last radio address, I discussed my decision not to impose quotas or tariffs on footwear imports. Protectionism, I said, costs consumers billions of dollars, damages the overall economy, and destroys jobs. Instead of closing down markets at home and throwing Americans out of work, we should be stepping up our efforts to open markets abroad and create American jobs by increasing exports. I instructed the United States Trade Representative to begin investigations of unfair trading practices on the part of our trading partners. We have the authority to counter unfair trading practices by initiating investigations, entering negotiations, and taking active countermeasures if those negotiations are unsuccessful. one, against a Korean law that prohibits fair competition of U.S. life and fire insurance firms in the Korean market in direct contradiction of treaty obligations; two, against a Brazilian law that has restricted U.S. exports of computers and related products and squeezed out some American computer firms operating there; and three, against restrictive practices dealing with tobacco products in Japan that unfairly block U.S. entry into that market. I have also ordered acceleration of ongoing efforts to open up Japanese markets in leather and leather footwear and to challenge the European Community's subsidies on canned fruit. On these two cases we are setting a deadline of December 1, 1985. I have directed that a list be prepared of countermeasures which will be taken if these disputes are not resolved by then. We hope that through these negotiations we will be able to convince our trading partners to stop their unfair trading practices and open those markets that are now closed to American exports. We will take countermeasures only as a last resort, but our trading partners should not doubt our determination to see international trade conducted fairly with the same rules applicable to all. I am committed to and will continue to fight for fair trade. American exporters and American workers deserve a fair shake abroad, and we intend to see they get it. Our objective will always be to make world trading partnerships freer and fairer for all. So, while we will use our powers as a lever to open closed doors abroad, we will continue to resist protectionist measures that would only raise prices, lock out trade, and destroy the jobs and prosperity trade brings to all. As we take these important steps to make our trading system freer and fairer, let us also look at the subject of trade in its broader context.

I would not be able to report as correctly the views of any one of you. I do not know how you get before the country so clearly and so well my views as you do. And I also want to thank you for the consideration with which you have always treated the Presidential office during the time that I have been President.

I would like to say also that I am very much gratified with the work that the Congress did. The principal thing that will affect the country is the reduction of taxation. I was not able to do a great lot with the reduc-tion of expenditures, but we did keep expenditures down fairly well. There was no bill of general importance that passed that I did not approve. I sent up a couple of veto messages of personal and local significance and there were three or four bills that I decided not to sign. One of them I had not been able to make up my mind about it. That is the bill relative to taxation of lands in Oregon and Washington. That did not come in until just as I was about to leave the office to go to lunch and from lunch to the Capitol, so I did not have a chance to investigate it. I am investigating it now to see whether I ought to approve it or leave it disapproved. The tax measure I would say was the most important piece of legislation. The approval of the World Court and the manifest desire to place that on a basis where its independence would be made more secure than it is now, leaving the other nations to approve that policy, is a matter of importance in international relations.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsexcerptsthepresidentsnewsconference160", "title": "Excerpts of the President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/excerpts-the-presidents-news-conference-160", "publication_date": "06-07-1926", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Calvin Coolidge"], "gender": ["M"]}}

The Lausanne treaty and the treaty relative to the sale of arms and the use of gas did not come up for final consideration. The Railroad Labor Bill will we hope develop into a very important policy, because of the significance of it of leaving the management of the railroads and the employees to agree among themselves with the very manifest disposition of a new desire on their part to harmonize difficulties that may arise and adjust them without the interference of the Government. And of course there is the building law which really represented a new policy of making a lump sum appropriation and leaving the administration of it and the disposition of it to the Secretary of the Treasury. I also believe the Postmaster General comes in on things that are of interest to the Post Office Department. Then the aviation bill was very important, which also is the adoption of a new policy of administration. With the great amount of discussion that had been going on through the summer months in relation to the aviation situation, the present bill is in a very wonderful way, I think, almost in entire harmony with the recommendations made by the Navy Air Board, a considerable step in advance. We passed a bill that had been agreed upon in the fall as a result of conferences between the Secretary of Agriculture and the Cooperative Farm Associations that is of considerable importance for the betterment of the cooperative farm movement in the country. I spoke of the two treaties. Another matter of importance which awaits future action is legislation relative to the licensing of radio plants. I think those are the principal features of this Congress. But the fact remains that no legislation of general import was passed that did not have my approval and in all the main features that I desired to have the Congress act upon I secured favorable action. I happened to express it in that way. I think some of the success of the present Congress was due to the fact that they assumed very largely their own responsibility and undertook to function as an independent legislative body without too much interference on the part of the Executive or too much subservience to the wishes of the Executive. That is I mean, trying to determine questions on their merits. As a result of that policy there was very little of partisanship that was shown in the decision of any large questions. There is another item that I left out, which of course is of tremendous importance, and that is the settlement of our foreign debts.

I was struck by Tim Duncan's comments after the sixth game when they were talking about the fantastic individual effort he had. And a reporter said, What about that effort? He said, It is cool, but then immediately went on to talk about the accomplishments of his teammates, recognizing that you cannot win a championship unless you are able to rely upon others and lift others up and participate with others and work hard with others.

The words which the mayor has uttered have touched me very much and I have been most touched and stimulated by the words which Senor Postorelli has so kindly uttered in behalf of the Government of this great kingdom. It is very delightful to feel my association with that government and with this city. I know how much of the vitality of Italian effort comes out of this great center of industry and of thought. As I passed through your streets I had this sensation, a sensation which I have often had in my own dear country at home-a sensation of friendship and close sympathetic contact. I could have believed myself in an American city. And I felt more than that. I felt, as I have also felt at home, that the real blood of the country flowed there in the street, in the veins of those plain people who more than some of the rest of us have borne the stress and burden of the war. Because think of the price at which you and at which we have purchased the victory which we have won. Think of the price of blood and treasure not only, but the price of tears, the price of hunger on the part of little children, the hopes delayed, the dismay of the prospects, that bore heavy upon the homes of simple people everywhere. That is the price of liberty. Those of us who plan battles, those of us who conceive policies, do not bear the burden of it. We plan and others suffer, and the conquest of spirit is greater than the conquest of arms. These are the people that never let go and say nothing. They merely live from day to day, determined that the glory of Italy or the glory of the United States shall not depart from her. I have been thinking as I have passed through your streets and sat here that this was the place of the labors of the great Cavour, and I have thought how impossible many of the things that have happened in Italy since, how impossible the great achievements of Italy in the last three years, would have been without the work of Cavour.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthephilharmonicclubturinitaly", "title": "Remarks at The Philharmonic Club in Turin, Italy", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-philharmonic-club-turin-italy", "publication_date": "06-01-1919", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Woodrow Wilson"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And I have another thought. Perhaps you gentlemen think of the members of your Government and the members of the other governments who are going to confer now at Paris as the real makers of war and of peace. You are the makers of war and of peace. The pulse of the modern world beats on the farm and in the mine and in the factory. The plans of the modern world are made in the counting house. The men who do the business of the world now shape the destinies of the world, and peace or war is in large measure in the hands of those who conduct the commerce of the world. That is one reason why unless we establish friendships, unless we establish sympathies, we clog all the processes of modern life. As I have several times said, you can not trade with a man who does not trust you, and you will not trade with a man whom you do not trust. Trust is the very life and breadth of business; and suspicion, unjust national rivalry stands in the way of trade, stands in the way of industry. A country is owned and dominated by the capital that is invested in it. I do not need to instruct you gentlemen in that fundamental idea. In proportion as foreign capital comes in among you and takes its hold, in that proportion does foreign influence come in and take its hold. And therefore the processes of capital are in a certain sense the processes of conquest. I have only this to suggest, therefore. We go to Paris to conclude a peace. You stay here to continue it. We start the peace. It is your duty to continue it. We can only make the large conclusions. You constantly transact the details which constitute the processes of the life of nations. And so it is very delightful to me to stand in this company and feel that we are not foreigners to each other. We think the same thoughts. We entertain the same purposes.

{"id": 5626, "text": "What a moment of hope it was 1 year ago when Central American leaders concluded their meeting in Guatemala. The Sandinista Government of Nicaragua, a Communist regime fighting a civil war against 15,000 Nicaraguan freedom fighters opposed to their oppression, agreed to a series of sweeping democratic reforms. If carried out, those reforms would have ended the killing and brought peace to Nicaragua and Central America. It would also have meant that Nicaragua would at last join the family of free, democratic nations. To much media fanfare, the opposition newspaper in Nicaragua, La Prensa, was reopened. A few political prisoners were released, and political groups were allowed more latitude. Most important, Sandinistas finally agreed to the freedom fighters' request for direct negotiations for a peaceful, democratic settlement. Now the main reason the Sandinistas agreed to those steps a year ago was the steady progress of the freedom fighters, including important battlefield victories like the one at Los Minas. But tragically, at the very moment when continued strength and determination by the United States might have meant the continued success of the peace plan, the United States House of Representatives decided, and by only a very narrow margin, to refuse my request for further effective aid to the freedom fighters. This, of course, removed the principal prod-the military victories and popular success of the freedom fighters-to Sandinista participation in the peace plan and sent an immediate signal of American weakness to the Communists. This failure to support the freedom fighters has had costly and sad consequences-just how costly and sad we have seen during the past few weeks. Communist Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega has been visiting Castro in Cuba and voicing solidarity with the tyrant who has brought so much sadness and misery to that country while in Nicaragua , a renewed attack on political dissent is being led by the head of the secret police, Tomas Borge, a dedicated Communist and grim, hardened repressor of human rights whose office, according to our Commission on Organized Crime, has also been actively engaged in the international drug trade. Acting under the orders of the Communist leaders and Borge's supervision, Sandinista police and goon squads have brutally broken up a peaceful demonstration by 3,000 Nicaraguans. Opposition leaders were jailed or beaten and now sentenced to prison.

Poverty and tradition, fear and ignorance, the structure of our society and the workings of our economy, all converge on this enormous wrong which has troubled the American conscience from the beginning. Its just solution is essential, not only to give the full blessings of freedom to Negroes, but to liberate all of us. It will take another hundred years to finish the job. Well, I am here to say to you tonight that I do not agree. Great social change tends to come rapidly in periods of intense activity and progress before the impulse slows. I believe we are in the midst of such a period of change. So, it is our task to carry forward nothing less than the full assimilation of more than 20 million Negroes into American life. This is not to be an assimilation of bland conformity. It is, as it has always been, to allow ready access to every blessing of liberty, while permitting each to keep his sense of identity with a culture and tradition. In this way we enlarge our freedom and we enrich our Nation. We have just passed a milestone in this task. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 extends the protection of the law to many of the demands of justice. This act, of course, is not the whole answer.

The widespread voluntary support, in all parts of the country, of the public accommodation title is proof of the educational value of law, and the great reservoir of good will among Americans. I believe this title, too, will find wide acceptance. It is simple justice that all should share in programs that are financed by all and that are directed by the Government of all the people. They range from the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, the Civil Rights Commission and the President's Committee on Equal Opportunity in Housing to the Community Relations Service, the President's Committee on Equal Opportunity in Employment, and the soon to be created Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Each of these groups has a distinct and a very important mission. Those now in existence have done a difficult task in an impressive way. But really they all aim toward the same general objective. And really they must pursue that objective through cooperation among themselves and with private groups such as the distinguished members of this organization who have helped us so much for so long. As long as I am your President, I want the Government of all of the people to speak with a single voice on this single question. Therefore, I am delighted to tell you tonight that I have asked Vice President-elect Hubert Humphrey, and he has agreed, to assume the responsibility for working with all of these groups, assisting in coordination of their efforts, and helping them to build toward an energetic pursuit of equal opportunity for all people in this Nation. These are some of the steps that we are taking, and there are going to be a good many more. For, as the problem of civil rights has grown in urgency, it has also grown in complexity. We must open the doors of opportunity. We must equip our people to walk through those doors. Thus, programs to eliminate poverty, to improve education, to provide housing by enlarging the opportunities of all Americans assure new opportunities for Negro Americans. There are those who predict that the struggle for full equality in America will be marked by violence and hate; that it will tear at the fabric of our society.

We have met and visited at some length with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the United Kingdom. We have met and discussed the problems of free men in southeast Asia. We have reviewed the lot of the people on the continent of Africa, and particularly the Congo. But in each and every one of these studies, we have tried to put the interest of the individual and the dignity of the person first and foremost in our minds. In a doubtful period in 1957, 85 years since the Congress acted on the subject of civil rights and protecting the constitutional rights of all of our people, I sat down with the leaders of the Urban League, and with their guidance and with their help and with their support, for the first time in 85 years, we passed the first Civil Rights Act through the Congress of the United States. We were just learning to walk, but by 1960 it was possible for us to implement that statute and to contribute some constructive improvements. Then, a new administration came to power in 1961 and at the end of 4 years we had passed the most comprehensive legislation-and signed it--ever to be put on our statute books in this field. Now, the lights are still on in the White House tonight--preparing programs that will keep our country up with the times, and it will keep our feet on the ground. We have a Great Society. We do not have to begin one; we just have to keep it, retain it, improve it, and develop it. We know that the education of our citizens, the employment of our people, the health of their bodies, the freedom they enjoy, the security that is theirs are all uppermost in the minds of those charged with the responsibility of leadership.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalurbanleaguescommunityactionassembly", "title": "Remarks at the National Urban League's Community Action Assembly", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-urban-leagues-community-action-assembly", "publication_date": "10-12-1964", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Lyndon B.

There is just one thing I want to say to you. I want to thank each and every one of you who has spent an hour or a dollar with the Urban League, because it is through efforts that you have made and others like you that the shackles of bondage have been removed from your fellow man.

You know I have been watching the polls pretty closely here of late. And as you might imagine, I like some of them quite a lot more than I like others. The ones I like best are those that like me best. But in this era in which we are living, I was not too sure of their credibility--so the other day I just went out and had a poll of my own made. If President Johnson were to run against the following nationally known Republican leaders, who would you vote for? Then we added another picture that would involve the entire ticket. The second pairing dealt with the ticket of both President and Vice President. Once again I am happy to report that I think we did very well under the circumstances. I think I should tell you that we circulated our poll among leading editors throughout the country--and other experts. One telegram I remember came in from a very important national magazine. Congratulations, Mr. President, on a very fine and well conducted poll. A President, of course, sees a great many expressions of public opinion. The earth is degenerating these days. Children no longer mind parents. Every man wants to write a book and it is evident that the end of the world is approaching fast. Later I discovered that, whoever he was, he wrote what he had to say on an Assyrian tablet almost 5,000 years ago. You do not have to look far to see the same kind of thing today--much of it is directed at the man in the kitchen that President Harry Truman talked about. Some people think we are spending too much, and some think we are not spending enough. Some people think we should not raise taxes, and some think we should have raised them last year. Some think that we are not doing enough for the people in need, and some think we have done too much already. Some think we should escalate the war in Vietnam, and some think we should get out of there tomorrow.

In the 1960's, America, under Democratic leadership, has faced up to the poverty and discrimination in its midst. It has not yet mastered them. But it has started--started on the road toward mastery--toward healing and educating and training and employing those whom life was passing by. This party, and the programs it has inspired and legislated and turned into action, has set a standard in the 1960's by which every administration that follows must be judged. poverty must be abolished, --a good education must be the birthright of every child, --our cities must be made fit for a free people, --the environment must be cleansed and protected for every family, --our streets must be made safe for law-abiding citizens, and --basic human rights must be made real for every man and woman among us.

Every State in the Union is represented in this hall tonight. You are making it possible for the party that believes in building to take its case to the people--to tell them what we promised to do on that August evening in 1964 at Atlantic City we have done--and that America is a richer and a stronger and a fairer Nation today because Democrats made it so. Our party and our country is greater than any of us. It is entitled to the best from all of us. As for myself, my first and last business is trying to win and trying to secure the peace. That task will take all that I have--and I shall give it gladly. So tonight I tell you that I will work as hard as any man can work for his country, and I will do everything in my power to build a record for our Democratic Party that America will enthusiastically embrace 13 months from now.

I live every day with the responsibilities it entails--with those our country bears, because it is the strongest and it is the freest of all nations--and also with those that I bear, because of the office I hold. If I may, let me speak quite personally to you for a moment. I have--as you know--spent my entire life in the political arena. I treasure the support of our people. I treasure that support as much, I think, as any man could. by softening or renouncing the struggle in Vietnam, or escalating it to the red line of danger, --by giving in and retreating on the tax proposal, --by abandoning the fight against discrimination--the fight for the poor-- here at home. Some may say there is short term political gain for me, and for our party, if we could follow this kind of a course. It would mean, in my opinion, greatly increasing the chances of a major war--not this year, but in the years immediately ahead. It would mean imposing a far more onerous tax, a tax of inflation, on all of our people--and the poorest among us--not just this year, but next year. It would mean dooming our cities to angry strife and squalor--in every year yet to come. So we do have a choice. We can take the easy road tonight, denying our responsibilities, hoping that a rise in our polls will compensate for what we ought to have done for our country. Or we can take the harder road of responsibility. We can do what we believe is right for our children's future, though it may mean a great deal of present pain. Well, I have made my choice.

I told someone to take a picture of that, and I am going to take it back to the Vice President when I see him this afternoon and suggest that we both take flying lessons. Admiral Miller said, You understand on that plane, you would still control the eject seat. And I told him, I do not believe in ejecting. But I was glad to know that. I thank you all for your service. I am pleased and honored to be with you today. I understand that some of you have actually chosen to come back from your leave to be a part of this ceremony, and I am deeply grateful for yet another expression of your devotion to your country. I am proud of the job you have done, proud of the great work that all of our troops are doing in Haiti. And on behalf of the American people, the most important message I have to you today is a simple, straightforward, heartfelt thank you. I also want to thank, especially, Captain Gemmill and the crew of this magnificent carrier for the I Like Ike button. But obviously, I was an infant; I did not have much consciousness of it. President Eisenhower was elected in the year I went to the first grade, so he was the first President I really ever knew anything about. And all of us, regardless of our party, liked Ike. I can still remember when the country was united in a way that it is not now and when political arguments were a little more civil than they tend to be now. President Eisenhower's life of service to our country and his incredible leadership throughout his military career, culminating in his leadership in World War II and of course ultimately in his election to the Presidency, was an inspiration to me and to every other young American and I know is a continuing inspiration to all of you who are privileged to serve on this great carrier and in this group.

The stories from Port-au-Prince and elsewhere in Haiti have inspired all Americans. We have seen the moving images of Haitians approaching and thanking American troops for their new-found freedom. We have seen the joy in their eyes and the hope in their faces. Operation Uphold Democracy is not over yet, and you know well that it still presents dangers to the men and women of our Armed Forces. But look what has happened in less than 3 weeks. In less than 3 weeks, you have disarmed FRAPH, the attaches, and the other militia who terrorized thousands of Haitians. In less than 3 weeks, you took heavy weapons away from the military and made the cities and the towns more secure. In less than 3 weeks, you helped 1,900 refugees return home from Guantanamo, no longer afraid for their lives. In less than 3 weeks, you permitted Parliament once again to open its doors for business. And today, they are having a good, old-fashioned debate down there, about like what happens in Congress every day in Washington. In less than 3 weeks, you returned Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul, a man in hiding in his own country for 3 years, back to his office. In less than 3 weeks, you put state radio and television back into the hands of people who want democracy. In less than 3 weeks, you even turned the lights back on in Cap Haitien after 2 years of darkness. In less than 3 weeks, you showed the world what the men and women of the American military can do. All of us owe these achievements to the fact that you are the best trained, best prepared, best equipped, most highly motivated fighting force in the world. Your reputation preceded you to Haiti.

In its place, and within just hours of reaching agreement with Mr. Cedras and the other military leaders, we sent in troops, carried by the Eisenhower Battle Group, to keep the peace in Haiti. Operation Uphold Democracy demonstrates the value of mixing our four services together and drawing on the special capabilities of each of them, what Admiral Miller calls adaptive force packaging. You prepared the first-ever infantry air assault from a carrier. Had it not been for such innovation, it would have taken many more hours, if not days, for our troops to be on the ground there. I salute Admiral Miller and the members of his staff who developed this innovative plan, which will change our military planning and make it possible for us to do remarkable things well into the 21st century. You have laid the groundwork for a dramatic forward movement in a military planning and execution. You should be proud, and the Nation owes Admiral Miller and his staff a great deal. Of course, even the best strategists can only make a difference if they have the resources to do the job. That is why I was pleased yesterday to sign the fiscal year '95 defense authorization bill, which was passed with strong bipartisan support including the support of Virginia's two fine Senators, Chuck Robb and John Warner, and the two able Congressmen from this area, Norm Sisisky and Bobby Scott. This bill will assure that you remain better trained, better equipped, and better prepared than any other military in the world, and I am determined that it will always be that way. I know that one piece of this defense bill will be especially welcome news for all of you, the $3.6 billion we will spend on a new aircraft carrier, CVN-76. That carrier will be built right here in Norfolk by thousands of hard-working Virginians. Like the Eisenhower, it will give us the capability to project our power around the world, to support peacekeeping and humanitarian relief missions, and, if necessary, to fight and to win regional conflicts.

And I commend all of you individually for your wonderful work in helping our rural communities. It is gratifying to me to see young people like yourselves volunteering your time to keep these communities strong. And everything you have done, including Care and Share and working with local churches and various groups and other private sector initiatives, is indispensable to the future of our farm communities. I want you to know that I have been thinking about the problems of the farm these past few years. In fact, we are , all of us here in this big house, constantly concerned about the challenges faced by American farmers during these difficult days. The American farmer not only feeds this country that is 238 million strong, the American farmer feeds the world. And so when we contemplate the problems farmers are facing these days, we realize that we are dealing with a problem that speaks to the heart of how America lives and what America is. A while back I received a letter from a daughter of a farmer in Louisiana. She wrote of how she remembered her father-up at last light, no time for breakfast, out milking the cows, gathering eggs, feeding the dogs. She spoke of how always in a farmer's day something will break down, and her father would have to fix it. And then he would hit the fields with the tractor and the earth tiller, and he would not mind because a farmer is part of the ground he works. Do not you think it is time to say thanks to the farmer? After all, you stick your feet under his table every day. Well, those are wonderful words, and they shine with truth. But we do thank the farmer. And when you go home, will you tell your parents how we feel? We have been trying to encourage a national farm bill that will help the farmer and ensure that you have a future in farming by making American agriculture more competitive.

It is been wonderful to have you here, and I thank you all for coming. I'd like to just add something here. You know, about 135 years ago a Frenchman came to this country because this country had already become the great economic powerhouse that it has continued to be. His name was Alexis de Tocqueville, and he toured all over this country, as he said, looking for the secret of our greatness. And he told some wonderful things. We are pretty unique in all the world with things like you, yourselves, are doing volunteer programs where people set out to help others, to help their neighbors. And he described it as how, he said, a man would see a problem, and he would not call the Government. He'd cross the street and talk to a friend, and pretty soon a committee would be formed. And, he said, they would solve the problem. And then in his book to his own countrymen in France, he said, and you will not believe this, but there would not be a bureaucracy involved at any time in solving that problem. But he found the secret of America, and he also put this in his book. He said he had looked in the busy harbors; he'd looked in our industrial cities; he'd looked all over for the secret of our greatness. And then he said he looked in our churches, and he heard our pulpits aflame with righteousness. Well, I have taken more than my time here because I have got to get in Marine One out there on the South Lawn in just a few minutes and head off for New Hampshire with some of our people and talk to the people up there.

In those 3 days I have visited New York City and then on to Illinois, at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield, and then Idaho Falls in Idaho, the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, Dallas for the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and finally, today, Loma Linda, California. I can only say that after seeing this great country of ours, and hundreds of thousands of people, it is really good to be home in California, here at Loma Linda. I know that represented in this audience are a number of Californians, and a number from all parts of the country, because one of the greatnesses of California is that we come from all the States of the Nation and from most of the nations of the world. On this occasion, I would like to direct my remarks to the double purpose of the announcement that we are making today. The first is with regard to the hospital that Governor Reagan referred to that was destroyed in the earthquake of February 9. That was a hospital located in one of the most beautiful areas of southern California, on the tip of the San Fernando Valley. It no longer, of course, can be used, and it should not be rebuilt. Consequently, we are replacing it here, but not only replacing it, but making a bigger hospital and a better hospital than we had before, right here in Loma Linda. What do we do with the land that we had? Here we have a policy which, in our Administration, we are implementing on a broad scale across the country. The Federal Government, for example, owns 45 percent of all the land in the State of California. We own land all over this country that the Federal Government does not need, land that could be better used by the States, by the counties, by the people of this country. So, under these circumstances, with regard to the 94 acres in the San Fernando Valley, we are declaring it surplus through the cooperation of the Veterans Administration, so that it can be made into a park, a park which will be available to the people in that area and all the people of southern California.

But I also know, and you know, that while millions of Americans are fortunate enough to be able to afford the time and the money to go to one of those great parks located mostly in the western part of the United States, the great majority of Americans, and particularly of American young people, never see one. They live in the cities. This is their home, and what we must do is to bring the parks to the people. That is what we are doing through this program. Governor, we know that whether it is the beach at San Clemente, which we declared surplus so that we can have a wonderful surfing beach down there that now can be used, or whether it is this 94 acres, that you, in cooperation with the city and county, will make good use of this land for the people of the State of California as they want it to be used. Now, let me turn to this great hospital, and to say something about it and those who administer it that I think needs to be recognized, and particularly should be recognized by ENTITY. Reference was made by the Mayor 1 in his remarks that in 1953 he got an autograph from me. At that time I had just become Vice President of the United States. And that same year, 1953, 18 years ago, I really learned what the people who have built Loma Linda University, what the Seventh Day Adventists, do, not only in America, because I visited Loma Linda University--it was then Loma Linda College, as I recall, in 1950--but I learned what they are doing in the world, because in that year, 1953, Mrs. Nixon and I took a trip clear around the world. 1 Douglas F. Welebir was mayor of Loma Linda. As we visited the countries of Southeast Asia and Southern Asia, we saw several hospitals run by various organizations. The most impressive ones were the ones run by the Seventh Day Adventists, people who were dedicated. There were doctors, there were nurses, there were others who were giving their lives for the purpose of helping those people in those poor countries develop a better system of medicine.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkslomalindauniversitylomalindacalifornia", "title": "Remarks at Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-loma-linda-university-loma-linda-california", "publication_date": "20-08-1971", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Richard Nixon"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Now a word as to what this hospital will mean. First, to the veterans it means better care, because this will be a great hospital, I can assure you. A hospital is not just a magnificent building like this splendid building, but what really counts in a hospital is the dedication of the doctors and the nurses and the others. And I can assure you this hospital will have the most dedicated doctors, nurses, and personnel we can possibly find, and our veterans will benefit from that. The second thing I think is important to note is that all the community, all the Nation will benefit, because as Don Johnson, our Veterans Administrator, has often pointed out, and as he was telling me coming out on the plane from Dallas the other day, the work that is done in veterans hospitals makes breakthroughs that benefit all the country. For example, the treatment of so-called tropical diseases breakthroughs have been made already as a result of the work that has been done in the very difficult war in which we are presently engaged that we did not think was possible even in World War II, and more will come. So we see this hospital benefiting, as it should, first the veterans and providing better care for them, but beyond that, providing a basis for training for doctors, nurses, and others, and the basis for research which will improve the health of all the country; and then beyond that, as I have indicated, contributing to better health for all the people of the world. So I am sure you can understand why all of us at this very moment, as we make this announcement, can realize that this is an announcement that everybody can support. Without regard to party, we are all for good health. Without regard to party, we are all for better relations between nations. Without regard to party, thinking as Americans, we want to do everything that we can to help those veterans who have served our country, who have made sacrifices that we did not make ourselves.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkslomalindauniversitylomalindacalifornia", "title": "Remarks at Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-loma-linda-university-loma-linda-california", "publication_date": "20-08-1971", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Richard Nixon"], "gender": ["M"]}}

In that spirit, could I add just a word to the very eloquent remarks of Governor Reagan? As one travels across this country, he thinks of numbers of things. As you go from New York to Illinois, to Idaho, to Wyoming, to Texas, and then out to California, you realize this is a very big country. But also, despite what may be said and heard at tunes running America down, you realize America is a beautiful country. They are a people who have gone to war four times in this century, but to our credit, never for the purpose of destroying freedom, always for the purpose of defending it; never for the purpose of breaking the peace, only for the purpose of keeping it. America is the strongest nation in the world today; but why? a whole generation of peace--something we Americans have not had in a century. Americans are for it. Americans support it. And as we look toward that goal, and particularly as we see in this audience those who have given so much to their country, I say let us be worthy of them, worthy of the sacrifices of war by building a peace, a real peace, so that their sons and their children will not have to fight in another war, if that can be made possible. And second, to build a nation and a period of peace that means something more than simply the absence of war, that means a nation that has confidence in itself, a people that believe in this country, a people who are willing to make sacrifices for their country if they realize that what they give up is going to help all the country and all the people, and a people, also, who, as was the case in the beginning of this country, will recognize that America has a role in the world, and we are going to fulfill it. You remember 195 years ago when America was a poor nation, when it was a weak nation, Thomas Jefferson said, we act not just for ourselves, but for the whole human race. But it was true then, because he knew that wealth and power was not what made a people great; it was the spirit of the people, and we had a great spirit, the Spirit of '76.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkslomalindauniversitylomalindacalifornia", "title": "Remarks at Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-loma-linda-university-loma-linda-california", "publication_date": "20-08-1971", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Richard Nixon"], "gender": ["M"]}}

He represents the best of America, a man who will always make us proud - my friend and America's next Vice President, Paul Ryan. In the days ahead, you will get to know Paul and Janna better. But last night America got to see what I saw in Paul Ryan - a strong and caring leader who is down to earth and confident in the challenge this moment demands. I love the way he lights up around his kids and how he is not embarrassed to show the world how much he loves his mom. But Paul, I still like the playlist on my iPod better than yours. Four years ago, I know that many Americans felt a fresh excitement about the possibilities of a new president. That president was not the choice of our party but Americans always come together after elections. We are a good and generous people who are united by so much more than what divides us. When that hard fought election was over, when the yard signs came down and the television commercials finally came off the air, Americans were eager to go back to work, to live our lives the way Americans always have - optimistic and positive and confident in the future. It is what brought us to America. We are a nation of immigrants. We are the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the ones who wanted a better life, the driven ones, the ones who woke up at night hearing that voice telling them that life in that place called America could be better. They came not just in pursuit of the riches of this world but for the richness of this life. This is the essence of the American experience. We Americans have always felt a special kinship with the future. When every new wave of immigrants looked up and saw the Statue of Liberty, or knelt down and kissed the shores of freedom just ninety miles from Castro's tyranny, these new Americans surely had many questions. But none doubted that here in America they could build a better life, that in America their children would be more blessed than they.

Tonight that American flag is still there on the moon. that unique blend of optimism, humility and the utter confidence that when the world needs someone to do the really big stuff, you need an American. My dad had been born in Mexico and his family had to leave during the Mexican revolution. I grew up with stories of his family being fed by the US Government as war refugees. My dad never made it through college and apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter. And he had big dreams. He convinced my mom, a beautiful young actress, to give up Hollywood to marry him. He moved to Detroit, led a great automobile company and became Governor of the Great State of Michigan. We were Mormons and growing up in Michigan; that might have seemed unusual or out of place but I really do not remember it that way. My friends cared more about what sports teams we followed than what church we went to. My mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all - the gift of unconditional love. They cared deeply about who we would BE, and much less about what we would DO. Unconditional love is a gift that Ann and I have tried to pass on to our sons and now to our grandchildren. All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. If every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family - and God's love -- this world would be a far more gentle and better place.

That is how she found out what happened on the day my father died - she went looking for him because that morning, there was no rose. My mom and dad were true partners, a life lesson that shaped me by everyday example. When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way.

If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, should not you feel that way now that he is President Obama? You know there is something wrong with the kind of job he is done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him. The President has not disappointed you because he wanted to. The President has disappointed America because he has not led America in the right direction. He took office without the basic qualification that most Americans have and one that was essential to his task. He had almost no experience working in a business. Jobs to him are about government. I learned the real lessons about how America works from experience. When I was 37, I helped start a small company. My partners and I had been working for a company that was in the business of helping other businesses. So some of us had this idea that if we really believed our advice was helping companies, we should invest in companies. We should bet on ourselves and on our advice. So we started a new business called Bain Capital. The only problem was, while WE believed in ourselves, nobody else did.

Every year, assaults and illness and suicide take the lives of about 5,000 runaways. The threats to our children are found not just on the streets, but they are found on the technology which we use in our homes. The Internet is a wonderful tool for our children to broaden their knowledge, expand their minds, but the evils of the world have crept into the Internet. In 1 year alone, one in five children between the ages of 10 and 17 received a sexual solicitation over the Internet. With expanding use of the Internet and the heightened activity of predators searching for underage victims, more children are being lured into harmful and even tragic situations. In every region in the world, children can be vulnerable, not just here at home but children everywhere. Each year, about a million girls and boys are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. Such trafficking is nothing less than a modern form of slavery, an unspeakable and unforgivable crime against the most vulnerable members of the global society. All these dangers put children at risk. All these dangers demand action to protect our children from harm. The Justice Department has made the prevention and investigation of child abductions a major priority. We are providing State and local authorities with access to fingerprint records and forensic experts and training on missing-children cases. We want the local authorities to have the best available technologies and skills in order to respond quickly. The Department sponsors a 24-hour hotline for reporting missing children, which is operated by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. We are waging a nationwide effort to prevent use of the Internet to sexually exploit children.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthewhitehouseconferencemissingexploitedandrunawaychildren", "title": "Remarks at the White House Conference on Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-white-house-conference-missing-exploited-and-runaway-children", "publication_date": "02-10-2002", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

I am pleased that the House of Representatives passed the Child Obscenity and Pornography Prevention Act this year to revise and strengthen our pornography laws. The Senate needs to work with the House to get legislation done before they go home. We need to do everything we can to protect our children from the evils of pornography. We will not forget the suffering and struggles of America's runaway children. The Federal Government supports hundreds of emergency shelters and programs that reach out to young people living on the street, offering them food and comfort and counseling. These programs are mainly administered by community and faith-based groups. After all, it is in our faith-based community where we hear that universal call to love a neighbor just like you'd like to be loved yourself. It is in our faith-based groups that we find deep compassion to help those in need and who are troubled. And many of the runaway kids are troubled and in deep need of love. And these children are vulnerable; they are vulnerable to exploitation. There are some great programs in America, people who are soldiers in the armies of compassion, one of which is the Covenant House. We are honored today to have Sister Mary Rose McGeady here. She runs the Covenant House. And if you do not know anything about the Covenant House and if you are interested in helping, support the Covenant House or programs like the Covenant House, because these people help those on the street, those young, vulnerable children on the street, to realize there is love in our society and there is hope for a better way. On the international front, the United States is acting vigorously against the trafficking of young people. Last February, I established an Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. The task force is working hard to prosecute traffickers, protect victims, and prevent future trafficking. The past year alone, the Department of Justice prosecuted four times as many traffickers as it did 2 years ago. We are making progress. We have got to continue to work with our friends and allies to prevent this scourge from not only spreading but to stop it.

{"id": 5698, "text": "The responsibility to protect America's children is shared throughout our society by government at every level and by parents in every home. Parents, of course, are the first line of defense against danger. To help our parents protect their children, the Department of Education has distributed a new guidebook providing practical steps that parents can take to make their children safer, practical steps that make it clear about how a parent needs to deal with their child about the dangers facing children. And this information, you will be pleased to hear, is written in ways so that the children can actually understand what is on the page. The book tells mothers and fathers how to rehearse with their children what to say or do if they ever feel threatened. It is a practical guide to explain to children how to deal with predators that are smooth and seductive, how to deal with somebody that is a stranger that sounds sweet-talking but may in their heart be dark and dangerous for our children. The book also lists web sites that provide information about protecting children. Parents need to pay as much attention to their children, by the way, when they are on the Internet as when they are on a playground. They have got to know what their children are doing on the Internet. They have got to know with whom they are conversing. We are passing it out to the Nation's schools, and the schools will then make it available to parents. And as well, parents can request a copy of the guidebook, a practical go-by as to how to train your children how to deal with potential danger. And you can find it on missingkids.com. If you are interested, if you want a practical go-by, call up missingkids.com on the Internet, and you will get some practical steps as to how to help your children avoid danger. Sometimes, in spite of a family's best effort, the unthinkable does happen, and that is really sad. It breaks my heart to know that that continues to happen in America. At that point, the parents need the sup-port-when their child is abducted, the parents need immediate support of their communities, quick action to find their children. Time is of the essence. One of the most successful programs to locate abducted children is what is called the AMBER Plan. It is a voluntary partnership through which police and local broadcasters issue urgent bulletins to the public as soon as a child is missing.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthewhitehouseconferencemissingexploitedandrunawaychildren", "title": "Remarks at the White House Conference on Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-white-house-conference-missing-exploited-and-runaway-children", "publication_date": "02-10-2002", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

My friend State Senator Florence Shapiro is with us-I believe, one of the panelists. She helped launch the AMBER program. I know that it makes her feel really good to know that AMBER, when in place, can really help people, just like it helped Sharon Brooks and her 16-yearold daughter, Tamara. This summer, Tamara and Jacqueline were abducted at gunpoint in Lancaster, California. Tamara told us her story. The police issued an AMBER Alert within hours and soon received tips that led to their rescue. People all across America shared a great feeling of relief when she and her buddy were rescued. One of the reasons they were is because of the AMBER Plan. There are gaps in the AMBER Plan coverage which must be filled, and we can fill them. We will develop more AMBER Plans and better coordination among plans. We should not allow another day to go by without taking steps to expand the AMBER Plan's reach all across our country. And so the Attorney General today is appointing an AMBER Alert Coordinator to help State and local officials develop, enhance, and coordinate AMBER Plans all across America. The Department of Justice will establish standards for the issuance and dissemination of alerts. The Justice and Transportation Departments will take immediate action to provide a total of $10 million to improve the growing network of AMBER Plans. We want AMBER Plan Alerts to be issued as quickly and as effectively as possible, including electronic billboards along the Nation's highways. I support legislation passed by Senator Hutchison of Texas and Senator Feinstein of California to achieve the goals I just outlined and codify them in law. And I want to thank you both for your hard work. And that is why I have just laid out the initiative. If possible, it would be very helpful if the House passed the Hutchison-Feinstein law before they go home. I also am pleased that good corporate citizens are involved with helping our children. And I particularly want to point out Toys R Us or Wal-Mart, Home Depot, as well as Ford Motor dealerships, which are providing free child photo IDs, so that parents can provide law enforcement with sharply focused head-and-shoulder pictures along with relevant biological information in the event of emergency.

I do want to thank you also for the kind of support and assistance that all of you have given. Without this kind of aid, cooperation, we could not be in this ball game and in the situation where we are today--where from all the reports I get, our chances are very good. Now, let me, if I might, take just a minute to give you the message as I see it, which I think epitomizes the last 21 months and which is the foundation from which, in my judgment, we have built for another good 4 years. If you would refresh your memories just a little, back to August of 1974, and then see what has transpired in the last 21 months, I think a person can say that there has been a record of peace, prosperity, and trust established. You know, in 1974 this country was going through great trauma as far as the economy was concerned. We have cut it, for the first 3 months of this year, down to under 3 percent. And the news we got yesterday about the Wholesale Price Index was one that we could have anticipated; you cannot always, in this situation, get every one of them as good as they have been the last 5 months. But the prospects overall, the trend as far as inflation is concerned is good, and it is going to stay on the decline. But if you look at the problems concerning the economy jobwise, we got some excellent news today. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of Labor announced that in the month of April we had 700,000 more people on payrolls in this country, up to a total of 87,400,000--by far, the most employed in the history of the United States. So, I think a person can talk to his neighbor, to his partner, to his business associates, to anybody, and say that in the 21 months, we have taken this country through a tough, tough time by the right policies, by keeping our cool, beating the Congress over its head with 40 vetoes that have been sustained, where we have saved over $13 billion. It was not easy, believe me.

And obviously, one of the triggers of the financial crisis and now the economic crisis that we have suffered is that because in some areas housing got--housing values got way overheated, in some cases you had a lack of regulation that allowed all sorts of complex financial instruments take advantage of homeowners. We have seen a collapse in the housing market, a precipitous drop in values, and that led to a lot of the problems in the financial markets. At the beginning of this administration, we said we are--we were going to tackle directly the problems that homeowners were experiencing and figure out ways in which we could provide them assistance in reducing their interest rates, modifying their loans so that they would be in a position to stay in their homes and reduce their monthly payments. And around the table here you see some wonderful families who have taken advantage of what are now historically low mortgage rates, brought about in part by some extraordinary actions by the Federal Reserve, but also brought about by the housing plan that Tim Geithner and Shaun Donovanhelped to design. What you have seen now is rates are as low as they have been since 1971. Three-quarters of the American people get their mortgages through a Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac qualified loan. And as a consequence of us being able to reduce the interest rates that are available, we have now seen some extraordinary jumps in the rate of mortgage refinancings. And everybody here represents families who have saved hundreds of dollars a month, thousands of dollars a year in some cases, and that is money directly in their pocket. More importantly, what it is allowed them to do is to consolidate their loans in some cases, reduce the length of their mortgages in other cases. It has given them the kind of security and stability in their mortgage payments that a lot more people can take advantage of.

We have seen Fannie Mae refinance $77 billion of mortgages in March, which is their highest volume in one month since 2003. And rates on 30-year mortgages have dropped to an alltime low of 4.78 percent. So we are at a time where people can really take advantage of this.

And the way the web site is designed, you can plug in your information and immediately find out whether or not you are potentially eligible for one of these mortgage refinancings. Now, we are in the process of rolling out some additional phases to the program. Everybody here represent responsible homeowners who made their payments, who have jobs and income that support their mortgages. In some cases, people may have had difficulties because they lost a job, somebody in their family got sick, they may have missed some payments. And in those cases we also want to be helpful, and we are putting in place a loan modification program, working with banks, working with services, that will allow other folks who are closer to losing their home in a stronger position in the future. So there are a range of different programs that are available for a range of different types of borrowers. The main message we want to send today is, is that the programs that have been put in place can help responsible folks who have been making their payments, who are not looking for a handout, but this allows them to make some changes that will leave money in their pockets and leave them more secure in their homes.

This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself-nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days. In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things. Values have shrunken to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our ability to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their produce; the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone. More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment. Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by no plague of locusts. Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily this is because rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.

They know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish. The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit. Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow men. Recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit; and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing. Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, on unselfish performance; without them it cannot live. Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This Nation asks for action, and action now. Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources. Hand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land.

I bring you the best wishes and heartfelt greetings from your American counterparts, the Congress of the United States. One cannot stand in this chamber without feeling a part of your proud history of nationhood and democracy, and the spirit of hope carrying the dreams of your free people. Of all the strengths we possess, of all the ties that bind us, I believe the greatest is our dedication to freedom. Japan and America stand at the forefront of the free nations and free economies in the world. Yes, we are 5,000 miles apart; yes, we are distinctly different in customs, language, and tradition; and yes, we are often competitors in the world markets. But I believe the people represented by this proud parliament and by my own United States Congress are of one heart in their devotion to the principles of our free societies.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressbeforethejapanesediettokyo", "title": "Address Before the Japanese Diet in Tokyo", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-before-the-japanese-diet-tokyo", "publication_date": "11-11-1983", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

America and Japan are situated far apart, but we are united in our belief that freedom means dedication to the dignity, rights, and equality of man. Heaven has made no man higher or no man lower than any other man. No man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent. We both value the right to have a government of our own choosing. We expect government to serve the people; we do not expect the people to serve government. America and Japan speak with different tongues, but both converse, worship, and work with the language of freedom. We defend the right to voice our views, to speak words of dissent without being afraid, and to seek inner peace through communion with our God. We believe in rewarding initiative, savings, and risk-taking. And we encourage those who set their sights on the farthest stars and chart new paths to progress through the winds and waters of commerce. Others censor and stifle their citizens. We trust in freedom to nurture the diversity and creativity that enriches us all. Many kinds of plants and each one triumphant in its special blossoms. Finally, our freedom inspires no fear because it poses no threat. We intimidate no one, and we will not be intimidated by anyone. The United States and Japan do not build walls to keep our people in. We do not have armies of secret police to keep them quiet. We do not throw dissidents into so-called mental hospitals. And we would never cold-bloodedly shoot a defenseless airliner out of the sky. We share your grief for that tragic and needless loss of innocent lives. But in this imperfect and dangerous world, the United States and Japan represent the deepest aspirations of men and women everywhere to be free, to live in peace, and to create and renew the wealth of abundance and spiritual fulfillment. I have come to Japan because we have an historic opportunity, indeed, an historic responsibility.

With our combined economies accounting for half the output of the free world, we cannot escape our global responsibilities. Our industries depend on the importation of energy and minerals from distant lands. Our prosperity requires a sound international financial system and free and open trading markets. And our security is inseparable from the security of our friends and neighbors. The simple hope for world peace and prosperity will not be enough. Our two great nations, working with others, must preserve the values and freedoms our societies have struggled so hard to achieve. Nor should our partnership for peace, prosperity, and freedom be considered a quest for competing goals. And we will not succeed in any of these endeavors unless Japan and America work in harmony. I have come to your country carrying the heartfelt desires of America for peace. I know our desires are shared by Prime Minister Nakasone and all of Japan. We are people of peace. We understand the terrible trauma of human suffering. I have lived through four wars in' my lifetime. So, I speak not just as President of the United States, but also as a husband, a father, and as a grandfather. I believe there can be only one policy for preserving our precious civilization in this modern age. The only value in possessing nuclear weapons is to make sure they cannot be used ever. I know I speak for people everywhere when I say our dream is to see the day when nuclear weapons will be banished from the face of the Earth. Arms control must mean arms reductions. America is doing its part. As I pledged to the United Nations less than 2 months ago, the United States will accept any equitable, verifiable agreement that stabilizes forces at lower levels than currently exist. We want significant reductions, and we are willing to compromise. In the strategic arms reduction talks, American negotiators continue to press the Soviet Union for any formula that will achieve these objectives. In the longer range INF talks, we are pursuing the same course, even offering to eliminate an entire category of weapons. I am very conscious of our negotiating responsibility on issues that concern the safety and well-being of the Japanese people. We must not and we will not accept any agreement that transfers the threat of longer range nuclear missiles from Europe to Asia.

In our good-faith effort to move the negotiations forward, we have offered new initiatives, provided for substantial reductions to equal levels, and the lower the level the better. We still wait for the first positive response. Despite this bleak picture, I will not be deterred in my search for a breakthrough. The United States will never walk away from the negotiating table. We live in uncertain times. There are trials and tests for freedom wherever freedom stands. It is as stark as the tragedy over the Sea of Japan, when 269 innocent people were killed for the so-called cause of sacred airspace. It is as real as the terrorist attacks last month on the Republic of Korea's leadership in Rangoon and against American and French members of the international peacekeeping force in Beirut. And yes, it is as telling as the stonewalling of our adversaries at the negotiating table, and as their crude attempts to intimidate freedom-loving people everywhere. These threats to peace and freedom underscore the importance of closer cooperation among all nations. You have an old proverb that says, A single arrow is easily broken, but not three in a bunch. The stronger the dedication of Japan, the United States, and our allies to peace through strength, the greater our contributions to building a more secure future will be. The U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security must continue to serve us as the bedrock of our security relationship. Japan will not have to bear the burden of defending freedom alone. We will bear that burden together. The defense of freedom should be a shared burden. We can afford to defend freedom; we cannot afford to lose it. The blessings of your economic miracle, created with the genius of a talented, determined, and dynamic people, can only be protected in the safe harbor of freedom. In the hundred years since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has constantly endeavored to catch up and eventually overtake the more advanced countries of the world. Well, I do not think I will be making headlines when I say, you have not only caught up; in some eases, you have pulled ahead. Come to Japan.

Our country has made great strides in this direction during the last 3 years. We are correcting past mistakes. We have turned the corner from overtaxing, overspending, record interest rates, high inflation, and low growth. The United States is beginning the first stage of a new industrial renaissance, and we are helping pull other nations forward to worldwide recovery. But some in my country still flinch from the need to restrain spending. Under the guise of lowering deficits, they would turn back to policies of higher taxes. They would ignore the lesson of Japan. A look at Japan's postwar history yields two stunning conclusions. Among the major industrialized countries, your tax burden has remained the lowest and your growth and saving rates the highest. Savers in Japan can exempt very large amounts of interest income from taxation. Your taxes on so-called unearned income are low. You have no capital gains tax on securities for investors. And the overwhelming majority of your working people face tax rates dramatically lower than in the other industrial countries, including my own. And incentives for everyone-that is the secret of strong growth for a shining future filled with hope, and opportunities and incentives for growth, not tax increases, is our policy for America. Sometimes I wonder if we should not further our friendship by my sending our Congress here and you coming over and occupying our Capitol Building for a while. Partnership must be a two-way street grounded in mutual trust. Let us always be willing to learn from each other and cooperate together. We have every reason to do so. Our combined economies account for almost 35 percent of the world's entire economic output. Last year Japan took about 10 percent of our total exports, and we bought some 25 percent of yours. Our two-way trade will exceed $60 billion in 1983, more than double the level of just 7 years ago. At the Williamsburg summit last May, the leaders of our industrial democracies pledged to cooperate in rolling back protectionism. My personal commitment to that goal is based on economic principles, old-fashioned common sense, and experience. It was a nightmare called the Great Depression.

And if one partner in the boat shoots a hole in the boat, it does not make much sense for the other partner to shoot another hole in the boat. Some say, yes, and call that getting tough. Well, forgive me, but I call it getting wet all over. Rather than shoot holes, let us work together to plug them up so our boat of free markets and free trade and fair trade can lead us all to greater economic growth and international stability. I have vigorously opposed quick fixes of protectionism in America. Anticompetitive legislation like the local content rule, which would force our domestic manufacturers of cars to use a rising share of U.S. labor and parts now, this would be a cruel hoax. It would be raising prices without protecting jobs. We would buy less from you. You would buy less from us. It is not easy for elected officials to balance the concerns of constituents with the greater interests of the Nation, but that is what our jobs are all about. And we need your help in demonstrating free trade to address concerns of my own people. Americans believe your markets are less open than ours. We need your support to lower further the barriers that still make it difficult for some American products to enter your markets easily. Your government's recent series of actions to reduce trade barriers are positive steps in this direction. In turn, I pledge my support to combat protectionist measures in my own country. If we each give a little, we can all gain a lot. As two great and mature democracies, let us have the faith to believe in each other, to draw on our long and good friendship, and to make our partnership grow. We are leaders in the world economy. We and the other industrialized countries share a responsibility to open up capital and trading markets, promote greater investment in each other's country, assist developing nations, and stop the leakage of military technology to an adversary bent on aggression and domination. We believe that the currency of the world's second largest free-market economy should reflect the economic strength and political stability that you enjoy.

It is with those who would impose regimentation over freedom, drudgery over dynamic initiative, a future of despair over the certainty of betterment, and the forced feeding of a military Goliath over a personal stake in the products and progress of tomorrow. You and your neighbors are shining examples for all who seek rapid development. The Pacific Basin represents the most exciting region of economic growth in the world today. Your people stretch your abilities to the limit, and when an entire nation does this, miracles occur. Being a Californian I have seen many miracles hardworking Japanese have brought to our shores. In 1865 a young Samurai student, Kanaye Nagasawa, left Japan to learn what made the West economically strong and technologically advanced. Ten years later he founded a small winery at Santa Rosa, California, called the Fountaingrove Round Barn and Winery. Soon he became known as the grape king of California. Nagasawa came to California to learn and stayed to enrich our lives. Both our countries owe much to this Japanese warrior-turned-businessman. As the years pass, our contacts continue to increase at an astounding rate. Today some 13,000 of your best college and graduate students are studying in America, and increasing numbers of U.S. citizens are coming here to learn everything they can about Japan. Companies like Nissan, Kyocera, Sony, and Toshiba have brought thousands of jobs to America's shores. The State of California is planning to build a rapid speed train that is adapted from your highly successful bullet train. In 1985 the United States will join Japan in a major exhibition of science and technology at Tsukuba, another symbol of our cooperation. For my part, I welcome this new Pacific tide. Let it roll peacefully on, carrying a two-way flow of people and ideas that can break from barriers of suspicion and mistrust and build up bonds of cooperation and shared optimism. Our two nations may spring from separate pasts; we may live at opposite sides of the Earth; but we have been brought together by our indomitable spirit of determination, our love of liberty, and devotion to progress.

Record rain fell in these states and New York recorded more rain yesterday on the first day of September than it usually sees the entire month of September. We saw more than three inches of rain per hour fall in Central Park. The United States National Weather Service issued a flood emergency in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island, and parts of Long Island last night. This is the first time that such a warning has ever been issued for the city. People were trapped in subways with heroic men and women the New York Fire Department rescued all of them, they were trapped. We are seeing the same story of devastation and heroism across New Jersey and Pennsylvania as well. For now, 11 people in New York and New Jersey died because of the storm and I want to express my heartfelt thanks to all the first responders and everyone who is been working through the night and well into the morning to save lives and get power back. There is a lot of damage and I made it clear to the governors that my team at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is on the ground and ready to provide all the assistance that is needed. In fact, our FEMA Director and Administrator, Deanna Griswell, was the chief federal response officer after Superstorm Sandy in 2012, she knows what to do. Last night at the request of California Governor, Newsom, I approved an emergency declaration for California for the counter of fire which is burning aggressively toward Lake Tahoe Basin and in Nevada. And it is also one of the few fires that has ever burned from one side of the stair in Nevada mountain range to the other. So far it is burned more than 200,000 acres. Tens of thousands of people had to evacuate their homes. The fire is threatening close to 35,000 structures and more than 4,400 firefighters from the state and my federal team are working to contain and suppress this raging wildfire.

My thanks is an abundant thanks for what they do. Now, I want to provide an update in our efforts to help millions of Americans down south recover and rebuild from Hurricane Ida. We have been monitoring this hurricane closely and the devastation it is caused. While the catastrophic flooding was not as severe as it was during Hurricane Katrina 16 years ago, Ida was so powerful that it caused the Mississippi River to change direction, the flow, changed the flow temporarily. The good news is that as a result of a significant multi-billion dollar federal investment in the levee system around Metro in New Orleans, it held, it was strong, it worked. But too many people and too many areas are still unprotected and saw a storm surge and flooding that was devastating. We have seen the reports of winds up to 170 miles per hour. It is not been confirmed yet by FEMA, but 170 miles an hour, causing unimaginable damage with debris and down power lines, making roads impassable and slowing response efforts to save folks and property. Now, people continue to shelter-in-place. Tomorrow, I will be traveling to Louisiana to meet with Governor John Bel Edwards as well as the parish presidents and mayors and the local officials representing the effected areas. Governor Edwards encouraged me to come and assured me that my visit will not disrupt recovery efforts on the ground, that is what I wanted to be sure of. My message to everyone affected is we are all in this together, the nation is here to help. That is the message I have been making clear to the mayors, governors, energy and utility leaders in the region who my administration has been working closely with over the past few days. Working with governors in the area, even before Ida made landfall, I issued an emergency declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi to help us respond quickly. positioned more than 4.3 million meals and more than 3 million liters of water and other critical resources in the region before it hit. We deployed more than 250 generators and we are working into getting more into the area, especially the hospitals that desperately need them.

For those who have lost their home, states have been working with the American Red Cross to open almost 50 shelters across the Gulf Coast. We know that there is much to be done in this response on our part. I get hourly updates on the progress from FEMA, well into the night, and we will be working around the clock until the critical needs of the region are fully met and we will meet them. Even as we tackle the core elements of the disaster response, we are also deploying new tools to help speed this recovery, things that have not been used very much in prior hurricane responses. Working with private companies that own and operate the lifeline infrastructure like electricity and communications, we have used the latest technology to accelerate restoration of power and cell phone service. For example, to minimum the amount of time it will take to get the power back to everyone I have directed the federal aviation commission, the FAA, authorize the use of surveillance drones to assess Ida's damage to energy infrastructure while ensuring those slights to not disrupt aerial search and rescue missions. Likewise, I have asked the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy to immediately make available any satellite imagery they can help provide in assessing the extent of the damage. Drones and satellites can make the work faster by getting to the places that are most desperately in need. They can identify where the lines are down, map the damage, help get the transmission lines back up and running in all the parishes. But people, hardworking people, do the complicated and dangerous work. In Alabama two have died on the job. It is important to know that the region hit by Ida is a key center of our nation's oil production and refining infrastructure, that is why we are not waiting to assess the full impact the storm is going to have on oil production and refineries. We are moving already quickly to increase the availability of gas and easing the pressure on gas prices around the country. I have directed the Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, to use all of the tools at her disposal, including using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep gas flowing to the pumps.

In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has approved emergency waivers for Louisiana and Mississippi that will expand the supply of gasoline that can be sold in those states and increase availability at such a critical time. These actions should help reduce the risk of gas shortages and price increases as a result of the hurricane. We also know a lot of people lost cell phone service because their particular carrier's tower went down or got damaged. A few days ago I asked the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, and my White House team to work with the cell phone companies to allow customers to use roaming services, so that means that folks in the area should be able to get a signal no matter what carrier they are up on. If they are one carrier down they can roam and use another carrier they are not part of, they are not signed up with. Just think of the sons and the daughters, moms and dads, and loved ones trying to reach each other and the feeling of fear or maybe something happened and it is just because the cell phones not working.

Today I am calling on insurance companies not to evade the responsibility, to keep the priorities they made to their customers and the promises they made and help some folks who are hurting. Here is the deal, FEMA is providing critical needs assistance, for example, to help the hotel bill you racked up because you could not stay in your home during the hurricane. The Department of Housing and Urban affairs, HUD, is also offering assistance to families in impacted areas, but right now we are hearing reports that some insurance companies may deny coverage for additional living assistance expenses unless the homeowner was under a mandatory evacuation order. People pay their insurance premiums and they are supposed to get payments from their insurance companies for relocation costs, but insurance companies in the face of the strongest storm since 1850 say, No, no, we are not going to pay you what we owe you, because the fact is parishes in Louisiana like Orleans and St. John's issued a voluntary event order at first and may not have even had enough time to make a mandatory one as the storm moved in so fast.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptsjoebidenhurricaneidafederalresponsespeechbriefingtranscriptseptember2", "title": "Joe Biden Hurricane Ida Federal Response Speech Briefing Transcript September 2", "source": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-hurricane-ida-federal-response-speech-briefing-transcript-september-2", "publication_date": "02-09-2021", "crawling_date": "29-06-2023", "politician": ["Joe Biden"], "gender": ["M"]}}

No one, no one fled this killer storm because they were looking for a vacation or a road trip, to be able to stay in a hotel, they left their homes because they felt it was flee or risk death, there is nothing voluntary about that, so I am calling on the private insurance companies right now at this critical moment, do not hide behind the fine print and technicality.

Do the right thing and pay your policy holders what do you owe them to cover the cost of temporary housing in the midst of a natural disaster. Help those in need, that is what all of us need to do.

The people of Louisiana and Mississippi are resilient and resourceful. We are going to stand with you for as long as it takes to recover and allow you to rebuild.

When Congress returns this month I am going to press for their action on my Build Back Better Plan. That is going to make historic investments in electrical infrastructure, modernizing our roads, bridges, our water systems, sewer and draining systems, electric grids and transmission lines and make them more resilient to these superstorms and wildfires, and floods that are going to happen with increasing frequency and ferocity.

You know, we'd originally planned to meet across the street in the White House, but it turned out there was so much interest, we had to find a bigger hall. Now, I know that you have already heard from the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce and a number of others, so I will try to keep my own remarks brief. Given the subject, I would not want anyone to mistake me for a lawyer. But looking out, I can see what a diverse group we make up from Boy Scouts to businessmen, from campers to child-care workers. This is an all-American event, because this problem affects all of America-every man, woman, and child. Originally, of course, tort law protected innocent people against wrongful damage or injury. Rooted in the Middle Ages, tort law became especially important at the onset of the Industrial Revolution, when ordinary men and women began to find themselves presented with services and products they'd never before encountered. By providing consumers with a measure of protection, tort law enabled them to enter this new marketplace with a certain confidence and ease. Back in the days when toothpaste was a newfangled invention, for example, consumers could purchase it with a much greater sense of assurance when they knew that, because of tort law, the manufacturers had to take all reasonable steps to make certain that the product was both effective and safe. Maybe some of you will remember a passage in Huckleberry Finn that deals with this very subject. I'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth, and it does take it off, too, and generally the enamel along with it. [ Twain never mentions tort law, but it is there in the background, the force that kept this character in the book constantly on the run up and down the Mississippi. And in the real world it was, in large part, tort law that reduced such swindlers from an actual presence in our economic life to figures that we remember with laughter. So, over the years, tort law has helped us drive the malevolent and the negligent out of the marketplace. This, in turn, has permitted legitimate economic innovation to take its course and raise living standards throughout the Nation. Twisted and abused, tort law has become a pretext for outrageous legal outcomes outcomes that impede our economic life, not promote it.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmemberstheamericantortreformassociation", "title": "Remarks to Members of the American Tort Reform Association", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-members-the-american-tort-reform-association", "publication_date": "30-05-1986", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

In California, a man was using a public telephone booth to place a call. An alleged drunk driver careened down the street, lost control of her car, and crashed into the phone booth. the telephone company and associated firms. That is right, according to Chief Justice Rose Bird of the California Supreme Court, a jury could find that the companies responsible for the design, location, installation, and maintenance of the telephone booth were liable. In another case, suit was brought by a man who suffered a heart attack while having some trouble starting a lawn mower. He claimed that pulling the starter rope was the cause of the attack. I suppose all this might be amusing if such absurd results only took place occasionally. In the past two decades the number of awards involving a million dollars or more has climbed from just 1 a year to more than 400 a year. Between 1975 and 1985, the average award in a product liability case more than quadrupled, to some $1.8 million. During the same period, the average medical malpractice verdict I said average went up more than 350 percent, to over a million dollars. This expansion of tort liability penalizes virtually every American-manufacturers, doctors, small businessmen, government at all levels, nonprofit organizations, entrepreneurs, and perhaps most severely, the consumer. On one of the Hawaiian islands, all the doctors on that island who had once delivered babies have stopped doing so because their malpractice premiums were outstripping their fees; pregnant women must now travel elsewhere, to another island, for their needs. In 1984 Connaught Laboratories discontinued distribution of an important vaccine for children because it could not obtain liability insurance. It later succeeded in doing so, but only at a very high cost. As a result, in just 3 years the cost of this vaccine rose from 11 cents per dose to $4.50. Hundreds of American cities and towns find themselves unable to afford basic liability coverage. The city of Blue Lake, California, has been forced to shut its skating rink, tennis court, and parks. And at New York's famous Coney Island Amusement Park, they have had to close the roller coaster. Even everyday items contain hidden costs that arise from the expansion of tort liability.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmemberstheamericantortreformassociation", "title": "Remarks to Members of the American Tort Reform Association", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-members-the-american-tort-reform-association", "publication_date": "30-05-1986", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And because the Boy Scouts of America have been forced to increase their insurance coverage, it is feared that every Boy Scout and Cub Scout troop may have to be assessed some $20-not an insignificant sum in the underprivileged neighborhoods that perhaps need the Boy Scouts most. These problems have begun to eat away at the fabric of American life. There is still such a thing as common sense, and this ain't it! The time has come for action. Earlier this year I endorsed the report of my Domestic Policy Council's Tort Policy Working Group. This report contains a number of recommendations, recommendations that include fixed-dollar limitations for certain kinds of awards and the establishment of assurances that liability judgments go to those actually wronged or injured and not to the lining of their attorney's pockets. Now, one of the report's most important recommendations urged our administration to submit reform legislation to the Congress. This legislation, carefully drafted, has now been introduced in the Congress by Senator Robert Kasten and Congressman Hamilton Fish. It restores the fault standard, which requires that actual fault or wrongdoing must be established in most cases before liability can be assessed. It limits pain-and-suffering and punitive damage awards, awards the amount contingency-fee lawyers could earn, and restricts the joint and several liability doctrine that can force a single defendant to pay all damages even if he is only partly to blame. To be sure, much tort law would remain to be reformed by the 50 States, not the Federal Government. And in our Federal system of government this is only right. Many of the Tort Policy Working Group recommendations, for example, would have to be implemented at the State level to be fully effective. This administration's bill represents a much-needed overhaul of Federal laws governing interstate commerce one of the fields of authority the Federal Government is specifically granted by the Constitution and sets an example of common sense for the rest of the Nation to follow. Many here have been following this issue closely. Indeed, there are stalwarts in this hall who have been out front since the beginning, and I am grateful for your support. Now I ask you to join me in urging the Congress to pass this bill and to do so with dispatch.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmemberstheamericantortreformassociation", "title": "Remarks to Members of the American Tort Reform Association", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-members-the-american-tort-reform-association", "publication_date": "30-05-1986", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

We need, we are proud of, our fighting men most decidedly. But, during the anxious times ahead, let us not forget that they need us too. It goes almost without saying that we must continue to forge the weapons of victory- the hundreds of thousands of items, large and small, essential to the waging of the war. This has been the major task from the very start, and it is still a major task. This is the very worst time for any war worker to think of leaving his machine or to look for a peacetime job. And it goes almost without saying, too, that we must continue to provide our Government with the funds necessary for waging war not only by the payment of taxes- which, after all, is an obligation of American citizenship but also by the purchase of war bonds- an act of free choice which every citizen has to make for himself under the guidance of his own conscience. Whatever else any of us may be doing, the purchase of war bonds and stamps is something all of us can do and should do to help win the war. I am happy to report tonight that it is something which nearly everyone seems to be doing. Although there are now approximately sixty-seven million persons who have or earn some form of income, eighty-one million persons or their children have already bought war bonds. They have bought more than six hundred million individual bonds. Their purchases have totaled more than thirty-two billion dollars. These are the purchases of individual men, women, and children. Anyone who would have said this was possible a few years ago would have been put down as a starry-eyed visionary. But of such visions is the stuff of America fashioned. I am reminded of the fact that after the fall of France in 1940 I asked the Congress for the money for the production by the United States of fifty thousand airplanes per year. And yet today we are building airplanes at the rate of one hundred thousand a year.

While I know that the chief interest tonight is centered on the English Channel and on the beaches and farms and the cities of Normandy, we should not lose sight of the fact that our armed forces are engaged on other battlefronts all over the world, and that no one front can be considered alone without its proper relation to all. It is worth while, therefore, to make over-all comparisons with the past. At that time Germany was in control of practically all of Europe, and was steadily driving the Russians back toward the Ural Mountains. Germany was practically in control of North Africa and the Mediterranean, and was beating at the gates of the Suez Canal and the route to India. Japan was in control of the western Aleutian Islands; and in the South Pacific was knocking at the gates of Australia and New Zealand- and also was threatening India. Japan had seized control of most of the Central Pacific. American armed forces on land and sea and in the air were still very definitely on the defensive, and in the building-up stage. Our allies were bearing the heat and the brunt of the attack. In 1942 Washington heaved a sigh of relief that the first war bond issue had been cheerfully oversubscribed by the American people. Way back in those days, two years ago, America was still hearing from many amateur strategists and political critics, some of whom were doing more good for Hitler than for the United States- two years ago. But today we are on the offensive all over the world bringing the attack to our enemies. In the Pacific, by relentless submarine and naval attacks, and amphibious thrusts, and ever-mounting air attacks, we have deprived the Japs of the power to check the momentum of our ever-growing and ever-advancing military forces. We have reduced the Japs' shipping by more than three million tons. We have overcome their original advantage in the air. We have cut off from a return to the homeland tens of thousands of beleaguered Japanese troops who now face starvation or ultimate surrender. And we have cut down their naval strength, so that for many months they have avoided all risk of encounter with our naval forces.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsfiresidechat3", "title": "Fireside Chat.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/fireside-chat-3", "publication_date": "12-06-1944", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

Turning now to our enemy who is first on the list for destruction- Germany has her back against the wall- in fact three walls at once! In the south- we have broken the German hold on central Italy. On June 4, the city of Rome fell to the Allied armies. And allowing the enemy no respite, the Allies are now pressing hard on the heels of the Germans as they retreat northwards in evergrowing confusion. On the east our gallant Soviet allies have driven the enemy back from the lands which were invaded three years ago. The great Soviet armies are now initiating crushing blows. Overhead vast Allied air fleets of bombers and fighters have been waging a bitter air war over Germany and Western Europe. to destroy German war industries which maintain the German armies and air forces; and to shoot the German Luftwaffe out of the air. As a result, German production has been whittled down continuously, and the German fighter forces now have only a fraction of their former power. This great air campaign, strategic and tactical, is going to continue with increasing power. And on the west the hammer blow which struck the coast of France last Tuesday morning, less than a week ago, was the culmination of many months of careful planning and strenuous preparation. Millions of tons of weapons and supplies, and hundreds of thousands of men assembled in England, are now being poured into the great battle in Europe. I think that from the standpoint of our enemy we have achieved the impossible. We have broken through their supposedly impregnable wall in northern France. But the assault has been costly in men and costly in materials. Some of our landings were desperate adventures; but from advices received so far, the losses were lower than our commanders had estimated would occur. We have established a firm foothold. We are now prepared to meet the inevitable counterattacks of the Germans with power and with confidence. And we all pray that we will have far more, soon, than a firm foothold.

Her people call her Dona Violeta, a name of affection and respect. And as I have come to know her I have understood, for she personifies the blend of resolve and compassion that inspires a nation to become the best it can be. I will tell you something that impresses me. Not only is she working resolutely to bring about tangible reforms expanding democracy and economic opportunity, but she is also embarked on what she terms a quest to restore moral values. a triangle for equality, a rainbow for peace, and a shower of light for liberty shining throughout the land, liberty that is embodied by Violeta Chamorro and by her late husband and inspiration, Pedro Joaquin. He used to own a boat named Santa Libertad, glorious liberty. Well, the world now watches as his widow steers her own Santa Libertad, her ship of state, bound for a bright horizon that promises freedom, respect, and dignity for every person in her land.

I think it is particularly appropriate that we meet here in the East Room to chat for a few minutes about some of our Nation's problems. As I think most of you know, the East Room is very, very rich in history in our National Capital. This famous room is full of happy as well as sad moments in the lives of residents of this house and in this Nation's past. You might be interested to know that the first First Lady in this house was Abigail Adams, who wrote her family of hanging laundry in this room and the problems of the new Federal City. Adams sent news to her family of the large and small problems that she faced as First Lady--the same kind of news, I might add, that you in this room share with your readers back home. I have some very fond memories of non-metropolitan weekly and daily newspapers in the Fifth District of Michigan, which was, of course, the district that I had the honor and privilege of representing for over 25 years. During the various Congressional campaigns that I had--13 in all--I advertised very, very heavily, with good results----which I think is a tribute to the impact that all of you in your respective communities has on the people that you represent. I know firsthand that the weekly newspaper or the daily newspaper in a suburban area is the best means of communication, and I have been in many homes in rural areas as wall as in small towns where the paper that came on Thursday or Friday was still good reading material on the following Wednesday. In recent years, the growth in the number of suburban newspapers, I think, reflects the importance of this brand of personal journalism. In an age of mass communications, you are in the business--and fortunately--the business of local communications. It is my judgment, as I expressed a moment ago, that you fill a very important need for your readers--the need to know about the problems of the local community. Although we must recognize--and we do--that the world has grown small and interdependent in many, many ways, the fact remains that the news around the corner and down the street is still mighty important to people all over this great country.

Naturally, I admire your work, but I add very quickly that I need your help. A meaningful discussion of national problems cannot take place only on network television or in large metropolitan newspapers, because these forums do not provide sufficient opportunity for audience response and direct participation. One of the reasons, in my judgment, it is important for me and members of this Administration to travel around our country and to meet in Washington with groups like this one is to listen as well as to talk about the Nation's problems. Perhaps my Congressional background convinced me of the value of face-to-face contact, but there is no substitute for the discussions of ideas in person with community leaders such as yourselves. The best briefing paper in the world cannot explain problems as well as someone who deals with those problems on a very daily and direct basis. Government officials, I have learned, whether it was in the Congress or in this house, need more talkback from the people that they serve, and that is particularly true of those of us in Washington in the political atmosphere in which we live. This town can be just as parochial as a town of 250 people, and in some respects it is even more so. One of our ways at the White House of getting talkback is the briefing sessions that you have participated in, but another is for you to send your comments, your editorials to Ron Nessen of our Press Office. We need to hear from you, and we need to hear from the readers that all of you serve. We also need your help in describing the problems and the solutions that seem to be the best answer to the problems that we have. But the economic and energy debate underway now must not become simply an exchange of rhetoric, whether it is in the printed media, the electronic media, or just plain talk among people. The debate, as I see it, must produce action. In January, for example, this Administration outlined a comprehensive program to deal with some very harsh realities facing our Nation, both economically and in energy.

You deal with deadlines in your business, and I can recall vividly going to many smaller communities in my district on a Wednesday to talk with people in those communities, and I always stopped by the local weekly to chat with the editor. I soon learned that Wednesday was not the time to do it. If I wanted to lose points rather than make them, I did it on a Saturday or on a Monday. As I said, you deal with deadlines, and if those deadlines are not met, then you cannot serve your readers on time. It is my judgment that the Congress must respond to some very real national deadlines. I asked, for example, for action by April 1 on the rebate of 1974 income taxes for individuals as well as for business. There has been much discussion on who should receive the tax rebates--a discussion based too often on purely political considerations. I do not think we can look at this rebate on a political basis. We have to look on how a rebate will affect all Americans. It is sometimes fashionable to talk as if what is good for the American economy is not good for the American people. This tendency to treat the economy as an abstract idea divorced from the lives of the citizens leads to some unfortunate piecemeal proposals. When the economy is sound, it means the people of this Nation are able to live comfortably without fear of inflation and with jobs. To meet the proposed April 1 deadline on the tax cut, which is a program to stimulate the economy to provide jobs, the Senate must act before it recesses March 21, and the House of Representatives before its March 26 Easter recess. The tax cut is only a part of the program that this Administration--that I proposed in January, and there has been more response from Capitol Hill on this proposal than on many others. But as necessary as the tax cut is for the reasons that I have given, it is only a very small piece of the total action that must be taken and taken quickly. It is my judgment that the Congress must act on other parts of this total package, especially in the field of energy. In the State of the Union Address, I called for action in 90 days on a more comprehensive tax program.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksparticipantsthegovernmentaffairsconferencethenationalnewspaperassociation", "title": "Remarks to Participants in the Government Affairs Conference of the National Newspaper Association.", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-participants-the-government-affairs-conference-the-national-newspaper-association", "publication_date": "14-03-1975", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Gerald R.

Legge probably makes as great a sacrifice as any citizen ever made to enter public service. It will reduce the gentleman's salary from something over $100,000 a year to $12,000 a year, as an evidence of his desire to be of service to the American farmer. Teague likewise makes a very great sacrifice in income. I do not know precisely what his remuneration is as the head of the two largest farmer cooperative associations, but it is certainly far in excess of $12,000 a year. Legge will be the Chairman of the Board for the first year, and Mr. Stone will undoubtedly be the Vice Chairman. You will recollect that in the selection of an outstanding businessman for the Board we consulted with some 150 farm organizations and found that they were desirous that that should be done, and I further consulted the leaders or had the leaders of numbers of those associations consulted on the question of selecting Mr. Legge, and they were very desirous that he should be secured if possible. We ought to have some more acceptances in the course of a day or two, but that fills five members of the Board out of the eight.1 While talking of sacrifice I should include also the other three members of the Board, who also are making a tremendous sacrifice to come into this Board each one of them. All of the men whom I have invited to come on the Board have considered that here was an opportunity to do probably as great a service as will come to our generation, and that there was no call upon them to which they should not respond. With the exception of Mr. Legge, all of the men so far chosen have been at the direct proposal of farm organizations. I have a question of possible tax reduction. We are giving a great deal of study to the possibilities in that direction, and we all hope that a situation may work out on the safe side of a surplus for tax relief.

And we must know how far we can reduce expenditure in the Government in other directions to partly compensate for these increases that have been imposed by the legislation of the last 6 or 8 months. We do know that the expenditure during the past fiscal year just ended exceeded by $200 million the amount budgeted and passed by Congress as the budget. The completion of the budget for the year beginning the first of next July will give us a fairly clearer idea as to what the permanent burdens of the increased legislation may be and again as to what we can save in other directions. And then beyond that on the revenue side, we must have some experience as to whether or not the increase in revenue is due to temporary stock exchange activity or other temporary causes, and then we can come to a final conclusion. All of those things ought to develop during the next 4 or 5 months. By the first of November we ought to be able to see fairly clearly where our commitments and income are likely to land us.

I cannot tell you how much I appreciate the fact that we have with us what I like to refer to as the fairy Queen. We had the fairy Princess with us the time before, before she became the Queen of England. We appreciate the fact that our friendship with the Netherlands has been long and lasting. The largest bay on the North American Continent is named for a Dutchman, and his name was Hudson. One of the most beautiful rivers in the country--I say one of the most beautiful, not the most beautiful, necessarily--is named for this same Hendrik Hudson. The Dutch made a great contribution to the settlement of this great Nation of ours, and the Dutch also made a great contribution after we became a great nation, because they were willing to invest their money in this country of ours--and did--for its development. They put on a point 4 program long before I was old enough to know what it meant. They built railroads, ranches, buildings--one of the greatest apartments in this area of Washington was built by Dutch capital. We are grateful for that. We want to show our gratefulness, and we have been trying to show that by the fact that we were--and are--willing to help free Europe recover and meet the world menace east of Poland. We have succeeded, to some extent in getting that done. We have stopped them at every perimeter in which they have made the attempt to make slaves out of their neighbors. We have a different situation here on this western continent. The United States is credited with being at this time one of the strongest nations in the history of the world. It has neighbors on the south. It has neighbors on the north. Those neighbors are not afraid of us. They do not think we are going to try to take them over, or make them colonies, or make them a part of our own territory. We hope to see the whole world set up on that basis someday--and I think we will. And one of the great assets in our efforts to get that done is the great country that these lovely people represent. I hope they will enjoy themselves. I hope they will take back a good opinion of this Nation of ours, and that when they go home they will feel more friendly to us than when they came--if that is possible.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstoaststhepresidentandqueenjuliana", "title": "Toasts of the President and Queen Juliana", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/toasts-the-president-and-queen-juliana", "publication_date": "02-04-1952", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Harry S.

You are in the company of the best of our country. I want to congratulate the teachers who are here from around the country. It is a great experience for Laura and me to greet you in the Oval Office.

I want to thank the Council of Chief State School Officers and Scholastic, Inc., for organizing this program.

You do the vital work of teaching our children. You give them the skills that will help them succeed. You lay the foundation for realizing the American Dream. You do more than that, though. You kindle imaginations. You foster a love for learning that can last a lifetime. The best teachers treat every child with dignity and fairness and insist that their students treat others the same way. And through your encouragement and caring, you teach the students to respect themselves. To a child, it is a special feeling when a teacher knows your name and asks your opinion, cares what you think and gives you encouragement. For some students, unfortunately, you might be the only person who does that. Anyone who has visited the classroom can see that teaching demands poise and warmth and, oftentimes, extraordinary patience, as my fourth grade teacher had to show. Yet, only the family members of teachers know some of the other traits that define great teachers. They have seen you stay up late rewriting lesson plans. They have seen you seek new ways to advance your skills. They have seen you somehow summon the energy to make an after-school game or a play. For you, teaching is not just a profession; it is a calling you have answered. And we thank you for that. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We ask a lot from our teachers, and you are right to expect a lot from society.

I used to say when I was Governor of Texas, education is to a State what defense is to the National Government. If people are worried about the quality of the education in the State in which they live, get your Governors to make education the number one priority of the State. And finally, the Federal Government has got a role to play as well. We have increased spending here by 43 percent. The next budget will make it 50 percent over the past 4 years. Under the No Child Left Behind Act, we are making sure that Federal money actually goes to help students learn. I love the spirit of the No Child Left Behind Act, by the way. It is what I call challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations. You see, the reason you are Teachers of the Year is because you set high expectations. You know in your heart of hearts every child can learn. You are willing to raise that bar, to set high standards. I appreciate so very much the willingness for teachers also to use the accountability systems to determine whether or not what you are doing is working. But make no mistake about it, we understand here in Washington that the people who really make student achievement possible are the good-hearted teachers who work hard every single day to make sure that no child is left behind. And that is why we honor you here in the Rose Garden. Our 2004 National Teacher of the Year is Kathy Mellor. She embodies the qualities that all students and parents hope for in a teacher. For nearly 20 years, Ms. Mellor has taught English as a second language in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. Kathy redesigned her district's ESL program to better integrate students with their English-speaking classmates, and the educational benefits of her innovation have been clear. As the parent of one of Mrs. Mellor's students wrote, My daughter's English improved unbelievably that year. At the end of the year, she was able to finish her regular class assignments. The mom said, she is able to do so alone or with a little help from her. Mellor's creative approach extends well beyond the classroom. She applied for and received a grant to teach English to the mothers of her ESL students.

I had the opportunity to speak with President Karzai this morning, and I wanted to congratulate him on accepting the certification of the recent election. As we all know, this has been a very difficult time in Afghanistan, to not only carry out a election under difficult circumstances, where there were a whole host of security issues that had to be resolved, but also postelection, a lot of uncertainty. President Karzai, as well as the other candidates, I think have shown that they have the interest of the Afghan people at heart, that this is a reflection of a commitment to rule of law, and a insistence that the Afghan people's will should be done. And so I expressed the American people's appreciation for this step. You have violent forces opposed to democracy in Afghanistan. And yet despite these very difficult conditions, what we have seen is elections take place. We have now seen the IEC and the ECC in Afghanistan complete their work. We have seen the candidates expressing a willingness to abide by constitutional law, and there is a path forward in order to complete this election process. I want to give particular thanks to Ambassador Karl Eikenberry and his team, who have been working tirelessly throughout this process. I also want to commend Senator John Kerry, who was in the region traveling and ended up working extensively with Ambassador Eikenberry and was extraordinarily constructive and very helpful. So I think he deserves great congratulations. Moving forward, we will continue to work with our ISAF partners as well as the Afghan Government, however this election turns out, to ensure that we can move the Afghan that we can move Afghanistan towards peace and security and prosperity and that the will of the Afghan people is ultimately done. So we are pleased with the steps that have been taken today, and we hope that we can build on this progress. I finally want to thank the incredible work of our U.S. military and the young men and women who are stationed in Afghanistan who are doing so much to help bring about a more secure and prosperous and democratic Afghanistan. I am grateful to have the opportunity to see Prime Minister Maliki once again. We had a wide-ranging discussion about the continuing progress that Iraq is making.

That is consistent with the transition that has been taking place, and I reemphasized my commitment to Prime Minister Maliki that we will have our combat troops out of Iraq by August of next year and all of our troops out of Iraq by 2011. But we did not just talk about military and security issues. What is wonderful about this trip is that it represents a transition in our bilateral relationship, so that we are moving now to issues beyond security and we are beginning to talk about economy, trade, commerce. The business and investment conference that is taking place is going to be very well attended. It includes not only Prime Minister Maliki but business leaders from both the United States and Iraq. We have seen over the last several months progress being made on providing clarification about investment laws inside of Iraq. There are, obviously, enormous opportunities for our countries to do business together. And so I just want to congratulate Prime Minister Maliki on what I am confident will be a successful conference and to reemphasize my administration's full support for all the steps that can be taken so that Iraq can not only be a secure place and a democratic country but also a place where people can do business, people can find work, families can make a living, and children are well educated. And that broader sense of a U.S. relationship with a democratic Iraq is one that I think all of us are confident we can now achieve. And I do not know if you maybe we could translate the last part just about Iraq, as opposed to Afghanistan, just in case there is some Prime Minister Maliki. Thank you, ENTITY, and this opportunity to hold the business investment conference is a big economic demonstration and manifestation of the importance of this event that brings together more than 1,000 business entrepreneurs and a very distinguished, high-level Iraqi delegation.

It is an honor for me today to be joined by my predecessor, President Bush, who took the major steps in negotiating this North American Free Trade Agreement; President Jimmy Carter, whose vision of hemispheric development gives great energy to our efforts and has been a consistent theme of his for many, many years now; and President Ford, who has argued as fiercely for expanded trade and for this agreement as any American citizen and whose counsel I continue to value. These men, differing in party and outlook, join us today because we all recognize the important stakes for our Nation in this issue. Yesterday we saw the sight of an old world dying, a new one being born in hope and a spirit of peace. Peoples who for a decade were caught in the cycle of war and frustration chose hope over fear and took a great risk to make the future better. Today we turn to face the challenge of our own hemisphere, our own country, our own economic fortunes. In a few moments, I will sign three agreements that will complete our negotiations with Mexico and Canada to create a North American Free Trade Agreement. In the coming months I will submit this pact to Congress for approval. It will be a hard fight, and I expect to be there with all of you every step of the way. And I'd like to tell you why. First of all, because NAFTA means jobs, American jobs and good-paying American jobs. If I did not believe that, I would not support this agreement. As President, it is my duty to speak frankly to the American people about the world in which we now live. Fifty years ago at the end of World War II, an unchallenged America was protected by the oceans and by our technological superiority and, very frankly, by the economic devastation of the people who could otherwise have been our competitors. We chose then to try to help rebuild our former enemies and to create a world of free trade supported by institutions which would facilitate it. As a result of that effort, global trade grew from $200 billion in 1950 to $800 billion in 1980. As a result, jobs were created and opportunity thrived all across the world.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthesigningceremonyforthesupplementalagreementsthenorthamericanfreetrade", "title": "Remarks at the Signing Ceremony for the Supplemental Agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-signing-ceremony-for-the-supplemental-agreements-the-north-american-free-trade", "publication_date": "14-09-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 5849, "text": "But make no mistake about it, our decision at the end of World War II to create a system of global, expanded, freer trade, and the supporting institutions, played a major role in creating the prosperity of the American middle class. Ours is now an era in which commerce is global and in which money, management, technology are highly mobile. For the last 20 years, in all the wealthy countries of the world, because of changes in the global environment, because of the growth of technology, because of increasing competition, the middle class that was created and enlarged by the wise policies of expanding trade at the end of World War II has been under severe stress. Most Americans are working harder for less. They are vulnerable to the fear tactics and the averseness to change that is behind much of the opposition to NAFTA. But I want to say to my fellow Americans, when you live in a time of change the only way to recover your security and to broaden your horizons is to adapt to the change, to embrace it, to move forward. Nothing we do, nothing we do in this great capital can change the fact that factories or information can flash across the world, that people can move money around in the blink of an eye. Nothing can change the fact that technology can be adopted, once created, by people all across the world and then rapidly adapted in new and different ways by people who have a little different take on the way the technology works. For two decades, the winds of global competition have made these things clear to any American with eyes to see. The only way we can recover the fortunes of the middle class in this country so that people who work harder and smarter can at least prosper more, the only way we can pass on the American dream of the last 40 years to our children and their children for the next 40 is to adapt to the changes which are occurring. In a fundamental sense, this debate about NAFTA is a debate about whether we will embrace these changes and create the jobs of tomorrow, or try to resist these changes, hoping we can preserve the economic structures of yesterday. I tell you, my fellow Americans, that if we learned anything from the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the fall of the governments in Eastern Europe, even a totally controlled society cannot resist the winds of change that economics and technology and information flow have imposed in this world of ours. Our only realistic option is to embrace these changes and create the jobs of tomorrow.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthesigningceremonyforthesupplementalagreementsthenorthamericanfreetrade", "title": "Remarks at the Signing Ceremony for the Supplemental Agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-signing-ceremony-for-the-supplemental-agreements-the-north-american-free-trade", "publication_date": "14-09-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 5850, "text": "I believe that NAFTA will create 200,000 American jobs in the first 2 years of its effect. I believe if you look at the trends-and President Bush and I were talking about it this morning-starting about the time he was elected President, over one-third of our economic growth and in some years over one-half of our net new jobs came directly from exports. And on average, those exports-related jobs paid much higher than jobs that had no connection to exports. I believe that NAFTA will create a million jobs in the first 5 years of its impact. And I believe that that is many more jobs than will be lost, as inevitably some will be, as always happens when you open up the mix to a new range of competition. NAFTA will generate these jobs by fostering an export boom to Mexico, by tearing down tariff walls which have been lowered quite a bit by the present administration of President Salinas but are still higher than Americas'. Already Mexican consumers buy more per capita from the United States than other consumers in other nations. Most Americans do not know this, but the average Mexican citizen, even though wages are much lower in Mexico, the average Mexican citizen is now spending $450 per year per person to buy American goods. So when people say that this trade agreement is just about how to move jobs to Mexico so nobody can make a living, how do they explain the fact that Mexicans keep buying more products made in America every year? Mexican citizens with lower incomes spend more money-real dollars, not percentage of their income-more money on American products than Germans, Japanese, Canadians. And there will be more if they have more money to spend. That is what expanding trade is all about. In 1987, Mexico exported $5.7 billion more of products to the United States than they purchased from us. We had a trade deficit. Because of the free market, tariff-lowering policies of the Salinas government in Mexico, and because our people are becoming more export-oriented, that $5.7 billion trade deficit has been turned into a $5.4 billion trade surplus for the United States. It has created hundreds of thousands of jobs. Even when you subtract the jobs that have moved into the maquilladora areas, America is a net job winner in what has happened in trade in the last 6 years.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthesigningceremonyforthesupplementalagreementsthenorthamericanfreetrade", "title": "Remarks at the Signing Ceremony for the Supplemental Agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-signing-ceremony-for-the-supplemental-agreements-the-north-american-free-trade", "publication_date": "14-09-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 5851, "text": "When Mexico boosts its consumption of petroleum products in Louisiana-where we are going tomorrow to talk about NAFTA-as it did by about 200 percent in that period, Louisiana refinery workers gained job security. When Mexico purchased industrial machinery and computer equipment made in Illinois, that means more jobs. In this same period, Mexico increased those purchases out of Illinois by 300 percent. Forty-eight out of the 50 States have boosted exports to Mexico since 1987. That is one reason why 41 of our Nation's 50 Governors-some of them who are here today, and I thank them for their presence-support this trade pact. I can tell you, if you are a Governor, people will not leave you in office unless they think you get up every day trying to create more jobs. And the people who have the job of creating jobs for their State and working with their business community, working with their labor community, 41 out of the 50 have already embraced the NAFTA pact. Many Americans are still worried that this agreement will move jobs south of the border because they have seen jobs move south of the border and because they know that there are still great differences in the wage rates. There have been 19 serious economic studies of NAFTA by liberals and conservatives alike; 18 of them have concluded that there will be no job loss. Businesses do not choose to locate based solely on wages. If they did, Haiti and Bangladesh would have the largest number of manufacturing jobs in the world. Businesses do choose to locate based on the skills and productivity of the work force, the attitude of the government, the roads and railroads to deliver products, the availability of a market close enough to make the transportation costs meaningful, the communications networks necessary to support the enterprise. As it becomes Mexico's strength and they generate more jobs, they will have higher incomes, and they will buy more American products. We can win this. This is not a time for defeatism. It is a time to look at an opportunity that is enormous. Moreover, there are specific provisions in this agreement that remove some of the current incentives for people to move their jobs just across our border. For example, today Mexican law requires United States automakers who want to sell cars to Mexicans to build them in Mexico.

{"id": 5852, "text": "Under NAFTA, the Big Three automakers expect to ship 60,000 cars to Mexico in the first year alone, and that is one reason why one of the automakers recently announced moving 1,000 jobs from Mexico back to Michigan. In a few moments, I will sign side agreements to NAFTA that will make it harder than it is today for businesses to relocate solely because of very low wages or lax environmental rules. These side agreements will make a difference. The environmental agreement will, for the first time ever, apply trade sanctions against any of the countries that fails to enforce its own environmental laws. For people who have been asking us to ask that of Mexico, how do we have the right to ask that of Mexico if we do not demand it of ourselves? This is the first time that there have ever been trade sanctions in the environmental law area. This ground-breaking agreement is one of the reasons why major environmental groups, ranging from the Audubon Society to the Natural Resources Defense Council, are supporting NAFTA. The second agreement ensures that Mexico enforces its laws in areas that include worker health and safety, child labor, and the minimum wage. And I might say, this is the first time in the history of world trade agreements when any nation has ever been willing to tie its minimum wage to the growth in its own economy. What does that mean? It means that there will be an even more rapid closing of the gap between our two wage rates. And as the benefits of economic growth are spread in Mexico to working people, what will happen? They will have more disposable income to buy more American products, and there will be less illegal immigration because more Mexicans will be able to support their children by staying home. The third agreement answers one of the primary attacks on NAFTA that I heard for a year, which is, Well, you can say all this, but something might happen that you cannot foresee. Well, that is a good thing, otherwise we never would have had yesterday. I mean, I plead guilty to that. Something might happen that Carla Hills did not foresee, or George Bush did not foresee, or Mickey Kantor or Bill Clinton did not foresee. Now, the third agreement protects our industries against unforeseen surges in exports from either one of our trading partners.

{"id": 5853, "text": "NAFTA will help to do that. This imposes also a new obligation on our Government, and I am glad to see so many Members of Congress from both parties here today. We do have some obligations here. We have to make sure that our workers are the best prepared, the best trained in the world. Without regard to NAFTA, we know now that the average 18-year-old American will change jobs eight times in a lifetime. The Secretary of Labor has told us, without regard to NAFTA, that over the last 10 years, for the first time, when people lose their jobs most of them do not go back to their old job; they go back to a different job. So that we no longer need an unemployment system, we need a reemployment system. And we have to create that. We have to tell American workers who will be dislocated because of this agreement, or because of things that will happen regardless of this agreement, that we are going to have a reemployment program for training in America. And we intend to do that. Together, the efforts of two administrations now have created a trade agreement that moves beyond the traditional notions of free trade, seeking to ensure trade that pulls everybody up instead of dragging some down while others go up. We have put the environment at the center of this in future agreements. We have sought to avoid a debilitating contest for business where countries seek to lure them only by slashing wages or despoiling the environment. This agreement will create jobs, thanks to trade with our neighbors. That is reason enough to support it. But I must close with a couple of other points. NAFTA is essential to our longterm ability to compete with Asia and Europe. Across the globe our competitors are consolidating, creating huge trading blocs. This pact will create a free trade zone stretching from the Arctic to the tropics, the largest in the world, a $6.5 billion market with 370 million people.

And she talked to Presidents from Colombia, from Chile, from Venezuela, from Uruguay, from Argentina, from Brazil. They all wanted to know, Tell me, is NAFTA going to pass so we can become part of this great new market-more, hundreds of millions more of American consumers for our products. It is no secret that there is division within both the Democratic and Republican Parties on this issue. That often happens in a time of great change. I just want to say something about this because it is very important. I am going to sit down when you talk, so I am glad you got to do it. I am very grateful to the Presidents for coming here, because there is division in the Democratic Party and there is division in the Republican Party. That is because this fight is not a traditional fight between Democrats and Republicans and liberals and conservatives. It is right at the center of the effort that we are making in America to define what the future is going to be about. But if you strip away the differences, it is clear that most of the people that oppose this pact are rooted in the fears and insecurities that are legitimately gripping the great American middle class. It is no use denying that many of our people have lost in the battle for change. Every single solitary thing you hear people talk about, that they are worried about, can happen whether this trade agreement passes or not, and most of them will be made worse if it fails. And I can tell you it will be better if it passes. Are we going to compete and win, or are we going to withdraw? Are we going to face the future with confidence that we can create tomorrow's jobs, or are we going to try against all the evidence of the last 20 years to hold on to yesterday's? Are we going to take the plain evidence of the good faith of Mexico in opening their own markets and buying more of our products and creating more of our jobs, or are we going to give in to the fears of the worst-case scenario? Are we going to pretend that we do not have the first trade agreement in history dealing seriously with labor standards, environmental standards, and cleverly and clearly taking account of unforeseen consequences, or are we going to say this is the best you can do and then some?", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthesigningceremonyforthesupplementalagreementsthenorthamericanfreetrade", "title": "Remarks at the Signing Ceremony for the Supplemental Agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-signing-ceremony-for-the-supplemental-agreements-the-north-american-free-trade", "publication_date": "14-09-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

This is the state where the story of American independence began. And three days from now, this is the state that will save the American dream. On November 3rd, we are going to win Pennsylvania, and we are going to win four more years in that very beautiful White House. We gather today in a very special place. In the harrowing days of December 1776, when the American revolution seemed lost, General George Washington made his headquarters as this Bucks County farmhouse to plan his famous crossing of the Delaware. On Christmas night, he led what remained, and just very little remained, of that rag tag continental army on a daring midnight raid. They marched through nine miles of ice and snow, many without boots on their feet, leaving a trail of blood in their wake. At dawn, they seized victory at Trenton. Their sacrifice turned the entire tide of the war. Those soldiers came from every walk of life, but what united them all was their devotion to the principle of self-government. They were determined to live in a country where power belongs to the people. That priceless inheritance is at stake just three days from now, and a great red wave is forming. As sure as you are there, as sure as we are here together, and they see it. They see it at all sides, and there is not a thing they can do about it. This is the fundamental question facing every voter in American. Do you want to be a nation ruled by the corrupt political class, or do you want to be governed by the American people? I ran for office four years ago because I could not sit by and watch any longer as a small group of Washington insiders continued to get rich bleeding America dry. They are just bleeding America dry. Closing our factories, opening our borders, outsourcing our industries, and letting foreign countries ravage our middle class. Career politicians spend trillions of dollars fighting foreign wars, while letting our own cities crumble and decay. Here in Pennsylvania, you know this bitter and very painful betrayal all too well. The corrupt Washington class launched an economic war against this state. For decades, they targeted your steel mills, shut down your plants, and sent millions of your jobs overseas, all while lining their pockets with special interest cash, and no one embodies this betrayal and treachery more than Joe Biden.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptsdonaldtrumprallyspeechtranscriptnewtownpaoctober31", "title": "Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31", "source": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31", "publication_date": "31-10-2020", "crawling_date": "29-06-2023", "politician": ["Donald Trump"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Then Biden pushed the job killing Paris Climate Accord, an economic nightmare for Pennsylvania miners and every worker in our country. He backed TPP, which would have extinguished the American auto industry forever. These betrayals not only made Biden's donors rich, they made his family rich, and as we know, he profited from the misery of unleashed work and horror given to Pennsylvania workers. He made a lot of money, his family made a lot of money, and nobody knew about it until just recently.

If you looked the debate, Kamala was failing fast, she was going down like a rock. Normally you pick somebody that is going up. She did not even make it to Iowa, right? Nobody spoke worse about him, and that is the one that they pick, but they want to get the radical left. They'd love to get her in. I do not know if you can never come back from a thing like that.

As president, my only special interest is you. To protect our national security, I also suspended the entry of refugees from foreign nations compromised by terrorism, just call up President Macron as I do often, and ask him what is happening over there? You saw those horrible attacks this last week, more than one. We are keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country, if I have your approval. Biden has pledged a staggering 700% increase in refugees. This is a deal made between Biden and Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie, the manifesto we call it. There is a document, a very thick document, naming things that they are all horrible, but they have agreed. These are some of the most dangerous places in the world. He is also vowed to terminate our national security travel bans, allowing for unlimited migration from war zones and terrorist havens. Biden's extreme migration policies will open the flood gates to terrorists, jihadists and violent extremists. You do not have to worry about it, just get out and vote on November 3rd. Under my administration, I had the ban passed, right? And it was approved by the United States Supreme Court. There, they did the right thing. Under my administration, the safest of our families will always come first. That safety, we want safety, has to come first. The Secretary of Defense under President Obama, Robert Gates, said that Joe Biden has been on the wrong side of every foreign policy issue in his lifetime. President Obama used to say that if you wanted something really screwed up, give it to Joe Biden to handle. This is the guy that we have running. In fact, Obama tried to keep Joe from running. He was very famously quoted as saying, Joe, you do not have to do this. You do not have to do this, Joe, do not do it. You do not have to do this. I could see that.

For months, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been inciting violence against police officers and riots, like those carried out by Biden supporters in Philadelphia. Look at what is going on in Philadelphia. They should call us into Philadelphia. We will solve the problem, or let their police handle the problem. Let their police handle the problem. If elected, the Democrat ticket will pass legislation to end cash bail, create sanctuary cities nationwide, and defund police departments all across America. In a second term, we will increase funding for law enforcement. We will hire more tough one crime prosecutors to put violent offenders behind bars. For 47 years, Joe Biden betrayed African Americans at every turn. He took your votes. He took you for granted, and then he shipped away your jobs and flooded your cities with cheap foreign labor. He devastated black families with his 1994 crime bill that really locked up tens of thousands of African-American men with unfair sentencing. And he called African American young men, super predators all the time. He would say super predators, a name that has always been something, there has been no name that they have hated more. They hated it with Hillary Clinton and they hate it with Joe Biden. He forged close relationships with pro segregation lawmakers and his trade deals decimated the black middle class. Joe Biden cares more about refugees living thousands of miles away that he does about Black Americans living in Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Detroit, Baltimore, Oakland. He is done nothing. And then he says to me, Oh, we should do this. I reversed the injustice of Biden's crime bill by signing landmark criminal justice reform, prison reform. And under our recently announced platinum plan, we will create three million new jobs for Black Americans, increase access to capital, restore safety to every neighborhood. And we will deliver school choice to every parent in America. And I am also fighting every day for Hispanic Americans.

You said what he did. You said that horrible deal that was made with the United States by Obama and Biden. I do not think Biden probably was too involved, if you want to know the truth, keep him out, but it was a terrible deal. It was like the Iran deal. Here is 150 billion for nothing. This year I have laid out the boldest and most ambitious second term agenda in history. We will create 10 million new jobs in the first 10 months, 2021, we will have 10 million jobs over the next four years. We will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We will expand opportunity zones. We will bring home our medical supply chains they are all coming home. And we will end reliance on China once and for all. We will defend religious liberty, the right to life, and the right to keep and bear arms. And we will restore patriotic education to our schools. In our debate last week, Joe Biden said that America has, Never, ever lived up to our founding ideals, right? Pennsylvanians know the truth more than most. When you think of the great history of this state, from Washington's crossing and Independence Hall in Philadelphia, to the Quakers who ran the underground railroad. From the union soldiers who lay at the rest and you lay at rest, they lay at rest in Gettysburg. What a place, Gettysburg, one of the most beautiful places and so gruesome for a period of time, never fight uphill my boys, right? To the workers of Bethlehem and Allentown who forged the steel that won World War II.

This week we have seen a good example of what happens when people talk to each other instead of shout at each other. And unfortunately, we have also seen what happens when some people go to unreasonable lengths to prevent reasonable discussion and decisionmaking. I am speaking to you from the Pacific Northwest where we have just concluded the Forest Conference. how best to preserve jobs and protect the forests in this beautiful and productive region of our great Nation. Yesterday in Portland, Oregon, timber workers, business people, environmentalists, and community leaders sat down together in a conference room, not a courtroom. We discussed how to achieve a healthy economy and a healthy environment. And I directed my Cabinet to come back within 60 days with a plan for a balanced policy. Grass roots Americans want to end the gridlock and get the economy moving. They want to follow the same practice that we followed in Oregon yesterday. Unfortunately, some people in Washington, DC, have not gotten the message that the people want fundamental change. Yesterday the minority party in the Senate used procedural tactics to prevent the entire Senate from voting on our jobs and economic recovery package, which has already been passed overwhelmingly by the House of Representatives. After 3 years, when America lost one million jobs in the private sector, the unemployment rate remained unchanged in March, and the total number of jobs in our economy actually declined. Now, some folks in Washington may think everything is fine, but all across America the people understand there will not be a real recovery until our working men and women can look forward to a secure, high-wage future for themselves and their children. The people know that America needs our plan to put 500,000 Americans back to work by beginning the investments we need in a stronger, smarter economy. It is time to move beyond the old politics of partisanship, posturing, and procedural delays and start working together to solve problems. And just as this works in our own country, so too can it work between ourselves and other nations. That is why I am taking my first trip out of the country today to meet with Russia's democratically elected President, Boris Yeltsin. Nowhere is progress toward democracy and free markets more important to us than in Russia and the new independent states of the former Soviet Union. Their progress presents a great security challenge and offers great economic opportunities.

Now we can reduce that spending because the arms and armies of the former Soviet Union pose a greatly reduced threat to us and to our allies. If Russia were to revert to its old ways or plunge into chaos, we would need to reassess our plans for defense savings. That could mean less money for creating new businesses and new jobs, less for preparing our children for the future, less for education. Our economic program at home, more jobs and greater incomes for Americans, could be jeopardized if the reforms in Russia fail. My discussions with President Yeltsin involve measures intended to help the Russian people make the difficult transition to a market economy by helping themselves. Just as we mobilized the world on behalf of war in the Gulf, we must now mobilize the world on behalf of peace and reform in Russia. Most of this effort will have to come from the Russian people themselves. They will chart the path to their own future. These efforts to offer an historic chance to improve our own security, however, require some action by ourselves, too. Russia still holds over 20,000 strategic and tactical nuclear warheads. We are implementing historic arms control agreements that for the first time will actually reduce the level of strategic nuclear weapons. By supporting Russia's reforms we can help turn the promise of those agreements into reality for ourselves and for our children and for the Russian people and their children as well. And we can make life in America more safe and prosperous. For too long, work in Washington on issues like economics, the environment, and foreign policy took place in isolation. The interests of the American people were not amply protected because their voices were not adequately heard. to bring men and women of good will together so that we can put people, the American people, first. Now, I ask you to call or write your Senators. I ask for your best wishes as I go into this meeting with President Yeltsin and your understanding that here there is no clear line between our interests at home and our interests abroad.

He is the first President of that great nation to be an official guest of the United States, although President Moi has been here in the past before he assumed his present position of national leadership. He and I have gotten to be good friends through our frequent communications with one another as we met the increasing challenges and dangers of people who are determined to live in freedom. We share moral values, we share religious faith, and we share political values as well, not only on a personal basis but among the people of our two countries. We have been particularly grateful to see the leadership shown by President Moi and the people of Kenya, along with the nonaligned countries throughout the world, in condemning the brutal invasion by the Soviet Union of Afghanistan, and the staunch demand by others, led by President Moi, that these invasion forces be withdrawn from Afghanistan. President Moi and the people of his country led the entire continent of Africa, on their own initiative, in announcing that the athletes of Kenya will not attend the Olympics in Moscow this summer because their invasion forces occupy a freedom-loving country. This is particularly significant, not only because of the leadership shown by President Moi but because of the superb competence of the athletes of Kenya, world renowned for their prowess in past Olympic games. We are also particularly grateful as a nation to the people of his country and to President Moi for their unswerving support for us in the trying times since the innocent American diplomats were captured by militants in Iran and held hostage. President Moi has used his influence on a political basis to intercede for those hostages held captive and has also led other deeply religious nations, on his own initiative, in calling for a day of prayer and personally led a prayer meeting in his country for the safety and wellbeing and the freedom of the American hostages. This is particularly important to us, and I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart, as the leader of our Nation, for this initiative on his part. We value, as do the people of Kenya, the worth of one individual human being, and we also value, as do the people of Kenya, the freedom of each individual human being. We share a political process.

{"id": 5891, "text": "So we will update you on the latest numbers in the State of California. We will walk through some new announcements and then of course here to catch up, answer any questions that you may have. The current number of people have tested positive in the State of California is 335, that is a 14% increase from the prior day. Tragically, we now have six individuals that have passed away from ENTITY, the novel Coronavirus. The State of California has conducted some 8,316 tests, that includes our 19 labs of which 2,665 of those tests were done by our labs, but those labs, as I noted a few days ago, had been supplemented by hospitals from Stanford to a number of UC as well as our private lab Quest in San Juan Capistrano. I will remind you that Quest currently is operating just one lab in the State of California and conducting roughly 1,200 tests on a daily basis. That will substantially ramp up in the next week or so with the two additional labs that will come online. We will get those tests just from that commercial lab up to 5,000 as much as 5,500 a day. But the total number North of 8,000, and we are increasing our capacity on an hourly basis, not just a daily basis. Accordingly, we have advanced a partnership that was initiated well over a week ago with Verily, the health and life science subsidiary of Alphabet. We advanced that partnership with the idea of bringing to market the capacity for individuals that have developed mild symptoms or are concerned about their status from the perspective of being a vulnerable population, being our seniors or higher risk of contracting the disease to give them the opportunity to go on this portal, to answer specific questions, to be scored in terms of their likelihood to be needed to be tested, and then be allowed and directed the opportunity to be tested at what will be at launch to specific sites, one in Santa Clara County, one in San Mateo County. That portal, that page that allows people to interface will go align tomorrow and we will then begin to make reservations, and people throughout the course of next week will be in the opportunity to get the mobile testing that so many are discussing and so many have promoted. We expect that those two pilots, one in Santa Clara County, one in San Mateo County will significantly expand other parts of the state.

There is simply no other interface that exists in the United States that allows people a portal that has questions and the capacity to geospatially identify where people are so we can identify the closest areas for mobile testing that we are aware of in the country. And so we are very encouraged by this partnership, very enthusiastic to finally announce it. I know there is been some conversations about it in the media, but it is going live this week in the next 48 hours, fully operational in the first two piloted areas in our state. We have the capacity currently through the assets in hand, be it swabs, issue that I will discuss in a moment, the issue of swabs. Not just the issue of reagents, not just the issue of RNA extraction kits that are part of our testing regime, but also the availability of swabs. But the first troche we have over 9,000 test capacity with the swabs and we will partner with Quest in terms of the diagnostics of those tests. The turnaround is typical at Quest, anywhere from two days, some cases three days, is roughly the estimate. People will be automatically notified based upon that screening criteria and based upon that interface on that portal of their test results. If people have severe symptoms, this is not where we want you to be tested. If you have severe symptoms, you need to engage the medical community directly. So we want to remind people, this is not to substitute that interface, but to supplement our capacity to get people that have some mild concerns and or people that are higher risks to remove them from overburdening our healthcare delivery system, to get them out of that setting and to allow people with the kind of portability that mobile testing provides to get answers quickly. But again, it is just a test, and so I just want to remind people of that framework and not promote it for something that it is not .

But significant increases nonetheless in the testing protocols are being advanced, again, I think quite substantively with this new partnership. As it relates to the purpose of developing these partnerships, the purpose of our testing that is to identify through community surveillance where we are so that we could begin to process how we need to manage the status quo and how we need to anticipate the growth and spread of the virus and look at allocating resources across the state accordingly I mentioned this a few days ago. I will remind folks, we have about 74,000 hospital beds in the state at 416 different hospitals. We have surge capacity in our state just shy of 9,000 beds, that is 8,661 beds to be exact, and that is on the basis of current survey that is very contemporary of the existing hospital system. We have about 11,500 ICU beds in our system, but that is not just for adults. That also includes pediatric ICUs. It is just shy of 11,500 when you add the two numbers up. We have new and detailed information about access to ventilators over 7,587. 7,587 ventilators currently reside in our hospitals and we have procured new ventilators, a few hundred that we were able to purchase, and we also have our own cash both through our MSA and our CDPH sites that include an additional roughly 900 ventilators, in addition to the 7,587 that I referenced. So I give you those numbers because a lot of people have asked about that information. I also make that point as a point of consideration and segue to the subsequent announcement, and that is as we manage this disease and the dynamic nature of this moment, we need to anticipate spread but we also need to prioritize our focus. The purpose of today's announcement is to focus on specifically what we mean by that. Most important thing again is to protect the most vulnerable, protect our seniors. In the State of California, we estimate we 5.3 million Californians that are 65 years or older.

We are calling for the home isolation of all seniors in the State of California. We are calling for the home isolation of all of those 65 years and older and those with chronic conditions. We are doing so with our eyes wide open at the magnitude of what that means and the need to provide wraparound services to support our seniors in need of medical supplies and need of meals and the like. The team assembled behind me and the people in this, what we refer to as soccer state operation center, of where we reside at the moment currently have 13 task forces that are working on a panoply of issues from logistics, from things as basic as not just food but water, fuel and basic supplies to more complex issues related to workforce and the like. So we are looking at this from a very holistic perspective and holistic lens. We recognize that social isolation for millions of Californians is anxiety inducing, but we recognize what all of the science bears out and what we recognize around the rest of the world that we need to meet this moment head on and lean in, not isolate ourselves to this moment, but lean in and own this moment and take actions that we think are commensurate with the need to protect the most vulnerable Californians. Number two, we are directing at all bars, nightclubs, wineries, brewpubs and the like be closed in the State of California. We believe that this is a non essential function in our state, and we believe that is appropriate under the circumstances to move in that direction. As it relates to restaurants, we have more nuanced concerns and considerations. Some have suggested just shutting down all of our restaurants. We do not believe ultimately that is necessary at this moment. Consideration nonetheless is to socially distance patrons within these establishment, and as a consequence, we are directing that we reduce the current occupancy within these establishments by half, and we require social distancing within those establishments.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "revcomblogtranscriptscaliforniagovernorgavinnewsomcoronaviruspressconferenceannouncesclosureofbarsacrossstate", "title": "California Governor Gavin Newsom Coronavirus Press Conference: Announces Closure of Bars Across State", "source": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/california-governor-gavin-newsom-coronavirus-press-conference-announces-closure-of-bars-across-state", "publication_date": "15-03-2020", "crawling_date": "03-07-2023", "politician": ["Gavin Newsom"], "gender": ["M"]}}

So that is on the restaurant side. Let me just briefly make this point. There is a concern around access to food for those that cannot prepare their own food. Not everybody has kind of kitchen you or I may have, not everybody is capable of heating their food. Now we are talking about home isolation. Not everybody is able now to go out to grocery store to get that food. Some may have limited capacities relates to deliveries, but we want to expand the points of access to get those deliveries. Restaurants by definition provide those points of access. So having an organized construct that allows delivery of hot, prepared and nutritious food within an existing infrastructure we think is appropriate again to this moment with the additional steps on bars, nightclubs, wineries, brew pubs and the like. Number three, in relationship to seniors as our top priority and home isolation, as it relates to bars and new guidelines on restaurants, I referenced the issue of homelessness. This is a top concern in the State of California in the abstract. We have 108,000 unsheltered homeless individuals in the State of California. We need to meet this moment aggressively, and I can assure you, I mentioned 13 of our task force teams that are residing in this building, they are our teams just working 24/7 on this issue to get people out of encampments and get people into environments where we can address their growing anxiety and our growing concern about the health of some of our most vulnerable Californians out in the streets and sidewalks. We are in real time procuring hotels and motels to convert to appropriate sites. We have just identified as Just an example, this is not even close to the magnitude of what we are proposing, but it is just a point of consideration and a proof point to give you a sense of what we are doing.

So that is another area of deep and disproportionate emphasis that also we are advancing as a directive. As it relates to, again, vulnerable populations, you saw yesterday we put out guidance as it relates to an executive order directing along the lines of what the CDC and others have been recommending. We codified that in the State of California on visitation in our senior facilities, our skilled nursing facilities, our assisted living facilities. We now are tightening those directives to just end of life visitation, and that includes hospitals, not just congregate living facilities in the state. That is also a part of what we are advancing here today. So that gives you a sense of some of the current thinking of our healthcare professionals. We have our finance team here and others in this building. We are gaming out the financial impacts, not just to the state's budget, but with disproportionate focus on families and individual budgets. This is a very different challenge, a very different crisis, and we need to meet this moment even different than we did in the 2008, 2009 years. We have to really focus on individual, so looking at our unemployment insurance or disability insurance, looking at how we can compliment what was done at the federal level. We are also sharpening our focus on what we request of the federal government going forward as we believe the extraordinary work that has been done by Speaker Pelosi and her colleagues, and we hope soon by the United States Senate can be complimented with even more support that we think is necessary to meet this moment. In more parochial, for some more pedestrian issues related to our work with the California legislature, we are in real time conversations with the legislature about our current budget and how we will process the concerns and anxieties people have about business as usual and environment where business cannot be as usual and we will be making announcements on that in the next number of days, probably the next number of hours potentially, and certainly tomorrow.

But we are in that range of 80% to 85% of all of our kids are no longer going to school starting tomorrow on the basis of 51% of the districts shutting down, meaning the largest districts in the state. 24 out of 25 of the largest districts in the State of California have already shut down. The one remaining in that group is current high school district which has remained open. Many smaller districts remain open and for reasons that are perfectly understandable. On Tuesday, we will be putting out very detailed guidelines for those schools that remained open and continue to remain and are likely to remain open and those that have closed. We are vetting and curating and validating all kinds of private and public sector solutions to address the following and obvious real problems. How you feed people that cannot be fed otherwise because they are on free or reduced, not just lunch but also free or reduced breakfast. Some districts, 80%, some districts even higher, of their children meet that criteria 60% throughout our entire educational system. It is one thing to say you have a plan, it is another to actually deliver on that plan and with respect, not everybody that closed had that plan. So we are making sure we supplement that, take responsibility to meet that moment. That is transportation issue, that is a logistics issue, that is a siting issue, parks, libraries where we provide those supports. We also work with the private sector, and I must call out a Chef Jose who was there at the Grand Princess and is here in this conversation working with his organization to provide nutritious meal alternatives as well and to help us with the logistics and the distribution of food sites throughout the State of California. But we have particular concern, in addition to that, for special needs children, and this is something personal that I know all of us that have any empathy and capacity, as someone whose mother worked for Aid to Adoption of Special Kids, this is how I grew up with a deep consciousness and mindset for those with physical as well as cognitive disabilities.

So that is what this planning process has been about. On Tuesday, we will lay out in detailed terms what that vetted and curated process and the protocols we want to establish look like from a very bottom up, not top down perspective, meaning districts and rural parts of the state operate very differently as it relates to community assets than some on the coast with large social safety nets. So we have to meet the needs of all of our diverse communities in a nation state with six plus million children, and I should just note the first six states that announced they were shutting down their education system combined did not even have as many children as we do in the State of California. It gives you a sense of the magnitude of the number of children that we are needing to address, that again puts a real burden on trying to orient an appropriate response to meet this moment. The superintendent of public education, I have been working very collaborative with us, our health and human service agencies and our logistics teams that also are represented in those 13 task forces that are included upstairs and in that total package in those numbers that I just referenced. So that is it on the schools, a little bit on our new advisories on bars and restaurants on social isolation home isolation for our 65 and older population and those with chronic disease. The fairly partnership that we are advancing, which we are very enthusiastic about and we hope is a model to this country, and then of course an update on the numbers of people that currently have tested positive. In closing, we anticipate as these tests significantly ramp up, the number of those by definition change the numerator, denominator, number of people will test positive.

We are in deep negotiations, and forgive me when you ask which specific sites are there, we are in deep negotiations to secure those sites. As soon as they are secured and the negotiations are complete, within the next number of days, we will announce those publicly. We are also looking on the basis of the work we are doing to triage the situation, not looking at the world in the aggregate but looking at the world as it exists within our diverse communities, meaning we may have a system that includes some 74,000 hospital beds but not every community has adequate number of beds. So we are looking to site our focus and our energies to increase capacity in those communities that need it the most. So it is , yes, North and South, but it is also from a regional basis, looking at other parts of the state to the inland part of the state, not just in Coastal California. I am in particular, and I think I can say this on behalf of Mark and others by the advanced negotiations on sizable assets that could be brought on line. Hundreds and hundreds, in fact, I can say this. A minimum 750 beds that will get up if these negotiations are successful just by the end of the week in world-class settings, and we have identified many other additional sites that we are also initiating conversations.

We are also modern partners--ready to stand together before the challenges that face us in modern times. The United States has proposed that all nations unite in a worldwide war on hunger. From our talks today, I am more confident than ever that our friends in Morocco are committed to that struggle. As I said this morning in receiving His Majesty, our ultimate task is to create among the nations of the world a community of peace. I often read and reread Article I of the United Nations Charter. I believe all of us-and especially those of you who are too young to know how the world felt in 1945--should come to know it line by line. collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace; --collective measures for the suppression of acts of aggression; --adjustment or settlement of international disputes by peaceful means; --the development of friendly relations among nations based upon respect for the principle of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples; --international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character; and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion. In those years Americans have taken more than 200,000 casualties in collective measures to suppress acts of aggression. All of us, working together, at different times and in different places, have made sure that aggression did not succeed. The chances for world security are larger, and the hope for world peace is nearer, because tonight aggression has not succeeded. Meanwhile, in lands and nations throughout the world much has been done to lift the standards of living. In Western Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia, cooperation in economic and social progress is no longer just a matter of words.

At the present time, the time characterized by an increase in problems which are so great and serious that they seem sometimes very difficult to solve, we deem it most beneficial that chiefs of state should get together from time to time. This we deem essential because we believe that as a result of their meetings and direct discussions, bonds of cooperation among nations grow stronger on the one hand, and, on the other, the chances for peace in the world become greater. It is this belief which has prompted us ever since our accession to the throne to visit on a number of continents the chiefs of state whose systems and customs differ from ours. We have seen that differences in systems and differences between races and cultures do not necessarily make it impossible to bring about a rapprochement of points of view, nor do they necessarily prevent the achievement of desired objectives. It is our pleasure to be visiting again today this friendly country and to meet His Excellency, the ENTITY, Mr. Johnson, knowing that our meeting each other will definitely open up before us wider and greater horizons for a free collaboration and cooperation in the interest of our two peoples. We aspire to benefit from the experience of the people of the United States, which has become an example and an ideal in progress in the economic, agricultural, and industrial development fields.

{"id": 5944, "text": "Well, we have just held a very useful and, I might say, brief but also, I will add, a very moving discussion with Chairman Yunis Khalis of the Islamic Union of Mujahidin of Afghanistan and other members of his distinguished delegation. I expressed our nation's continued strong support for the resistance and our satisfaction with the large step the Afghan resistance took toward unity in choosing a chairman for the first time. This new political milestone demonstrates that the people of Afghanistan speak with one voice in their opposition to the Soviet invasion and occupation of their homeland. This increasing unity has already made itself felt on the battlefield. During the past 18 months, the Mujahidin fighting inside the country have improved their weapons, tactics, and coordination. The result has been a string of serious defeats for the Soviet elite units as well as many divisions from the Kabul army. Chairman Khalis and his delegation are visiting Washington, following the November 10th U.N. General Assembly vote, which with a record vote, once again, called overwhelmingly for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan. This is the eighth time since the December 1979 invasion that the General Assembly has decisively called upon the Soviet Union to pull its forces out of Afghanistan. The withdrawal of Soviet forces is the key to resolving the Afghan crisis. Other issues that have been raised to divert attention from this fact only extend the combat and prolong the suffering of the Afghan people. General Secretary Gorbachev has publicly stated a Soviet readiness to withdraw. Both in April and September of 1987, I asked the Soviet Union to set a date this year when that withdrawal would begin. I also stated that when the Soviet Union showed convincingly that it was ready for a genuine political settlement the United States would be helpful. After all, the Soviet presence in Afghanistan is a major impediment to improved U.S.-Soviet relations, and we would like to remove it. Unfortunately, the Soviet answer on a date for rapid withdrawal has been silence. Instead we have seen the Kabul regime announce a phantom cease-fire and propose a transitional government, one that would leave this discredited and doomed group in control. that of the Afghan people, speaking through their resistance representatives. Any proposal unacceptable to the resistance is destined to fail. And as the resistance continues the fight, we and other responsible governments will stand by it. The support that the United States has been providing the resistance will be strengthened, rather than diminished, so that it can continue to fight effectively for freedom.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingmeetingwithafghanresistanceleadersandmemberscongress", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Afghan Resistance Leaders and Members of Congress", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-meeting-with-afghan-resistance-leaders-and-members-congress", "publication_date": "12-11-1987", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

We have got a few fires to put out around here, and that is why I have been late. More than 2,100,000 fires broke out in the U.S. this year, claiming 6,000 lives. Fires strike at the most vulnerable among us, especially children and the elderly. And it also strikes the most valiant among us; many casualties are, indeed, the firefighters who lose their lives in a last-ditch struggle to save someone else's life. Then, after the cost in lives, we have got to count the enormous property losses in excess of $8 billion. Now, these dollars cannot adequately represent the tragedy of so many beloved homes, churches, and businesses literally going up in smoke. the more than 1 million firefighters. The organizations involved in fire prevention efforts are too numerous to mention. But all are true heroes, and their heroic role is on display here today for National Fire Prevention Week. At the Federal level, the U.S. Fire Administration, part of FEMA, is the national leader in firefighting and emergency response. These men and women from the Fire Administration are dedicated to the development of effective programs to help fire departments, State and local governments, private business and organizations, and educators promote fire safety and awareness in communities across the country. At the State level, many dedicated agencies labor to provide training courses for firefighters and emergency medical technicians, arson investigation services, and research. And of course, in virtually every community across this great country are the men and women who make up the front lines in the battle, the firefighters, both career and volunteers, who continue a long and distinguished tradition of firefighting that goes back all the way to the first volunteer fire company founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1736. Congress also has a role to play through the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, whose cochairmen are Senator McCain and Congressman Curt Weldon. The caucus boasts 370 Congressmen and Senators 370 making it the largest on Capitol Hill. Most of all, Congress recently updated our safety laws in the Hotel-Motel Fire Safety Act, authored by Congressman Sherry Boehlert.

And I thank Alan Solomont for his work. And I thank all of you for your support. I have just come from an event for Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota. You know, North Dakota is a State that is so small, I felt like a sophisticate from Arkansas being there. And it is one of the few delegations that is completely Democratic, even though the State always votes Republican in Presidential elections. They have two Democratic Senators and a Democratic Congressman. And the first time Byron Dorgan ran for Congress was in 1974, the first year I ran for public office. And I told him that it took all three of them to lose that race, and I lost mine all by myself. But it was a very interesting and heartening event, because I was thinking about Byron Dorgan and Kent and Earl, and I was thinking that if any of those three had either not been there or had not been willing to put their necks on the line, we would not have passed the budget in 1993. And we would have not reversed trickle-down economics, or in a less pejorative term, we would not have reversed supply-side economics. And because we did, in an economic plan that invested in our children and our technology, in a fairer tax system for working people, 4 1/2 years later or 4 years later, we have got 11 1/2 million jobs, the first time any administration, period, had produced that much; 63 percent decline in the deficit; lowest rates of unemployment and inflation combined since the 1960's. That is what this party is about, and do not ever forget that. I will tell you a little thing. Today I got a letter from a woman that I know from Iowa. I met her in Cedar Rapids in 1992.

She adopted a child when she had been left by her husband. She was raising two children on her own, her own children. She had barely enough money to put body and soul together. And she was at a political rally because she thought it was important for her future. And she has struggled to keep that little baby alive for 4 years.

And all those things in the middle, that is really what this is all about. And we can never forget that what we do affects real people in real lives. So when we replaced trickle-down economics with invest-and-grow economics, we gave Americans a chance to have a better future. When we got away from hot rhetoric and got down to concrete action on social problems and we reversed the social decline, working with people all over America to get the crime rate down and the biggest drop in welfare rolls in history, we helped to give people a better future.

I can say that this administration has done more to reduce the size of Government and the number of regulations and the burden of it than our Republican predecessors, but we never could figure out how to use the rhetoric to convince the American people that the Government that they elected and paid for was their enemy inherently.

{"id": 5965, "text": "Tonight I want to take a few minutes to discuss a grave threat to peace and America's determination to lead the world in confronting that threat. The threat comes from Iraq. It arises directly from the Iraqi regime's own actions-its history of aggression and its drive toward an arsenal of terror. Eleven years ago, as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf war, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons, and to stop all support for terrorist groups. The Iraqi regime has violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter and support to terrorism and practices terror against its own people. The entire world has witnessed Iraq's 11-year history of defiance, deception, and bad faith. We must also never forget the most vivid events of recent history. On September the 11th, 2001, America felt its vulnerability, even to threats that gather on the other side of the Earth. We resolved then and we are resolved today to confront every threat, from any source, that could bring sudden terror and suffering to America. Members of Congress of both political parties and members of the United Nations Security Council agree that Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace and must disarm. We agree that the Iraqi dictator must not be permitted to threaten America and the world with horrible poisons and diseases and gases and atomic weapons. How can we best achieve it? Many Americans have raised legitimate questions about the nature of the threat, about the urgency of action-why be concerned now-about the link between Iraq developing weapons of terror and the wider war on terror. These are all issues we have discussed broadly and fully within my administration. And tonight I want to share those discussions with you. First, some ask why Iraq is different from other countries or regimes that also have terrible weapons. While there are many dangers in the world, the threat from Iraq stands alone because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place. Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant who has already used chemical weapons to kill thousands of people. This same tyrant has tried to dominate the Middle East, has invaded and brutally occupied a small neighbor, has struck other nations without warning, and holds an unrelenting hostility toward the United States. By its past and present actions, by its technological capabilities, by the merciless nature of its regime, Iraq is unique.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthenationiraqfromcincinnatiohio", "title": "George W.

{"id": 5966, "text": "As a former chief weapons inspector of the U.N. has said, The fundamental problem with Iraq remains the nature of the regime, itself. Saddam Hussein is a homicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction. Some ask how urgent this danger is to America and the world. The danger is already significant, and it only grows worse with time. If we know Saddam Hussein has dangerous weapons today-and we do-does it make any sense for the world to wait to confront him as he grows even stronger and develops even more dangerous weapons? In 1995, after several years of deceit by the Iraqi regime, the head of Iraq's military industries defected. It was then that the regime was forced to admit that it had produced more than 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents. The inspectors, however, concluded that Iraq had likely produced 2 to 4 times that amount. This is a massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never been accounted for and is capable of killing millions. We know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, VX nerve gas. Saddam Hussein also has experience in using chemical weapons. He has ordered chemical attacks on Iran and on more than 40 villages in his own country. These actions killed or injured at least 20,000 people, more than 6 times the number of people who died in the attacks of September the 11th. And surveillance photos reveal that the regime is rebuilding facilities that it had used to produce chemical and biological weapons. Every chemical and biological weapon that Iraq has or makes is a direct violation of the truce that ended the Persian Gulf war in 1991. Yet, Saddam Hussein has chosen to build and keep these weapons despite international sanctions, U.N. demands, and isolation from the civilized world. Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds of miles-far enough to strike Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, and other nations-in a region where more than 135,000 American civilians and service members live and work. We have also discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or biological weapons across broad areas. We are concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using these UAVs for missions targeting the United States. And of course, sophisticated delivery systems are not required for a chemical or biological attack; all that might be required are a small container and one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative to deliver it.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthenationiraqfromcincinnatiohio", "title": "George W.

{"id": 5967, "text": "And that is the source of our urgent concern about Saddam Hussein's links to international terrorist groups. Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror organization carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans. Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. And we know that Iraq is continuing to finance terror and gives assistance to groups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace. We know that Iraq and the Al Qaida terrorist network share a common enemy- the United States of America. We know that Iraq and Al Qaida have had high-level contacts that go back a decade. Some Al Qaida leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq. These include one very senior Al Qaida leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year, and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks. We have learned that Iraq has trained Al Qaida members in bombmaking and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September the 11th, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America. Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists. Alliance with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints. Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war against terror. When I spoke to Congress more than a year ago, I said that those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. Saddam Hussein is harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror, the instruments of mass death and destruction. The risk is simply too great that he will use them or provide them to a terror network. Terror cells and outlaw regimes building weapons of mass destruction are different faces of the same evil. Our security requires that we confront both, and the United States military is capable of confronting both. Many people have asked how close Saddam Hussein is to developing a nuclear weapon. Before the Gulf war, the best intelligence indicated that Iraq was 8 to 10 years away from developing a nuclear weapon. After the war, international inspectors learned that the regime had been much closer-the regime in Iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthenationiraqfromcincinnatiohio", "title": "George W.

{"id": 5968, "text": "The inspectors discovered that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a workable nuclear weapon, and was pursuing several different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. Before being barred from Iraq in 1998, the International Atomic Energy Agency dismantled extensive nuclear weapons-related facilities, including three uranium enrichment sites. That same year, information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue. The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. Saddam Hussein has held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group he calls his nuclear mujahideen, his nuclear holy warriors. Satellite photographs reveal that Iraq is rebuilding facilities at sites that have been part of its nuclear program in the past. Iraq has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes and other equipment needed for gas centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year. Saddam Hussein would be in a position to blackmail anyone who opposes his aggression. He would be in a position to dominate the Middle East. He would be in a position to threaten America. And Saddam Hussein would be in a position to pass nuclear technology to terrorists. Some citizens wonder, after 11 years of living with this problem, why do we need to confront it now? We have experienced the horror of September the 11th. We have seen that those who hate America are willing to crash airplanes into buildings full of innocent people. Our enemies would be no less willing-in fact, they would be eager-to use biological or chemical or a nuclear weapon. Knowing these realities, America must not ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun, that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud. As President Kennedy said in October of 1962, Neither the United States of America nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or small. We no longer live in a world, he said, where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge to a nation's security to constitute maximum peril.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthenationiraqfromcincinnatiohio", "title": "George W.

Some believe we can address this danger by simply resuming the old approach to inspections and applying diplomatic and economic pressure. Yet this is precisely what the world has tried to do since 1991. The U.N. inspections program was met with systematic deception. The Iraqi regime bugged hotel rooms and offices of inspectors to find where they were going next. They forged documents, destroyed evidence, and developed mobile weapons facilities to keep a step ahead of inspectors. Eight so-called Presidential palaces were declared off-limits to unfettered inspections. These sites actually encompass 12 square miles, with hundreds of structures, both above and below the ground, where sensitive materials could be hidden. The world has also tried economic sanctions and watched Iraq use billions of dollars in illegal oil revenues to fund more weapons purchases, rather than providing for the needs of the Iraqi people. The world has tried limited military strikes to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities, only to see them openly rebuilt, while the regime again denies they even exist. The world has tried no-fly zones to keep Saddam from terrorizing his own people, and in the last year alone, the Iraqi military has fired upon American and British pilots more than 750 times. After 11 years during which we have tried containment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon. America wants the U.N. to be an effective organization that helps keep the peace. And that is why we are urging the Security Council to adopt a new resolution setting out tough, immediate requirements. Among those requirements, the Iraqi regime must reveal and destroy, under U.N. supervision, all existing weapons of mass destruction. To ensure that we learn the truth, the regime must allow witnesses to its illegal activities to be interviewed outside the country, and these witnesses must be free to bring their families with them so they are all beyond the reach of Saddam Hussein's terror and murder. And inspectors must have access to any site, at any time, without preclearance, without delay, without exceptions.

Many nations are joining us in insisting that Saddam Hussein's regime be held accountable. They are committed to defending the international security that protects the lives of both our citizens and theirs. And that is why America is challenging all nations to take the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council seriously. In addition to declaring and destroying all of its weapons of mass destruction, Iraq must end its support for terrorism. It must cease the persecution of its civilian population. It must stop all illicit trade outside the oilfor-food program. It must release or account for all Gulf war personnel, including an American pilot whose fate is still unknown. By taking these steps and by only taking these steps, the Iraqi regime has an opportunity to avoid conflict. America hopes the regime will make that choice. Unfortunately, at least so far, we have little reason to expect it. And that is why two administrations, mine and President Clinton's, have stated that regime change in Iraq is the only certain means of removing a great danger to our Nation. I hope this will not require military action, but it may. An Iraqi regime faced with its own demise may attempt cruel and desperate measures. If Saddam Hussein orders such measures, his generals would be well advised to refuse those orders. If we have to act, we will take every precaution that is possible. We will act with the full power of the United States military. We will act with allies at our side, and we will prevail. In my view, it is the riskiest of all options, because the longer we wait, the stronger and bolder Saddam Hussein will become. We could wait and hope that Saddam does not give weapons to terrorists or develop a nuclear weapon to blackmail the world. But I am convinced that is a hope against all evidence. As Americans, we want peace; we work and sacrifice for peace. But there can be no peace if our security depends on the will and whims of a ruthless and aggressive dictator. I am not willing to stake one American life on trusting Saddam Hussein. Failure to act would embolden other tyrants, allow terrorists access to new weapons and new resources, and make blackmail a permanent feature of world events. The United Nations would betray the purpose of its founding and prove irrelevant to the problems of our time.

Some worry that a change of leadership in Iraq could create instability and make the situation worse. The situation could hardly get worse for world security and for the people of Iraq. The lives of Iraqi citizens would improve dramatically if Saddam Hussein were no longer in power, just as the lives of Afghanistan's citizens improved after the Taliban. The dictator of Iraq is a student of Stalin, using murder as a tool of terror and control, within his own cabinet, within his own army, and even within his own family. On Saddam Hussein's orders, opponents have been decapitated, wives and mothers of political opponents have been systematically raped as a method of intimidation, and political prisoners have been forced to watch their own children being tortured. America believes that all people are entitled to hope and human rights, to the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity. People everywhere prefer freedom to slavery, prosperity to squalor, self-government to the rule of terror and torture. America is a friend to the people of Iraq. Our demands are directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens us. When these demands are met, the first and greatest benefit will come to Iraqi men, women, and children. The oppression of Kurds, Assyrians, Turkomans, Shi'a, Sunnis, and others will be lifted. The long captivity of Iraq will end, and an era of new hope will begin.

I want to begin with a word about Admiral Mike Boorda, our Chief of Naval Operations, who died this afternoon. His death is a great loss, not just for the Navy and our Armed Forces but for our entire country. Mike Boorda was the very first enlisted man in the history of our country to rise to become Chief of Naval Operations. He brought extraordinary energy and dedication and good humor to every post he held in a long and distinguished career. From Southeast Asia to Europe, he devoted his life to serving our Nation. I am personally grateful for the central role he played in planning our mission in Bosnia, both when he commanded our forces in southeastern Europe and later when he came here to Washington. He was known for his professionalism and skill. But what distinguished him above all else was his unwavering concern for the welfare of the men and women who serve the United States in our Navy. We will all remember him for that, and much else. Our hearts and prayers go out to his family, to his wife, Bettie, and his children, David, Edward, Anna, and Robert. And I'd like to ask everyone to just join me now in a moment of silence in memory of Admiral Mike Boorda. Today I am launching an international effort to ban antipersonnel landmines. For decades the world has been struck with horror at the devastations that landmines cause. Boys and girls at play, farmers tending their fields, ordinary travelers-in all, more than 25,000 people a year are maimed or killed by mines left behind when wars ended. We must act so that the children of the world can walk without fear on the earth beneath them. To end this carnage, the United States will seek a worldwide agreement as soon as possible to end the use of all antipersonnel landmines. The United States will lead a global effort to eliminate these terrible weapons and to stop the enormous loss of human life. The steps I announced today build on the work we have done to clear mines in 14 nations, from Bosnia to Afghanistan, from Cambodia to Namibia.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheantipersonnellandminesinitiative", "title": "Remarks on the Antipersonnel Landmines Initiative", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-antipersonnel-landmines-initiative", "publication_date": "16-05-1996", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

To pursue our goal of a worldwide ban, today I order several unilateral actions. First, I am directing that effective immediately, our Armed Forces discontinue the use of all so-called dumb antipersonnel mines, those which remain active until detonated or cleared. The only exception will be for those mines required to defend our American troops and our allies from aggression on the Korean Peninsula and those needed for training purposes. The rest of these mines, more than 4 million in all, will be removed from our arsenals and destroyed by 1999. Just as the world has a responsibility to see to it that a child in Cambodia can walk to school in safety, as Commander in Chief, my responsibility is also to safeguard the safety, the lives of our men and women in uniform. Because of the continued and unique threat of aggression in the Korean Peninsula, I have therefore decided that in any negotiations on a ban, the United States will and must protect our rights to use the mines there. We will do so until the threat is ended or until alternatives to landmines become available. Until an international ban takes effect, the United States will reserve the right to use socalled smart mines or self-destructing mines as necessary, because there may be battlefield situations in which these will save lives of our soldiers. Let me emphasize, these smart mines are not the hidden killers that have caused so much suffering around the world. They meet standards set by international agreement. They destroy themselves within days, and they pose virtually no threat to civilian life once a battle is over. But under the comprehensive international ban we seek, use of even these smart antipersonnel mines would also be ended. We are determined that lands around the world will never again be sown with terror. That is why I will propose a resolution at the 51st United Nations General Assembly this fall, urging the nations of the world to support a worldwide ban on landmines. I have instructed Ambassador Albright to begin work now on this resolution. Third, while the exceptions I have mentioned are necessary to protect American lives, I am determined to end our reliance on these weapons completely.

To help end the anguish they cause, the Department of Defense will expand its efforts to develop better mine detection and mine-clearing technology for use in the many countries that are still plagued by mines. We will also strengthen our programs for training and assisting other nations as they strive to rid their territory of these devices. For these efforts, as well as those to develop alternatives to antipersonnel mines, we will assure sufficient funding. I will personally work with Congress on this issue. Many have worked to bring us to this moment. I especially want to say a word of thanks to Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Although I know he has differences with our approach, his dedication and his moral leadership on this issue have played a vital role in alerting the conscience of our Nation to the suffering that landmines cause. I also want to thank the many nongovernmental organizations that have worked so hard to put this issue at the top of the international agenda. As we turn to the task of achieving a worldwide ban, we must work together, and we will be successful.

I looked over your schedule and I hope from the distinguished speakers that spoke with you that you have had an informative briefing session, not only with Secretary Kleppe but the others--those who were responsible for some of the Government Indian programs. I think it is vitally important that you tell us what your problems are, what your needs are, and then we can be fully informed as to the right policies and the right programs. Let me take just a few minutes to talk with you on a personal basis, to let you know of my personal concern for the needs of Indians and Native Americans. The Federal Government has a very unique relationship with you and your people. It is a relationship of a legal trust and a high moral responsibility. That relationship is rooted deep in history, but it is fed today by our concern that the Indian people should enjoy the same opportunities as other Americans, while maintaining the culture and the traditions that you rightly prize as your heritage. That heritage is an important part of the American culture that we are celebrating in this great country in our Bicentennial Year. Your ancestors introduced settlers not only to new foods and new plants but to Indian ways of life and Indian values which they absorbed. This is a year for all of us to realize what a great debt we individually and collectively owe to the American Indians. Today you are concerned about such serious problems as poverty, unemployment, crime, poor health, and unsuitable housing on Indian reservations. I share your concern. I am hopeful about the future and about what we can achieve by continuing to work together. The 1970's have brought a new era in Indian affairs. In the last century, Federal policy has vacillated between paternalism and the threat of terminating Federal responsibility. I am opposed to both extremes. I believe in maintaining a stable policy so that Indians and Indian leaders can plan and work confidently for the future.

They have solicited the views of the Indian community in preparing their recommendations, which I will soon send to the Congress. I am committed to furthering the self-determination of Indian communities but without terminating the special relationship between the Federal Government and the Indian people. I am strongly opposed to termination. Self-determination means that you can decide the nature of your tribe's relationship with the Federal Government within the framework of the Self-Determination Act, which I signed in January of 1975. Indian tribes, if they desire, now have the opportunity to administer Federal programs for themselves. We can then work together as partners. On your part, this requires initiative and responsibility as you define your tribal goals and determine how you want to use the Federal resources. On the Federal Government's part, self-determination for Indian tribes requires that Federal programs must be flexible enough to deal with the different needs and desires of individual tribes. In the past, our flexibility has been limited by the lack of effective coordination among departments and agencies offering a wide variety of programs and services to the Indian people.

Since you were born, man has developed both the capacity to destroy human life and the capacity to make life worthwhile for all the human race.

You are challenged not to serve the mediocre and the mundane, but to work toward the great and toward the grand. In our cities and in our countrysides, you will participate in the building of the second America--just as you will also be partners in building the first world of universal peace and justice and freedom. Today's vote terminating debate in the United States Senate on the civil rights bill is an historic event. Today's action demonstrates that the national will manifests itself in congressional action. One year ago tomorrow, President Kennedy in a radio and television report to the American people, declared, A great change is at hand and our task and our obligation is to make that revolution, that change, peaceful and constructive for all. Today's action by the United States Senate is a major contribution to meeting this national responsibility. That is your challenge--to give your talents and your time in our land and in all lands to cleaning away the blight, to sweeping away the shoddiness, to wiping away the injustices and the inequities of the past so that all men may live together in a great world community of decency and of excellence. What you accomplish as individuals-what all of us accomplish as a Nation--depends upon the goals and the values by which we challenge ourselves. The average and the adequate are too low as goals for Americans. Our society and its members must aim for, and reach toward, the goals and the values of excellence. By the standards that you set, by the services that you render, you will show the world that when the doors of equal opportunity are kept open in our democracy young men and young women will respond with an instinct for excellence such as history has never known. I congratulate you, each of you, for what you have achieved. I am so proud of you. I honor you for what I know you, and your generation, will achieve in the years to come.

I am here to talk about one of the reasons why health care costs are going up. And that is the fact that we have got too many darn lawsuits, too many frivolous and junk lawsuits that are affecting people. I am here to make sure that we talk in a way that says to the people of Arkansas and America that we need medical liability reform to make sure that medicine is affordable and available. But I am here, first and foremost, to thank the people of this medical center, those here in person and those listening via cable. I want to thank you for what you do. I want to thank you for your heart. I want to thank you for caring about your fellow citizens. I appreciate very much your being on the frontline of healing, healing lives in such a compassionate way. Our health care system is the best in the world, and we need to keep it that way. I appreciate Russ. Thank you for joining us in-we just had what they call a roundtable. But nevertheless, we had a great discussion, and Russ was there. He talked about this hospital, its outreach, its not only desire to serve people in the city of Little Rock but also its desire to serve people in rural Arkansas. I want to thank Doug Weeks, the senior vice president and administrator, our host. I want to thank my friend the Governor for coming. Part of good health care depends on how you treat your own body. The best way to-one of the best ways to prevent disease is to make right choices. One of the right choices is to watch what you eat. The Governor has clearly done that. He is setting a good example. Some of us like to run-or used to like to run before we broke down. And I hope people in Arkansas and around the country understand that the exercise is a good way to avoid disease in the first place.

Before I get into the issue of health, I do want to remind you that our country still faces big challenges. And we are rising to meet the challenges. The most important job of my administration is to protect the American people, is to chase down those who would do us harm and bring them to justice, is to never forget the lessons of September the 11th, is to stay on the offensive, and that is what we are doing. We are spreading freedom, and as we do so, the world becomes more peaceful. Freedom is not America's gift to the world; freedom is the Almighty's gift to each man and woman in the world. I appreciate so very much the contribution of the Arkansas Guard. Over 4,000 troops are part of our effort to not only make America more secure but to make the world more free. I know that the Governor informed me that these troops are ready to go. They understand the mission. They are proud to serve our country. I am proud to call them-I am proud to be their Commander in Chief. And I want their families to know how much we are grateful for their sacrifice as well. Arkansas ought to be proud of the men and women who wear the uniform, and they are going to make this Nation proud and more secure in their sacrifices. I told everybody the other night at the State of the Union that we are going to stay on the offensive against Al Qaida, and we are making good progress. We are on an international manhunt. We are in a different kind of war. It used to be in the old days, you could measure progress based upon the number of airplanes that the enemy had or the number of ships in a flotilla. And the big battles of the past were clashes of equipment that were visible for people to see. And this is the kind of war where sometimes you see action, and sometimes you do not .

Hassan Ghul was a-reported directly to Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who was the mastermind of the September the 11th attacks. He was moving money and messages around South Asia and the Middle East to other Al Qaida leaders. He was a part of this network of haters that we are dismantling. Our intelligence officers did a good job. He was captured in Iraq, where he was helping Al Qaida to put pressure on our troops. There is one less enemy we have to worry about with the capture of Hassan Ghul. Our people are doing great work. This country's economy is getting better, and that is positive news for the people of Arkansas and the people of America. See, I believe that when people have more money in their pocket, they will then spend or save or invest, and that causes the whole economy to grow, which then helps people find a job. Much of the tax relief we passed is set to expire, and it is set to expire right about the time the economy gets going. It makes no sense to have a tax increase on the American people at this stage or any stage as far as I am concerned. In order to make this tax relief permanent, let people keep more of their own money to keep driving this economy forward. Small businesses need to keep more money. You see, most new jobs in America are created by small-business owners. If you are worried about job creation, we need to continue to stimulate the small-business sector of our economy. They need to make these tax relief packages we passed for small business permanent so people can find work here in America. We also need to have an energy policy. The people of Arkansas understand energy. We need a policy. We need a policy that encourages conservation. We need a policy that helps modernize our electricity systems, and we need a policy that makes us less dependent on foreign sources of energy. We need to open up markets for Arkansas' farmers and ranchers. When you are good at something, we ought to encourage the sale of those products elsewhere, outside of our markets.

{"id": 5990, "text": "We need less regulation for businesses and small businesses. And we have got to deal with rising health care costs. Rising health care costs are making it difficult for some entities to hire people. Rising health care costs affect all Americans. Rising health care costs create insecurity in our Nation. And so we need to continue the focus on costs. We are making some good progress, by the way, about helping people with health care. We have got what we call community health centers in America. I am committed to the expansion and the building of new community health centers. These are places where people who do not have insurance or live in areas without enough doctors can find health care. Community health centers make sense. It takes the pressure off the emergency rooms of hospitals such as this. We have opened or expanded 600 community health centers since 2001. This is a good way to make sure that health care is available for those who do not have insurance yet. And so I call upon Congress to look at that part of my budget and continue working with the administration to expand these vital centers around Arkansas and around America. And then we worked on Medicare. You might remember what it was like before this year when people talked about Medicare. If somebody would talk about it, somebody else would say, Wait a minute. They are going to try to take away Medicare from the seniors. I felt like we needed to deal with the issue now and not pass it on like other Congresses and administrations had done. It is time to address the issue before it became so acute that the system did not work. And it was time to fulfill a promise to our seniors, and so we acted. I was proud to sign that bill, and as I told the Congress, If you try to change it and it hurts our seniors, I will veto the bill. It is going to take a while to implement the Medicare bill. It is a complex piece of legislation. After all, it is the first modernization since Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare in the mid-sixties. This year, seniors are going to get a drug discount card, which will save them 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of most prescription drugs. And the lowest income seniors will get a $600 credit. That will help seniors with drug costs. Secondly, next year we will begin preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease for seniors just entering Medicare, plus they will get a wellness exam. It is the first time that Medicare has actually been into the business of preventive screenings.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkslittlerockarkansas2", "title": "Remarks in Little Rock, Arkansas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-little-rock-arkansas-2", "publication_date": "26-01-2004", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

{"id": 5991, "text": "Any good doc will tell you, you need to figure out what the issue is in order to deal with people. And a preventive screening will help the medical profession better treat our seniors. Finally, in year 2006, seniors will receive the prescription drug coverage they have been promised. For about $35 a month, most seniors will see their drug bills cut in half. That is a good deal for America's seniors. And finally, in the bill is an interesting innovation, one that is not the first time it is been tried, but it is now been expanded- they are called health savings accounts, which will allow Americans to save for future medical expenses, tax-free. Another way to help, by the way-or a way to help deal with rising costs is to understand the impact rising costs have on small businesses. A lot of big businesses are able to absorb the costs because they have got the capacity to negotiate better. When you have got a large universe of people that you are trying to cover, you can have more strength in negotiations. It gives you a better hand. The problem we have with small businesses is they do not have the capacity to pool together, to negotiate on behalf of a lot of people. And that is why I am a strong supporter of what is called association health plans that will allow small businesses to pool risk and have a better negotiation policy with those who offer insurance. Congress needs to pass this piece of legislation. It is good for the entrepreneurs of Arkansas. Lower income Americans should be helped with health care by refundable tax credits. It is been a part of my budget. It will help with the issue of the uninsured. People with health savings accounts, when they buy high deductible insurance policies to protect them against catastrophic medical costs or hospitalization or major surgery, should be allowed to deduct those premiums. See, that will help with the rising costs of health care as well. Those are some practical suggestions for Congress to look at, ways to strengthen the private delivery of medicine as opposed to strengthening the Government involvement in medicine. There is something else we can do at the Federal level, and that is to promote promising health information technology. The truth of the matter is, medicine is on the leading edge of change. And some of the new drugs are fantastic about-to help save lives. Some of the new machinery is fantastic.

Well, what we need to do is to have standards and computerized records so that we can improve care and prevent errors, which will save money in the system. There is tremendous savings to be had by bringing technology into the medical field, and the Federal Government can help there as well. Yet one of the main cost-drivers, that has nothing to do with what happens in an operating room or a waiting room, happen in the courtroom. One of the reasons people are finding their premiums are up and it is hard to find a doc these days is because frivolous and junk lawsuits are threatening medicine across the country. I call them junk suits because they do not have any merit. The problem is they cost money to fight. Every one of these junk suits that people put out there requires the expenditure of money, which affects consumers. It affects hospitals. In order to avoid protracted litigation, those who provide insurance oftentimes just settle the case. You have got these giant judgments looming out there, people say, Well, I better just go ahead and settle this, rather than risk a bad jury verdict. That drives up costs too. People just filing these lawsuits right and left, and it is running up the costs. Doctors' premiums, the cost of doing business, they are rising. That makes it hard on the docs. It makes it hard on docs to do what they are called to do, which is to heal lives. Medical liability premiums for Arkansas doctors rose more than 150 percent last year. That makes it awfully hard for doctors to do business. Their business is seeing patients. Yet these lawsuits are making it hard for docs to practice their business in the State of Arkansas and other States as well. They get passed on to patients or their employers. One of the major cost-drivers in the delivery of health care are these junk and frivolous lawsuits. The risk of frivolous litigation drives doctors-and hear me out on this-they drive doctors to prescribe drugs and procedures that may not be necessary, just to avoid lawsuits. That is called the defensive practice of medicine. According to a survey of the Arkansas Medical Society, 90 percent of Arkansas doctors say the fear of lawsuits have caused them to do unnecessary procedures.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkslittlerockarkansas2", "title": "Remarks in Little Rock, Arkansas", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-little-rock-arkansas-2", "publication_date": "26-01-2004", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

The defensive practice of medicine affects the Federal budget. The direct cost of liability insurance and the indirect cost from unnecessary medical procedures raise the Federal Government's health care costs by at least $28 billion a year. Remember, we provide-at the Federal level, we provide health care through Medicare and Medicaid and veteran's health and Government employee costs. The defensive-the cost of defensive medicine raises your bill as a taxpayer. Not only does it make it harder to go see a doc, it also costs you more as a taxpayer. Medical liability reform is a national issue because medical liability lawsuits raise the Federal budget. It is a national issue that requires a national solution. You need to get your Governor-I know he is strongly, and the Lieutenant Governor is strongly in favor of liability reform-you need to work it here in Arkansas, by the way. It is tough, because some of these lawyer groups are some of the politically strongest groups in the State and the country. But we are doing the right thing by insisting upon medical liability reform. We are doing the right thing by telling people the truth, and that is the health care system looks like a giant lottery. That is what it looks like these days because of these lawsuits. And somehow, the trial lawyers always hold the winning ticket. Lawyers walk away with up to 40 percent- 40 percent-of every settlement and verdict, which adds up to billions of costs, billions of unnecessary costs. Lawsuits do not heal patients. And they are driving a wedge between the docs and their patients. One of the most vital links of good medicine is the doctor-patient relationship. Yet many doctors fear what they tell a patient will be used against them in a court of law. We have got a culture of lawsuit here in America, a culture of lawsuits, a litigation culture, which is driving a wedge between the doctors and patients, and that is not right. When docs treat their patients, the only thing they should worry about is the health of their patients, not some trial lawyer breathing down their neck.

In order to be a vibrant, successful community, you need a viable health care industry with good docs. And yet, 71 percent of the doctors in this State say they are considering early retirement; 50 percent of the physicians say they are having difficulty recruiting new doctors to practice in Arkansas. This litigation culture puts a sign up there saying, If you come to our State, you are likely to get sued. Who wants to do that? People want to practice medicine. They do not want to spend their time defending themselves in the courthouse because of the frivolous and junk lawsuits that are too prevalent today in America. More than a third of the docs are considering moving out of State. See, that says to me you got a problem here in Arkansas. And by the way, again I repeat, you are not alone. Trust me, you are not alone. There is a lot of States that cannot get good medical liability reform through. Today I met with some decent docs and health administrators. Let me tell you their stories so that we get a better feel for why we need medical liability reform at the State and Federal level. She is from Fayetteville, Arkansas. She practices family medicine. She was delivering between 80 and 100 babies a year. Now, there is a soul-a good soul who loves life to the point where she is willing to take her talents and deliver babies. It must be an unbelievably satisfying profession to bring life to be. And yet, in July of 2002, her insurance premiums more than doubled. See, the litigation culture made it nearly impossible for her to practice her love. I say nearly impossible, because she would not break her commitments to expecting patients and hung in there for a year. But her premiums continued to rise, and Dr. McBee has stopped delivering babies, as a direct result of too many junk lawsuits, and that is not right. Let me give you another story. John Wilson is with us. He is an orthopedist from Little Rock, Arkansas.

And for people who are not familiar with Arkansas, that is a poor, rural area that, frankly, does not have enough doctors. And he heard a calling. So he would go there to help-to love, really, if you think about it-to practice his talent and skills and to love people by helping them, and then he got sued. And the lawsuits were dropped, but he was unable to find insurance because he was told if he kept going over there, the cost of his business, the cost of being a doctor, would rise dramatically. By the way, I went to Mississippi a while ago and talked to a doc who was there in the Mississippi Delta. He came down from another State to practice medicine. He understood there is a lot of poor people there; he wanted to help them. He got sued-for helping poor people, because he is a doctor. The Wilson story and the story I just mentioned to you, it is just all too common. These junk lawsuits not only are running up the cost of medicine; they are making the quality of life of some of our citizens-diminishing the quality of life. Sully and Mary Ligon are with us. They are from Helena-or Henrietta? Anyway, see, the Ligons got help from Dr. Wilson. She was telling me she got injured during one Christmas and tore a rotator cuff, and Dr. Wilson being the good doc he is, fixed it. Her fastball is back up to about 85 miles an hour now. And Sully got knocked over by a cow. He said a wild cow, not a mad cow. It is inconvenient as heck, but they can afford to do so. There is a lot of people there that cannot , and they are missing out on a good doc. And the reason Dr. Wilson is not there is because lawsuits are running up the cost of medicine, make it hard for him to practice. I heard him.

We can have balance in our society when it comes to having a good legal system and a good medical system. D'Borai Lynn Cook-you might have heard of her if you work here. She sees firsthand what it means to practice medicine defensively. She says they over-prescribe to cover themselves to make sure that, as they do their job, they are thinking about what would happen if they end up in a court of law. She says that-she said then there is the negative aspect of defensive medicine with people saying, I am not going to handle that case. See, too many lawsuits affect the lives of a lot of good people, and we need to do something about it. And so I proposed to the Congress to act. My job as the President, if I see problems, is to address them square on, and I expect Congress to do the same thing. I expect Congress to do the same. First of all, we want to make sure the court system is uncluttered. We want to make sure that if a person is injured, they have their day in court. Frivolous and junk lawsuits make it hard for those who get injured to have their day in court, for starters. And secondly, obviously, if they have been hurt by a bad doc, there needs to be a judgment, and that person needs to be able to recover the cost of their care, the recovery, and the economic losses for the rest of their life. Good docs are not afraid to stand up in a court of law. They just do not want to be run out of business because of these junk lawsuits, just filing suit after suit after suit. People ought to be allowed to recover economic damages. But for the sake of a strong health care system, for the sake of making sure health care is accessible and affordable, we need a $250,000 cap on non-economic damages. States that have got a hard cap have seen positive results, have seen the judicial system work well and the medical field stay vibrant.

And your Senators need to hear from you about a balanced, fair system. For the sake of Arkansas and States around the country, you need medical liability reform. We need to make sure we have got joint and several liability reform as well. See, what happens is some of these junk lawsuits, they will just file against everybody. Even though they may not be like 100-percent responsible for an issue, they will have to pay 100 percent of the cost. That hurts hospitals in particular and a lot of docs as well.

Let me talk about one other issue, and then I will let you get back to work. Today I met Mary Lynn Roberson at the airport. I told her I was going to say her name. She has volunteered here for nearly three decades. She visits with family and friends of surgery patients. In other words, she is spreading love, is what she is doing. And the reason I bring that up, and her work, is because the true strength of America is the fact that there are Mary Lynns in every community who are willing to take time out of their personal life to love a neighbor just like you'd like to be loved yourself. We are a mighty nation when it comes to our military, and we will keep it that way. We are a mighty nation when it comes to wealth in our economy, and it is getting better. But the most mighty aspect of our Nation is the fact that our citizens, from all walks of life, care deeply about a neighbor in need.

We have come here our first stop this morning on this Decoration Day was at Arlington Cemetery and I just wonder if because of the special character of this day, Memorial Day, if we could not perhaps bow our heads for a few seconds in silent prayer for those who have given their lives that we might live in liberty. Well, indeed it is an honor for me to be here today to receive a magnificent gift that I received on a second and very much warmer Inauguration Day. I understand that in preparing for this event more than 2,500 young people worked with sponsors in the private sector who donated food, transportation, and lodging. And each of you who helped to make this private sector initiative possible has my heartfelt thanks. Tomorrow evening I will address the Nation about a dramatic proposal to reform our tax system. It is a proposal intended to launch a new American revolution and to give to you young people, as you come of age, a nation of ever-greater freedom and vitality and strength. You know, today we are enjoying a standard of living that, when I was your age, could not even have been imagined. Buoyed by medical breakthroughs and rising standards of living, the life expectancy of Americans has been increasing steadily for 50 years. I have already surpassed my own life expectancy at my birth by 20 years. Now, there are a lot of people that find that a source of annoyance, but I appreciate it very much. Today we take for granted so many inventions that inspired wonder not long ago the polio vaccines of Dr. Jonas Salk and Dr. Albert Sabin; television, first in black and white and now in vivid color; drought-resistant seeds and cold-resistant grains; computers in the workplace and the home; spacecraft that can orbit the Earth for days and then land gently on a desert runway. Despite the predictions so many made during the Great Depression when I was a young man, life in America today is not worse it is far better. Was it government directing our daily lives? During these past five decades the Government has indeed provided vital services and helped improve life for many people. No one doubts the necessity of a strong national defense or the role our military has played in keeping us free.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksparticipantsthepresidentsinauguralbandsparadewaltdisneysepcotcenternear", "title": "Remarks to Participants in the President's Inaugural Bands Parade at Walt Disney's EPCOT Center Near Orlando, Florida", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-participants-the-presidents-inaugural-bands-parade-walt-disneys-epcot-center-near", "publication_date": "27-05-1985", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 6034, "text": "Likewise no one doubts the importance of the government safety net for those in genuine need. Yet our national experience shows that when government grows beyond these two limited duties, when government lays claim to more and more of our resources and begins, through massive regulation and high taxation, to impinge on our individual freedoms, then our economy grows not more prosperous but less so. Throughout the 1970's, for example, government's growth was unbridled, yet our economy stagnated. By 1980 the gross national product registered zero growth. If it was not the Government that spurred our economic growth was it perhaps our natural resources? Our vast land has always been blessed by a mighty multitude of resources broad plains, powerful rivers, and rich deposits of minerals. Yet in a sense, the primary reality of a resource exists not in the earth but in the minds of the men and women who give it usefulness and value. A century ago oil was nothing but a thick, foul, and useless liquid. It was the invention of the internal combustion engine that gave oil its function. Or think of sand, sand that used to be nothing but the stuff that deserts are made of. The development of the silicon microchip has given sand a vital function. And today we use it to make chips that give home computers their intelligence, monitor functions on aircraft, and guide our satellites through the dark reaches of space. No, it is not been so much our resources or our government that have given us our enduring vibrancy and growth but the initiative and enterprise of individual Americans. Air travel, for example, has become commonplace because test pilots like Lindbergh had daring, and engineers like Boeing and Douglas had the wits and determination. The Government might have wished it could simply decree a polio vaccine, but it took years of unremitting effort and dedication by Doctors Salk and Sabin to make the vaccines a reality. In this setting, one story of a private initiative is particularly appropriate. Back in Missouri in the early 1900's there lived a farmboy who discovered that he had a knack for drawing barnyard animals. As an adult, he began to put his animals into cartoons, and he became convinced that he could entertain people by telling stories about a little creature with a high voice, red trousers, and yellow shoes and white gloves. Professionals in the field made fun of the idea, and to produce his first cartoons the young man had to sell or pawn virtually everything he owned.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksparticipantsthepresidentsinauguralbandsparadewaltdisneysepcotcenternear", "title": "Remarks to Participants in the President's Inaugural Bands Parade at Walt Disney's EPCOT Center Near Orlando, Florida", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-participants-the-presidents-inaugural-bands-parade-walt-disneys-epcot-center-near", "publication_date": "27-05-1985", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

The determination that each of these heroes of progress demonstrated came from within. Yet in each case it was crucial to the success of their efforts that they were operating in a climate of economic liberty in a free market where they could make use of pooled resources, experiment with new techniques and products, and submit their plans and hypotheses to the test of practical experience. This aspect of freedom, economic freedom, is one of the distinctive characteristics of life in our nation, as interwoven into the American legacy as freedom of speech and press. It has enabled our people to make our nation into a marvel of economic progress, and, as with all the freedoms that we enjoy, it is our duty to cherish and protect it. Just as the American people rebelled against oppressive taxation some two centuries ago, the reform that I will announce tomorrow will represent a dramatic effort to make our tax code more simple, efficient, and fair and place more resources into the hands of your families and, ultimately, you yourselves. It will expand our economic freedom and clear the way for even greater economic vitality than that which we enjoy today. With more resources at their disposal, the American people will be able to provide greater support to the institutions that they themselves value our schools, universities, the arts, our churches and synagogues. John Marshall said, The power to tax involves the power to destroy. If so, then the power to cut taxes must surely be the power to create the power to force government to stand back and let the people themselves give expression to the spirit of enterprise building and imagining; giving to you, our sons and daughters, a nation of ever-greater prosperity and freedom. May you enjoy all the blessings of a free and bountiful nation, and on this, the eve of the second American revolution, may you always remember the enduring truth that our tax plan seeks to embody and that Americans have cherished through the ages God made man for liberty.

I have often expressed my feeling that the mere fact that I am President should not disqualify me from expressing as a citizen my views on candidates and issues in my own State. I have changed my mind about the nature of some problems of democratic government over the past few years as I have had more and more experience with them. I had never realized how much my way of thinking had changed until the other day when I was watching the finishing touches being put on a simple cottage I have recently built-a little cottage which, by the way, is not in any sense of the word a dream house. Just watching the building go up made me realize that there was a time not so long ago when I used to think about problems of government as if they were the same kind of problems as building a house-definite and compact and capable of completion within a given time. Once you build a house you always have it. On the other hand, a social or an economic gain is a different matter. A social or an economic gain made by one Administration, for instance, may, and often does, evaporate into thin air under the next Administration. We all remember well known examples of what an ill-advised shift from liberal to conservative leadership can do to an incompleted liberal program. Theodore Roosevelt, for example, started a march of progress during his seven years in the Presidency but, after four years of President Taft, little was left of the progress that had been made. Think of the great liberal achievements of Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom and how quickly they were liquidated under President Harding. We have to have reasonable continuity in liberal government in order to get permanent results. The whole United States concedes that we in the State of New York have carried out a magnificent liberal program through our State government during the past sixteen years. If the continuity of that liberal government had been broken in this State during that time, we would be nowhere near the point we have reached today. The voters throughout the country should remember that need for continuous liberal government when they vote next Tuesday.

No one next Tuesday will order us how to vote, and the only watchers we shall find at the polls are the watchers who guarantee that our ballot is secret. But we cannot carelessly assume that a nation is strong and great merely because it has a democratic form of government. We have learned that a democracy weakened by internal dissension, by mutual suspicion born of social injustice, is no match for autocracies which are ruthless enough to repress internal dissension. Democracy in order to live must become a positive force in the daily lives of its people. It must make men and women whose devotion it seeks, feel that it really cares for the security of every individual; that it is tolerant enough to inspire an essential unity among its citizens; and that it is militant enough to maintain liberty against social oppression at home and against military aggression abroad. The rest of the world is far closer to us in every way than in the days of democracy's founders-Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln. Comparisons in this world are unavoidable. To disprove the pretenses of rival systems, democracy must be an affirmative, up-to-date conception. It can no longer be negative-no longer adopt a defeatist attitude. In these tense and dangerous situations in the world, democracy will save itself with the average man and woman by proving itself worth saving. Too many of those who prate about saving democracy are really only interested in saving things as they were. Democracy should concern itself also with things as they ought to be. I am not talking mere idealism; I am expressing realistic necessity. I reject the merely negative purposes proposed by old-line Republicans and Communists alike-for they are people whose only purpose is to survive against any other Fascist threat than their own. As of today, Fascism and Communism-and old-line Tory Republicanism-are not threats to the continuation of our form of government. But I venture the challenging statement that if American democracy ceases to move forward as a living force, seeking day and night by peaceful means to better the lot of our citizens, then Fascism and Communism, aided, unconsciously perhaps, by old-line Tory Republicanism, will grow in strength in our land.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddresstheelectionliberals", "title": "Radio Address on the Election of Liberals", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-election-liberals", "publication_date": "04-11-1938", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

And only a nation completely convinced-at the bottom as well as at the top-that their system of government best serves their best interests, will have such a cool judgment. And while we are developing that coolness of judgment, we need in public office, above all things, men wise enough to avoid passing incidents where passion and force try to substitute themselves for judgment and negotiation. During my four years as Governor of the State of New York and during my nearly six years as President, I am proud of the fact that I have never called out the armed forces of the State or Nation except on errands of mercy. That type of democratic wisdom was illustrated last year by the action of Governor Murphy of Michigan when he persuaded the negotiators of the employers and employees to sit around a table. Thus he got an agreement, avoided bloodshed, and earned the praise of both sides of a controversy that had frightened a whole nation. With such an approach, the New Deal, keeping its feet on the ground, is working out hundreds of current problems from day to day as necessities arise and with whatever materials are at hand. We are doing this without attempting to commit the Nation to any ism or any ideology except democracy, humanity and the civil liberties which form their foundations. Our economic and social system cannot deny the paramount right of the millions who toil and the millions who wish to toil, to have it function smoothly and efficiently. After all, any such system must provide efficiently for distributing national resources and serving the welfare and happiness of all who live under it. The modern interdependent industrial and agricultural society which we live in is like a large factory. Each member of the organization has his own job to perform on the assembly line, but if the conveyor belt breaks or gets tangled up, no one in the factory, no matter how hard he tries, can do his own particular job. Each of us-farmer, business man or worker-suffers when anything goes wrong with the conveyor belt. If our democracy is to survive it must give the average man reasonable assurance that the belt will be kept moving. Dictators have recognized that problem. They keep the conveyor belt moving-but at a terrible price to the individual and to his civil liberty. The New Deal has been trying to keep those belts moving without paying such a price.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddresstheelectionliberals", "title": "Radio Address on the Election of Liberals", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-address-the-election-liberals", "publication_date": "04-11-1938", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

That should be left to individuals, to corporations, to any other form of private management, with profit for those who manage well. But when an abuse interferes with the ability of private enterprise to keep the national conveyor belt moving, government has a responsibility to eliminate that abuse. We do not assume for a minute that all we have done is right or all that we have done has been successful, but our economic and social program of the past five and a half years has definitely given to the United States of America a more stable and less artificial prosperity than any other nation in the world has enjoyed in that period. The very fact that the business slump that began last fall and kept running into last summer did not become a major economic disaster, like the terrible slump that ran from 1929 all the way through to 1933, is the best kind of proof that fundamentally we have found the right track. You have just heard the news about the automobile factories and many other industries that are opening up for full employment again. And during the month of October alone over-all employment has risen nearly 3 1/2 per cent. I have been very happy in the last six months to see how swiftly a large majority of businessmen have been coming around to accept the objectives of a more stable economy and of certain necessary supervision of private activities in order to prevent a return of the serious abuses and conditions of the past. But if there should be any weakening of the power of a liberal government next Tuesday, it would resurrect false hopes on the part of some businessmen who are now beginning to change antiquated ideas, hopes that if they can hold out just a little longer no adaptation to change will be necessary. And because these basic desires are well known you find all parties, all candidates, making the same general promises to satisfy these desires. During the weeks before a general election, all parties are the friends of labor, all parties are against monopoly, all parties say that the unemployed must have work or be given government relief, and all parties love the farmer. Of course we believe all these things; we believe in social security; we believe in work for the unemployed; we believe in saving homes.

They try to stop the only fire engine we have from rushing to the fire because they are sales agents for a different make of fire engine. New ideas cannot be administered successfully by men with old ideas, for the first essential of doing a job well is the wish to see the job done at all.

In 1918, twenty years ago, when I was thirty-six years old, I was invited to run for the Governorship of this State. I was then Assistant Secretary of the Navy. I declined the offer, because my job required me at that time to sail on a destroyer for overseas service. I am glad I did, for, looking back on that time, I do not think that I had experience and knowledge of public affairs wide enough to qualify as Governor. Besides, I did not think it quite right to abandon in mid-stream an important public job that I had undertaken. The Governor of this State is called upon to administer eighteen great departments of government and to supervise state institutions that house over one hundred thousand wards of the State.

Equal protection of the law- criminal and civil- for human rights as well as property rights; prosecution of criminals in high financial places as well as in low places; the preservation of civil and religious liberties-all these precious essentials of civilization are entrusted to him.

Recruits in the battle for economic democracy are always welcome irrespective of party; but at a critical moment in the world's history we cannot take the risk of supplanting seasoned leaders like Governor Lehman with men, no matter how sincere, who have yet to win their spurs or prove what they really know or where they really stand in the fight for social justice. Those who truly and sincerely join the struggle for social justice, economic democracy for its own sake, do not throw stones at veteran fighters in that cause. No one can properly minimize the need of active law enforcement, whether it be in-a great city or in the rural counties of this or any other state. Certainly Governor Lehman has never minimized it, and has never hesitated to call to his assistance in law enforcement, young and vigorous prosecutors, irrespective of politics. We need more active law enforcement, not only against the lords of the underworld, but also against the lords of the over world. It is right-wholly right-to prosecute criminals.

A Senator from New York must do more than merely vote on whatever bills happen to drift by.

If you were to list some of the newly recognized major responsibilities of government to meet the complexities of modern. life-security in old age, unemployment insurance, protection of the rights of labor, low-cost housing, and slum clearance you would have a virtual resume of the Acts of the Congress that bear the name of Robert F. Wagner. So often since 1933 has new legislation been described as The Wagner Act that the phrase has become confusing because there have been so many Wagner Acts. For example, there is not only the Wagner Labor Relations Act; there are the Wagner Social Security Act and the Wagner Housing Act; and although you might feel uncertain as to which particular Act is meant by the phrase, you can feel no uncertainty as to this-that any one of the Wagner Acts was an Act intended for the benefit of those who need the help and support of government against oppression and against intolerable conditions of living. His name stands in our history for courageous and intelligent leadership, constructive statecraft and steadfast devotion to the common man and the cause of civil liberties. With him I hope the voters of this State will send to the Senate in Washington an experienced Member of the House of Representatives-James M. Mead-known through many years for his expert knowledge of three fields whose intricate problems press heavily upon government today-railroads, aviation and Civil Service, and for his unflagging support of every liberal measure that has come before the Congress.

And I want to congratulate all the Presidential Certificate Award winners for their dedication to the career development of America's youth and for their generous support of the 1983 private sector jobs program. It is times like this that remind us America was built by people helping people. We are proud to honor you this morning. Would not it be great if we had to hold this out on the South Lawn could not get it in the Rose Garden anymore. Many of you will recall that last July we held a similar ceremony right here in the Rose Garden. And since then, more than 3 million Americans have found jobs. In fact, since the economic expansion began 17 months ago, 5.4 million Americans have found jobs, and the unemployment rate has shown the sharpest drop or the steepest drop in 30 years. Now, that is why when I am asked to describe our economic program I do it with three words jobs, jobs, jobs. But we cannot rest until everyone who wants one and needs one has one. We must and will go forward to keep opportunities expanding, particularly for the young people of America. No single sector of our nation-government, business, labor, or nonprofit organization-can solve the unemployment problem, the needs of our young people. But by working together, pooling our resources and building on our strengths, we can accomplish great things. That is the whole idea behind our youth employment programs' public-private partnerships-to produce real, not make-work, jobs. Partnerships take advantage of opportunities to help America's youth gain a foothold on the economic ladder. Young people who want to work in the summer deserve the chance, and partnerships can make it happen. The summer youth employment program includes a $725 million block grant to State and local governments. This grant will give 718,000 young Americans valuable work experience, but it is only part of our effort to help deserving young people get a start. Another program in place gives employers who hire economically disadvantaged teenagers a tax credit of up to 85 percent of the wages paid. The employers get a young employee the company may not be able to afford without the tax break, and the young worker gets a needed job and valuable work experience in the private sector. Austin Cunningham of Orangeburg, South Carolina, who is with us today, can tell you how well the targeted jobs tax credit program works.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkswhitehouseceremonymarkingthebeginningthesummeryouthemploymentprogram", "title": "Remarks at a White House Ceremony Marking the Beginning of the Summer Youth Employment Program", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-white-house-ceremony-marking-the-beginning-the-summer-youth-employment-program", "publication_date": "17-05-1984", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Together, they hired 264 economically disadvantaged young people. For most of these 16- and 17- year-olds it was their first real job. And when the summer was over, many of them were asked to stay on full-time even though the tax credit no longer applied. Now, that is partnership in action, and everybody's better off because of it. What we are trying to do is help our young people find that critical first job. With experience in the workplace, America's youth can develop skills and demonstrate their qualifications and potential-permanent employers. But far too often, inexperienced and disadvantaged young people are priced out of the labor market by the minimum wage. Well, Ray Donovan and a lot of other people here today have put together legislation that will give a much-needed boost to those looking for that first job. Today I will submit our youth employment opportunity wage act to the Congress. And Senators Percy and Hatch and Congressman Packard, who have worked hard on this bill, will introduce it on the Hill in behalf of the administration and the American people. This legislation would allow employers to hire young people at a lower minimum wage during the summer months. The bill would increase summer employment opportunities and provide explicit safeguards to protect permanent employees and sanctions to prevent abuse. Now, I am delighted that the National Conference of Black Mayors has endorsed the concept of the youth employment opportunity wage. And now that Mayor Johnny Ford, the past president, and Mayor Marion Barry, the current president of the National Conference of Black Mayors, have endorsed this legislation, maybe we can help Chuck, Orrin, and Ron get this important jobs initiative approved by the Congress. While I have the chance, I want to thank Bill Kolberg and all the other executives of the National Alliance of Business for their continuing support in coordinating the summer jobs program. The White House Office of Private Sector Initiatives and the NAB have done an outstanding job in leading this year's effort.

I have always heard about the splendor of your country and the kindness of your citizens, but words do not do justice to the grandeur of this remarkable place and the incredible hospitality you have shown us from the moment we arrived. You also hosted me in the treasured home of King Abdulaziz, the founder of the Kingdom who united your great people. Working alongside another beloved leader - American President Franklin Roosevelt - King Abdulaziz began the enduring partnership between our two countries. your father would be so proud to see that you are continuing his legacy - and just as he opened the first chapter in our partnership, today we begin a new chapter that will bring lasting benefits to our citizens. Let me now also extend my deep and heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of the distinguished heads of state who made this journey here today. You greatly honor us with your presence, and I send the warmest regards from my country to yours. I know that our time together will bring many blessings to both your people and mine. I stand before you as a representative of the American People, to deliver a message of friendship and hope. That is why I chose to make my first foreign visit a trip to the heart of the Muslim world, to the nation that serves as custodian of the two holiest sites in the Islamic Faith. In my inaugural address to the American People, I pledged to strengthen America's oldest friendships, and to build new partnerships in pursuit of peace. I also promised that America will not seek to impose our way of life on others, but to outstretch our hands in the spirit of cooperation and trust. Our vision is one of peace, security, and prosperity-in this region, and in the world. Our goal is a coalition of nations who share the aim of stamping out extremism and providing our children a hopeful future that does honor to God. And so this historic and unprecedented gathering of leaders-unique in the history of nations-is a symbol to the world of our shared resolve and our mutual respect. To the leaders and citizens of every country assembled here today, I want you to know that the United States is eager to form closer bonds of friendship, security, culture and commerce.

Now, there is even more blessed news I am pleased to share with you. My meetings with King Salman, the Crown Prince, and the Deputy Crown Prince, have been filled with great warmth, good will, and tremendous cooperation. Yesterday, we signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia. This landmark agreement includes the announcement of a $110 billion Saudi-funded defense purchase - and we will be sure to help our Saudi friends to get a good deal from our great American defense companies. This agreement will help the Saudi military to take a greater role in security operations. We have also started discussions with many of the countries present today on strengthening partnerships, and forming new ones, to advance security and stability across the Middle East and beyond. Later today, we will make history again with the opening of a new Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology - located right here, in this central part of the Islamic World. This groundbreaking new center represents a clear declaration that Muslim-majority countries must take the lead in combatting radicalization, and I want to express our gratitude to King Salman for this strong demonstration of leadership. I have had the pleasure of welcoming several of the leaders present today to the White House, and I look forward to working with all of you. America is a sovereign nation and our first priority is always the safety and security of our citizens. We are not here to lecture-we are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership - based on shared interests and values - to pursue a better future for us all. Here at this summit we will discuss many interests we share together. But above all we must be united in pursuing the one goal that transcends every other consideration. That goal is to meet history's great test-to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces of terrorism.

God's help, this summit will mark the beginning of the end for those who practice terror and spread its vile creed. At the same time, we pray this special gathering may someday be remembered as the beginning of peace in the Middle East - and maybe, even all over the world. But this future can only be achieved through defeating terrorism and the ideology that drives it. Few nations have been spared its violent reach. America has suffered repeated barbaric attacks - from the atrocities of September 11th to the devastation of the Boston Bombing, to the horrible killings in San Bernardino and Orlando. The nations of Europe have also endured unspeakable horror. So too have the nations of Africa and even South America. But, in sheer numbers, the deadliest toll has been exacted on the innocent people of Arab, Muslim and Middle Eastern nations. They have borne the brunt of the killings and the worst of the destruction in this wave of fanatical violence. Some estimates hold that more than 95 percent of the victims of terrorism are themselves Muslim. We now face a humanitarian and security disaster in this region that is spreading across the planet. It is a tragedy of epic proportions. No description of the suffering and depravity can begin to capture its full measure. The true toll of ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas, and so many others, must be counted not only in the number of dead. It must also be counted in generations of vanished dreams. The Middle East is rich with natural beauty, vibrant cultures, and massive amounts of historic treasures. It should increasingly become one of the great global centers of commerce and opportunity. This region should not be a place from which refugees flee, but to which newcomers flock. Saudi Arabia is home to the holiest sites in one of the world's great faiths. Each year millions of Muslims come from around the world to Saudi Arabia to take part in the Hajj. In addition to ancient wonders, this country is also home to modern ones-including soaring achievements in architecture. Egypt was a thriving center of learning and achievement thousands of years before other parts of the world. The wonders of Giza, Luxor and Alexandria are proud monuments to that ancient heritage.

The potential of this region has never been greater. 65 percent of its population is under the age of 30. Like all young men and women, they seek great futures to build, great national projects to join, and a place for their families to call home. But this untapped potential, this tremendous cause for optimism, is held at bay by bloodshed and terror. Every time a terrorist murders an innocent person, and falsely invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith. Terrorists do not worship God, they worship death. If we do not act against this organized terror, then we know what will happen. Terrorism's devastation of life will continue to spread. Peaceful societies will become engulfed by violence. And the futures of many generations will be sadly squandered. If we do not stand in uniform condemnation of this killing-then not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, but we will be judged by God. This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations. This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between Good and Evil. When we see the scenes of destruction in the wake of terror, we see no signs that those murdered were Jewish or Christian, Shia or Sunni. When we look upon the streams of innocent blood soaked into the ancient ground, we cannot see the faith or sect or tribe of the victims - we see only that they were Children of God whose deaths are an insult to all that is holy. But we can only overcome this evil if the forces of good are united and strong - and if everyone in this room does their fair share and fulfills their part of the burden. Terrorism has spread across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land.

For our part, America is committed to adjusting our strategies to meet evolving threats and new facts. We will discard those strategies that have not worked-and will apply new approaches informed by experience and judgment. We are adopting a Principled Realism, rooted in common values and shared interests. Our friends will never question our support, and our enemies will never doubt our determination. Our partnerships will advance security through stability, not through radical disruption. We will make decisions based on real-world outcomes - not inflexible ideology. We will be guided by the lessons of experience, not the confines of rigid thinking. And, wherever possible, we will seek gradual reforms - not sudden intervention. We must seek partners, not perfection-and to make allies of all who share our goals. Above all, America seeks peace - not war. Muslim nations must be willing to take on the burden, if we are going to defeat terrorism and send its wicked ideology into oblivion. The first task in this joint effort is for your nations to deny all territory to the foot soldiers of evil. Every country in the region has an absolute duty to ensure that terrorists find no sanctuary on their soil. Jordanian pilots are crucial partners against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia and a regional coalition have taken strong action against Houthi militants in Yemen. The Lebanese ENTITY is hunting ISIS operatives who try to infiltrate their territory. Emirati troops are supporting our Afghan partners. In Mosul, American troops are supporting Kurds, Sunnis and Shias fighting together for their homeland. Qatar, which hosts the U.S. Central Command, is a crucial strategic partner. Our longstanding partnership with Kuwait and Bahrain continue to enhance security in the region. And courageous Afghan soldiers are making tremendous sacrifices in the fight against the Taliban, and others, in the fight for their country. As we deny terrorist organizations control of territory and populations, we must also strip them of their access to funds.

It is another historic step in a day that will be long remembered. I also applaud the Gulf Cooperation Council for blocking funders from using their countries as a financial base for terror, and designating Hezbollah as a terrorist organization last year. Saudi Arabia also joined us this week in placing sanctions on one of the most senior leaders of Hezbollah. That means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamist extremism and the Islamist terror groups it inspires. And it means standing together against the murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the persecution of Jews, and the slaughter of Christians. Barbarism will deliver you no glory - piety to evil will bring you no dignity. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and YOUR SOUL WILL BE CONDEMNED. heroes do not kill innocents; they save them. Many nations here today have taken important steps to raise up that message. Saudi Arabia's Vision for 2030 is an important and encouraging statement of tolerance, respect, empowering women, and economic development. The United Arab Emirates has also engaged in the battle for hearts and souls-and with the U.S., launched a center to counter the online spread of hate. Bahrain too is working to undermine recruitment and radicalism. I also applaud Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees. The surge of migrants and refugees leaving the Middle East depletes the human capital needed to build stable societies and economies. Instead of depriving this region of so much human potential, Middle Eastern countries can give young people hope for a brighter future in their home nations and regions. That means promoting the aspirations and dreams of all citizens who seek a better life - including women, children, and followers of all faiths. Numerous Arab and Islamic scholars have eloquently argued that protecting equality strengthens Arab and Muslim communities. For many centuries the Middle East has been home to Christians, Muslims and Jews living side-by-side.

I will be meeting with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Starving terrorists of their territory, their funding, and the false allure of their craven ideology, will be the basis for defeating them. But no discussion of stamping out this threat would be complete without mentioning the government that gives terrorists all three-safe harbor, financial backing, and the social standing needed for recruitment. It is a regime that is responsible for so much instability in the region. I am speaking of course of Iran. From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms, and trains terrorists, militias, and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region. For decades, Iran has fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror. It is a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room. Bolstered by Iran, Assad has committed unspeakable crimes, and the United States has taken firm action in response to the use of banned chemical weapons by the Assad Regime - launching 59 tomahawk missiles at the Syrian air base from where that murderous attack originated. Responsible nations must work together to end the humanitarian crisis in Syria, eradicate ISIS, and restore stability to the region. Iran has a rich history and culture, but the people of Iran have endured hardship and despair under their leaders' reckless pursuit of conflict and terror. Until the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism, and pray for the day when the Iranian people have the just and righteous government they deserve.

But what I said then at Grant Park was that this was not the end of the road, it was just the beginning.

We knew it was not going to be easy to end two wars and restore America's leadership around the world. We knew it was not going to be easy to fix our immigration system, to reform our health care system, to transform our energy policy, to educate our young people for the demands of a global economy.

We had to prevent a financial system from falling apart and dragging the economy into depression. We had to pass reforms to stop abuses in the financial system and prevent future crises. We had to rescue the auto industry. Even though there were a lot of people who said, let them go, let more than a million jobs vanish, allow two of America's iconic companies to be liquidated and sold off for parts, we said, no, we are going to have to step up, we are going to have to deal with it.

That is why you supported me, because we believed in an economy that did not just work for those at the top, but worked for everybody, where prosperity was shared from the machinist on the line to the manager on the floor to the CEO in the boardroom.

We removed a hundred thousand troops from Iraq already, ended combat missions there. We are on track to bring the rest of our troops home by the end of this year. I ran for President because I believed we needed to refocus our efforts in Afghanistan, and we are doing this too. We pummeled Al Qaida. We took out bin Laden.

It is why we launched the first comprehensive national ENTITY/ENTITY strategy, providing a roadmap not only to providing treatment and reducing infections, but also embracing the potential of new, groundbreaking research that will help us bring an end to this pandemic. That is why I ordered Federal agencies to extend the same benefits to gay couples that go to straight couples wherever possible. That is why we are going to keep on fighting until the law no longer treats committed partners who have been together for decades like they are strangers. That is why I have long believed that the so-called Defense of Marriage Act ought to be repealed. And since I taught constitutional law for a while, I felt like I was in a pretty good position to agree with courts that have ruled that section 3 of DOMA violates the Constitution. And that is why we decided, with my Attorney General, that we could no longer defend the constitutionality of DOMA in the courts. Now, part of the reason that DOMA does not make sense is that, traditionally, marriage has been decided by the States. And right now I understand there is a little debate going on here in New York----about whether to join five other States and DC in allowing civil marriage for gay couples. And I want to say that under the leadership of Governor Cuomo, with the support of Democrats and Republicans, New York is doing exactly what democracies are supposed to do. There is a debate; there is deliberation about what it means here in New York to treat people fairly in the eyes of the law. And that is--look, that is the power of our democratic system.

So we are no longer going to demand brave and patriotic Americans live a lie to serve their country. Folks like Captain Jonathan Hopkins, who led a platoon into northern Iraq during the initial invasion and quelled an ethnic riot and earned a Bronze Star with valor. He was discharged, only to receive e-mails and letters from his soldiers saying, if they had known he was gay all along--that they had known he was gay all along and they still thought he was the best commander they had ever had. That is how progress is being won here in New York, around the country. Day by day, it is won by ordinary people who are striving and fighting and protesting for change and who, yes, are keeping the pressure up, including pressure on me. raising their families, doing their jobs, joining the PTA, singing in church, serving and sacrificing for this country overseas, even as they are not always granted the full rights of citizenship they deserve here at home. Last year, I received a letter from a teenager growing up in a small town, and he told me he was a senior in high school, and that he was proud to be the captain of a club at his school, and that he was gay. And he had not told his parents. He did not think it was safe to, in his words, openly be myself. But this 17-year-old also looked towards the day when he did not have to be afraid, when he did not have to worry about walking down the hallway. Everyone else is considered equal in this country. So yes, we have more work to do. Yes, we have more progress to make. Yes, I expect continued impatience with me on occasion.

Our Nation's transportation infrastructure is vital to our prosperity and competitiveness; it is critical to the everyday lives of our citizens.

In addition, the Secretary of Transportation plays an important role in our Nation's coordinated efforts to guard against terrorist threats to our aircraft, our seaports, and our infrastructure. It is the job that requires vision and strong leadership. Mary Peters is the right person for this job. She brings a lifetime of experience on transportation issues, from both the private and public sectors. She now serves as a senior executive for transportation policy at a major engineering firm. Before that, Mary served in my administration as the head of the Federal Highway Administration. As Administrator, Mary led efforts to improve safety and security, reduce traffic congestion, and modernize America's roads and bridges. And before coming to Washington, Mary served in the Arizona Department of Transportation for more than 15 years, rising through the ranks to become the director in 1998. Mary has a reputation for character and common sense. She knows how to set priorities and to solve problems. And as a member of my Cabinet, Mary will work closely with State and local leaders to ensure that America has a state-of-the-art transportation system that meets the needs of our growing economy. When confirmed by the Senate, Mary will succeed one of our Nation's finest Secretaries of Transportation in Norm Mineta. When I came to Washington, I asked Norm to continue his service by joining my Cabinet. And he shows that when we put politics aside, people from different political parties can work together to achieve results for the American people. He was the Secretary of Transportation on September the 11th, 2001, and he led the unprecedented effort to bring tens of thousands of passengers aboard commercial aircraft to safe landings. And since then, he is worked to strengthen the security at America's airports and seaports. He is played a critical role in keeping America safe from terrorist attacks. Norm also worked hard to modernize the aviation market. And after Hurricane Katrina, Norm and his team swung into action to repair and reopen major highways and seaports and airports and pipelines along America's gulf coast. Norm Mineta has served America with integrity and dedication and distinction.

Hardly one among them has not received men and treasure, brawn and brains, from New England's inexhaustible reserves. The average American as I have met him on these voyages is no longer indifferent to the problems of Government. And it is my opinion that there is more downright political intelligence than ever before in our entire history. In a world which in many places has gone undemocratic, we have gone more democratic. It is a bad sign for those who believe that the American people can be swept off their feet by rabble-rousers this year. The American mind today is above the rabble level. Two weeks from today, the day after election, the American air will be cleaner and American democracy will be safer. I want to speak to you briefly and simply about the prosperity of all the Nation, for in that prosperity all New England has an immediate and a direct interest. The golden State House dome symbolizes in itself the preservation of the political unity of the Nation. But New England is heir to the lasting fruits of another great New England tradition-the tradition of being a part in the economic development of the entire Union, and of sharing in all of its prosperity. In the most immediate sense, the problems of the great population of the West and South are your problems too. The sale of New England's shoes depends in part on the price of Kansas' wheat and Georgia's cotton. Prosperity for the California fruit grower depends in part on the prosperity of the New England textile mill. New England savings have prospered in developing Western mines and railroads and stockyards and farms. I have thought much of this interdependence as I have traveled through the great Western country. And I am confident that level-headed New England knows how true that is, knows it in spite of a cantankerous minority that in every difficult time has found spokesmen to try to persuade New England that its interest is not the interest of the rest of the Union. They tell New England today as they have told it before that it has been ruined by Government policies designed to benefit only the rest of the Union. We all know that New England has had its troubles. We all know that New England is coming out of its troubles.

Does that look to you like the end of private enterprise? For many years under Republican Administrations, New England was handicapped. Every realistic business man of New England knows. That New England had established standards of wages and of living which put some of its industries at a competitive disadvantage with sections of the country which had not reached those standards. That those lower standards were exploited by an absentee landlordism which exported from New England too much of its capital-capital that was used elsewhere to compete with industries at home. Concentrated wealth and economic power gobbled up or wiped out or moved away hundreds of small independent New England businesses-the kinds of businesses with which at one time New England had conquered the markets of the world. What did Republican leadership do to meet those difficulties? A high protective tariff alone could not help New England meet the unfair competition from domestic competitors on the one hand, and the unfair competition of monopoly on the other. To make matters worse, that tariff shut off the foreign commerce on which the sea coast population and industrial population of New England had lived. The full fruit of these Republican policies of twelve years is found in the record of what happened to New England's industries under those policies. New England was engulfed by the depression five years before the rest of the country. That is New England's debt to the Republican leadership of the boom era. What has this Administration done? We have raised wages and living standards in other sections of the country. They are being brought up toward the standards of New England. That kind of unfair competition is being destroyed. Most of us are in favor of that. We have begun the first real offensive in our history against that concentrated wealth and monopolistic power which almost destroyed the small businesses and diversified industries of New England. Most of us are in favor of that. By reciprocal trade agreements, we have begun to reopen foreign markets for New England products and New England shipping and trade. Most of us are in favor of that. We have increased the purchasing power of New England's customers out on the farms and in the cities of the Nation. And most of us are in favor of that.

I am even more passionate about it today. Because while our economy has been growing for 4 years and those at the top are doing better than ever, average wages have barely budged. We have got to reverse those trends. We have got to build an economy that works for everyone, not just a fortunate few. And the opportunity agenda I laid out last week will help us do that. It is an agenda with four parts. And number four, making sure that hard work pays off, with wages you can live on, savings you can retire on, and health insurance that is there when you need it. I want to work with Congress on this agenda wherever I can. But in this year of action, whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, I will. a pen to take executive action and a phone to rally citizens and business leaders who are eager to create new jobs and new opportunities. In Wisconsin, I ordered an across-the-board reform of our training programs to train folks with the skills employers need and then match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now. In Pittsburgh, I directed the Treasury to create MyRA, a new way for working Americans even if you are not wealthy to start your own retirement savings. In Maryland, I rallied the leaders of some of America's biggest tech companies to help us make sure all our kids have access to high-speed Internet and up-to-date technology to help them learn the skills they need for the new economy. And at the White House, I brought together business leaders who have committed to helping more unemployed Americans find work, no matter how long they have been looking. based on whether applicants can do the job, not when they last had a job. So when you hear me talking about using my pen and my phone to make a difference for middle class Americans and those working to get into the middle class, that is what I mean.

But I thank you all very much, and it is always a pleasure to welcome the business men and women of America to the White House. I am delighted to take part in celebrating World Trade Week, which reaffirms the importance to our well-being of trade and recognizes the need for increased export efforts. America's future growth and prosperity depend on how well we develop and compete in foreign markets. One in eight manufacturing jobs is related to exports, and 25 percent of our farmers' cash receipts come from exports. In fact, exports account for 25 percent of the total value of all goods produced in this country. Exports mean jobs for our people, profits for our businesses, and growth for our economy. And that is why it is going to be a pleasure to present the well-deserved E and E Star Awards for excellence in exporting. But let me begin by pointing out the backdrop for export opportunities in the economic climate here at home. I know you are all familiar with the dramatic turnaround that has been accomplished. We are in the midst of a wonderful economic expansion, and I believe we have a lot to be proud of. Our growth is helping to pull the rest of the free world out of recession, and this will increase demand for American exports. But occasionally the interests of diplomacy and the interests of American industry seem to conflict. Well, our administration sees it as our job to reconcile the two and make it easier for American business to open up new markets on a fair footing. And we are working hard in that direction. In 1982 we passed the Export Trading Company Act aimed at opening foreign trade opportunities for medium- and small-sized companies. The bill removed impediments to trade, permitting companies to sell American products overseas more efficiently and more effectively. We are also implementing an international investment policy to reduce the number of government measures that distort or impede the flow of international investment. Our trade missions have been to Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, seeking to develop new export opportunities. Now, these are just several of the efforts. We are going to do everything we can to get government out of the way to make sure that you have the opportunity to compete effectively in world markets. Last November 1 visited Japan and Korea.

It is a pleasure for me to receive this award, representing a typical American family, and I want to thank you for it. As a matter of fact, I had my typical American family this past weekend at Camp David, 30 of the members of my family. After 2 or 3 intense days of negotiation, I think we reached a framework for peace among ourselves. It was nice to keep my family out of the news for a few days. It was one of the most delightful experiences in many years for me. We have a large family, a close family, an exciting family, and one which has given one another great help and support and encouragement in times of difficulty or excitement or joy or achievement or sorrow. There is nothing that gives me more pleasure, even as President of the United States, than to have Amy come to me in the evening, when I am tired and concerned and worried, and put her arms around my neck and give me a kiss. And she now is proud to call herself a double-digit preteenager. She is a great young lady and the joy of our lives. And I was able to have with me in the last few days my two grandsons. And we are expecting, I hope, a new granddaughter in just a few days from now. When I was invited to come here for this special observance of the family-what it means under the guidance of Jesus Christ and the great Nation of the United States of America, supported and strengthened by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, publicized and promoted by this special week I wondered what I wanted to say to you.

Only a deep faith could let the words of that song, All Is Well, ring out. In times when you and your forefathers were persecuted, driven one from another, crossed this land looking for freedom, a chance to worship in your own way, when perhaps you knew that you were about to die, when drought and thirst afflicted you and still the song rang out All Is Well. This is indeed a demonstration of an act of faith and a reaffirmation of hope. I come here as President of a great country. And in that same act of faith and in affirmation of hope, I tell you that our Nation can say all is well. And even the American family can be characterized by the same phrase, all is well. Because as was your early church in the minds and hearts of your own forefathers, so is our Nation and the family so precious, so dear, so innately good and right and decent and strong, that challenges to us, to our Nation, to the American family can successfully be withstood. I grew up in an isolated place, 3 miles west of Plains, Georgia, on a farm, where a family was indeed a self-contained community, where every member of the family felt wanted and loved and secure. Some plowed a mule; some carried and dropped a seed or fertilizer; some hoed out weeds; some carried water to the field for the others to drink; some took care of the hogs or the cows or the chickens; some kept the home secure. But in every instance each knew that the other one was contributing, and the children understood the function of the parents, and the parents understood and loved the children. And in our relatively primitive, isolated state of living, we were bound together by love. I first heard the Bible read in my family. I first heard prayer in my family. I learned about God within the family. There, in an embryonic stage of growth, I began to perceive the world around me. And when I had questions, they were answered. When I had doubts, they were resolved. When I had needs, they were met.

Our government spends a great deal of its time and effort, a great deal of your money repairing damages caused by weak or broken families. We have signs of deteriorating family structures in our country that cause us great concern. I agree with a rabbi named Heschel, who said, I have never understood how a father can take care of 12 children, and 12 children cannot take care of 1 father. And sometimes they act in error. When massive programs are put together through government, the individuality of human beings is sometimes forgotten and the sensitivity is lost. Our welfare programs, for instance, in some of their aspects, are antifamily. They function only when a father has actually left a home. And sometimes fathers leave homes temporarily, through subterfuge, sometimes permanently, just so a child can be fed. In our modern, mobile, permissive society, the basic moral strengths that bind families together are sometimes weakened or broken entirely. For every two marriages that took place in the United States last year, there was one divorce. For people born in the early years of this century and later married, only 1 out of 10 marriages resulted in divorce. For Americans born since World War II who married, one out of three marriages results in divorce. Teenage suicide has doubled in the last 10 years, and now the second most prevalent cause of death among male teenagers is suicide. Births out of wedlock are increasing rapidly. But these brutal and disturbing statistics are caused by a lack of strength among family members. Lily Tomlin says as a joke, We are all in this alone. And sometimes we feel that in a fast-moving, modern, technological society that we are alone, not as it was in former generations because of separation of distance because now we can be alone in a crowded apartment building, because our next-door neighbors remain strangers. All of us have weaknesses, faults, fears, yearnings, hopes, dreams, ideals that we cannot realize alone, and the support and the concern and the understanding and the care and, sometimes, the criticism and punishment in a constructive way help to repair our weaknesses.

The situation growing out of the prevailing railway and coal-mining strikes is so serious, so menacing to the nation's welfare, that I should be remiss if I failed frankly to lay the matter before you and at the same time acquaint you and the whole people with such efforts as the executive branch of the Government has made by the voluntary exercise of its good offices to effect a settlement. The suspension of the coal industry dates back to last April 1, when the working agreement between mine operators and the United Mine Workers came to an end. Anticipating that expiration of contract, which was negotiated with the Government's sanction in 1920, the present administration sought, as early as last October, conferences between the operators and miners in order to facilitate either a new or extended agreement in order to avoid any suspension of production when April 1 arrived. At that time the mine workers declined to confer, though the operators were agreeable, the mine workers excusing their declination on the ground that the union officials could have no authority to negotiate until after their annual convention. A short time prior to the expiration of the working agreement the mine workers invited a conference with the operators in the central competitive field, covering the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and in spite of the union declination of the Government's informal suggestion for the conference, five months before, the Government, informally but sincerely, commended the conference, but it was declined by certain groups of operators, and the coal-mining controversy ended in the strike of April 1. It was instantly made nation-wide, so far as the organized mine workers could control, and included many districts in the bituminous field where there was neither grievance nor dispute, and effected a complete tie-up of the production in the anthracite field. It is to be noted that when the suspension began large stocks of coal were on hand, mined at wages higher than those paid during the war, there was only the buying impelled by necessity, and there was a belief that coal must yield to the postwar readjustment. When the stocks on hand began to reach such diminution as to menace industry and hinder transportation, approximately June 1, overtures were initiated by the Government in the hope of expediting settlement. None of these availed.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressrailroadandcoalstrikes", "title": "Address to Congress on Railroad and Coal Strikes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-railroad-and-coal-strikes", "publication_date": "18-08-1922", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Warren G.

The dominant groups among the operators were insistent on having district agreements; the dominant mine workers were demanding a nation-wide settlement. The Government being without authority to enforce a strike settlement in the coal industry, could only volunteer its good offices in finding a way of adjustment. Accordingly, a conference of the coal operators' associations and the general and district officials of the United Mine Workers was called, to meet in Washington on July 1. The designation of representation was left to the officials of the various organizations, and there was nation-wide representation, except from the nonunion fields of the country. Before the joint meeting I expressed the deep concern of the country and invited them to meet at a conference table and end the disputes between them. The conference did not develop even a hope. The operators were asking for their district or territorial conferences; the workers demanded national settlement on old bases. Appraising correctly the hopelessness of the situation, I again invited both operators and workers to meet with me, and tendered a means of settlement so justly inspired that it was difficult to see how anyone believing in industrial peace and justice to all concerned could decline it. In substance, it called on the operators to open their mines, on the mine workers to resume work at the same pay and under the same working conditions as prevailed at the time the strike began. In turn, the Government was to create at once a coal commission, or two of them, if preferred by all parties to the dispute, so that one could deal with the bituminous situation, the other with the problems in the anthracite field. The commission was to be instructed to direct its first inquiry to the rate of wage to be paid for the period ending next April 1, and then to enter upon a fact-finding inquiry into every phase of the industry, and point the way to avoid future suspensions in production. The disputants all indorsed the suggestion of a fact-finding commission. The anthracite operators promptly accepted the entire proposal.

This fact was communicated to the governors of all coal-producing states, and with two exceptions assurances of maintained law and order were promptly given. In some instances concrete proof of effective readiness to protect all men, strikers and nonstriking workmen alike, was promptly given. The simple but significant truth was revealed that, except for such coal as comes from the districts worked by nonorganized miners, the country is at the mercy of the United Mine Workers. Governors in various states reported that their operators and miners had no dispute and were eager to resume production. District leaders informed me that their workmen were anxious to return to their jobs but that they were not permitted to do so. Hundreds of wives of workmen have addressed the White House, beseeching a settlement, alleging that they know no grievance, and there is an unending story of appeals for relief where necessity or suffering were impelling, where a mere expression of need ought to find ready compliance. At every stage, the Government has been a just neutral regarding wage scales and working contracts. There are fundamental evils in our present system of producing and distribution which make the wage problem difficult. In the bituminous coal fields are vastly more miners than are requisite to the country's needs, and there are 200,000 more mine workers than are needed to produce in continuous employment the country's normal requirements. By continuous employment I mean approximately 280 working-days in the year. In many instances last year men were employed less than 150 days, in some cases much fewer than that. In the overmanned sections men divide the working time, and high wages are necessary to meet the cost of the barest living.

I am speaking now on behalf of mine workers, mine operators, and the American public. It will bring protection to all and point the way to continuity of production and the better economic functioning of the industry in the future. The necessity for such a searching national investigation with constructive recommendation is imperative. At the moment the coal skies are clearing, but unless we find a cure for the economic ills which affect the industry and therein find a basis for righteous relationship, we shall be faced with a like menacing situation on next April 1 on the expiration of the wage contracts which are now being made. The need for such investigation and independent consideration is revealed by both operators and mine workers in the provision in the Cleveland agreement so recently made. The Government will gladly cooperate with the industry in this program so far as it is the public interest so to do, but I have an unalterable conviction that no lasting satisfaction or worth-while results will ensue unless we may have a Government commission, independent of the industry, clothed with authority by the Congress to search deeply, so that it may advise as to fair wages and as to conditions of labor and recommend the enactment of laws to protect the public in the future. The almost total exhaustion of stocks of coal, the crippled condition of the railways, the distressed situation that has arisen and might grow worse in our great cities due to the shortage of anthracite, the suffering which might arise in the Northwest through failure to meet the winter needs by lake transportation, all these added to the possibility of outrageous price demands, in spite of the most zealous voluntary efforts of the Government to restrain them, make it necessary to ask you to consider at once some form of temporary control of distribution and prices.

I do not mean that all interstate coal shall be handled by such a federal organization; perhaps none will be necessary; but it will restore its capital to the Public Treasury and will be the instrumentality of guarding the public interest where private conscience is insensible to a public need. This proposal does not relate to any possible employment in intrastate shipments. Price restraint and equitable distribution in intrastate shipments is a responsibility of the state's own government. In such voluntary activities as have been carried on thus far the federal Government has endeavored to reestablish the authority and responsibility in the states which was undermined in the necessary centralization of authority during the World War. The public menace in the coal situation was made more acute and more serious at the beginning of July by the strike of the Federated Shop Crafts in the railroad service-a strike against a wage decision made by the Railroad Labor Board, directly affecting approximately 400,000 men. The justice of the decision is not for discussion here. The decision has been lost sight of in subsequent developments. In any event, it was always possible to appeal for rehearing and the submission of new evidence, and it is always a safe assumption that a Government agency of adjustment deciding unjustly will be quick to make right any wrong. The Railroad Labor Board was created by Congress for the express purpose of hearing and deciding disputes between the carriers and their employees, so that no controversy need lead to an interruption in interstate transportation. Wages had, mounted upward, necessarily and justly, during the war upheaval, likewise the cost of transportation, so that the higher wages might be paid. It only held that the Labor Board was the lawful agency of the Government to hear and decide disputes, and its authority must be sustained, as the law contemplates. This must be so, whether the carriers or the employees ignore its decisions. Unhappily a number of decisions of this board had been ignored by the carriers. In only one instance, however, had a decision, challenged by a carrier, been brought to the attention of the Department of Justice, and this decision was promptly carried to the courts and has recently been sustained in the federal Court of Appeals. The public or the Executive had no knowledge of the ignored decisions in other cases, because they did not hinder transportation.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressrailroadandcoalstrikes", "title": "Address to Congress on Railroad and Coal Strikes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-railroad-and-coal-strikes", "publication_date": "18-08-1922", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Warren G.

The law creating the Railroad Labor Board is inadequate. Contrary to popular impression, it has little or no power to enforce its decisions. It can impose no penalties on either party disregarding its decisions. It cannot halt a strike, and manifestly Congress deliberately omitted the enactment of compulsory arbitration. The decisions of the board must be made enforceable and effective against carriers and employees alike. But the law is new, and no perfection of it by Congress at this moment could be helpful in the present threatened paralysis of transportation. Happily it is always lawful and ofttimes possible to settle disputes outside of court, so, in a desire to serve public welfare, I ventured upon an attempt at mediation. Those who had preceded me in attempted settlements had made some progress. I submitted to the officials of the striking employees and the chairman of the Association of Railway Executives, in writing, on the same day, a tentative proposal for settlement. Knowing that some of the carriers had offended by ignoring the decisions of the board, and the employees had struck when they had a remedy without the strike, I felt it was best to start all over again, resume work, all to agree to abide faithfully by the board's decisions, make it a real tribunal of peace in transportation, and everybody serve the public. The barrier to be surmounted was the question of seniority. By the workmen these rights are held to be sacred, and unsurrendered by a strike. By the carriers the preservation of seniority is the weapon of discipline on the one hand and the reward of faithful employees on the other. In the tentative proposal which I sponsored it was provided that everybody should go to work, with seniority rights unimpaired, that there should be no discrimination by either workmen or carriers against workmen who did or did not strike. I realized that the proposal must carry a disappointment to employees who had inherited promotion by staying loyally on the job, and to such new men as had sought jobs looking to permanent employment, but I wanted the fresh start and maintained transportation service, and I appraised the disappointment of the few to be less important than the impending misfortune to the nation.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressrailroadandcoalstrikes", "title": "Address to Congress on Railroad and Coal Strikes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-railroad-and-coal-strikes", "publication_date": "18-08-1922", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Warren G.

I believed that the matter of transcendent importance was the acceptance of the proposal to respect the Labor Board's decisions on the questions which formed the issue at the time of the strike. The public compensation would be complete in guarding by law against recurrence. The proposal was rejected by the carriers. Though the rejection did not end all negotiation, it left the Government only, one course- to call the striking workmen to return to work, to call the carriers to assign them to work, and leave the dispute about seniority to the Labor Board for decision. When negotiation or mediation fails, this is the course contemplated by the law and the Government can have no chart for its course except the law. To this call a majority of the carriers responded favorably, proposing to reemploy all strikers except those guilty of violence against workmen or property, to restore the striking workmen to their old positions where vacant, or to like positions where vacancies are filled; questions of seniority which can not be settled between the employer and employees to go to the Labor Board for decision. The minority of the carriers proposed to assign jobs to workmen on strike only where the positions were vacant. Thus the narrative brings us to the present moment, but it has not included the developments which have heightened the Government's concern. Sympathetic strikes have developed here and there, seriously impairing interstate commerce. Deserted transcontinental trains in the desert regions of the Southwest have revealed the cruelty and contempt for law on the part of some railway employees, who have con-spired to paralyze transportation, and lawlessness and violence in a hundred places have revealed the failure of the striking unions to hold their forces to law observance. Men who refused to strike and who have braved insult and assault and risked their lives to serve the public need have been cruelly attacked and wounded or killed. Men seeking work and guards attempting to protect lives and property, even officers of the federal Government, have been assaulted, humiliated, and hindered in their duties. Strikers have armed themselves and gathered in mobs about railroad shops to offer armed violence to any man attempting to go to work.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressrailroadandcoalstrikes", "title": "Address to Congress on Railroad and Coal Strikes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-railroad-and-coal-strikes", "publication_date": "18-08-1922", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Warren G.

Under these conditions of hindrance and intimidation there has been such a lack of care of motive power that the deterioration of locomotives and the noncompliance with the safety requirements of the law are threatening the breakdown of transportation. This very serious menace is magnified by the millions of losses to fruit growers and other producers of perishable foodstuffs, and comparable losses to farmers who depend on transportation to market their grains at harvest time. Even worse, it is hindering the transport of available coal when industry is on the verge of paralysis because of coal shortage, and life and health are menaced by coal famine in the great centers of population. Surely the threatening conditions must impress the Congress and the country that no body of men, whether limited in numbers and responsible for railway management or powerful in numbers and the necessary forces in railroad operation, shall be permitted to choose a course which so imperils public welfare. Neither organizations of employers nor workingmen's unions may escape responsibility. When related to a public service the mere fact of organization magnifies that responsibility and public interest transcends that of either grouped capital or organized labor. Another development is so significant that the hardships of the moment may well be endured to rivet popular attention to necessary settlement. It is fundamental to all freedom that all men have unquestioned rights to lawful pursuits, to work and to live and choose their own lawful ways to happiness. In these strikes these rights have been denied by assault and violence, by armed lawlessness. In many communities the municipal authorities have winked at these violations, until liberty is a mockery and the law a matter of community contempt. It is fair to say that the great mass of organized workmen do not approve, but they seem helpless to hinder. These conditions can not remain in free America. If free men can not toil according to their own lawful choosing, all our constitutional guaranties born of democracy are surrendered to mobocracy and the freedom of a hundred millions is surrendered to the small minority which would have no law.

The legal safeguarding against like menaces in the future must be worked out when no passion sways, when no prejudice influences, when the whole problem may be appraised, and the public welfare may be asserted against any and every interest which assumes authority beyond that of the Government itself. One specific thing I must ask at your hands at the earliest possible moment. It is a measure, in short, to create a jurisdiction for the federal courts through which the national Government will have appropriate power to protect aliens in the rights secured to them under treaties and to deal with crimes which affect our foreign relations. The matter has been before Congress on many previous occasions. President Tyler, in his first annual message, advised Congress that inasmuch as the Government is charged with the maintenance of peace and the preservation of amicable relations with the nations of the earth, it ought to possess without question all the reasonable and proper means of maintaining the one and preserving the other. President Harrison asked for the same bestowal of jurisdiction, having encountered deep embarrassment which grew out of the lynching of eleven aliens in New Orleans in 1891. President McKinley, dealing with a like problem in 1899, asked the conferring upon federal courts jurisdiction in that class of international cases where the ultimate responsibility of the federal Government may be involved. President Roosevelt uttered a like request to Congress in 1906, and President Taft pointed out the defect in the present federal jurisdiction when he made his inaugural address in 1909. He declared that it puts our Government in a pusillanimous position to make definite engagement to protect aliens and then to excuse the failure to perform these engagements by an explanation that the duty to keep them is in states or cities not within our control. If we would promise, we must put ourselves in a position to perform our promise. We can not permit the possible failure of justice, due to local prejudice in any state or municipal government, to expose us to the risk of war which might be avoided if federal jurisdiction were asserted by suitable legislation by Congress. My renewal of this oft-made recommendation is impelled by a pitiable sense of federal impotence to deal with the shocking crime at Herrin, Illinois, which so recently shamed and horrified the country. In that butchery of human beings, wrought in madness, it is alleged that two aliens were murdered.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressrailroadandcoalstrikes", "title": "Address to Congress on Railroad and Coal Strikes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-railroad-and-coal-strikes", "publication_date": "18-08-1922", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Warren G.

{"id": 6153, "text": "This act adds to the outraged sense of American justice the humiliation which lies in the federal Government's confessed lack of authority to punish that unutterable crime. Had it happened in any other land than our own, and the wrath of righteous justice were not effectively expressed, we should have pitied the civilization that would tolerate and sorrow for the Government unwilling or unable to mete out just punishment. I have felt the deep current of popular resentment that the federal Government has not sought to efface this blot from our national shield, that the federal Government has been tolerant of the mockery of local inquiry and the failure of justice in Illinois. It is the regrettable truth that the federal Government can not act under the law. But the bestowal of the jurisdiction necessary to enable federal courts to act appropriately will open the way to punish barbarity and butchery at Herrin or elsewhere, no matter in whose name or for what purpose the insufferable outrage is committed. It is deplorable that there are or can be American communities where even there are citizens, not to speak of public officials, who believe mob warfare is admissible to cure any situation. It is terrorizing to know that such madness may be directed against men merely for choosing to accept lawful employment. I wish the federal Government to be able to put an end to such crimes against civilization and punish those who sanction them. In the weeks of patient conference and attempts at settlement I have come to appraise another element in the engrossing industrial dispute of which it is only fair to take cognizance. It is in some degree responsible for the strikes and has hindered attempts at adjustments. I refer to the warfare on the unions of labor. The Government has no sympathy or approval for this element of discord in the ranks of industry. Any legislation in the future must be as free from this element of trouble making as it is from labor extremists who strive for class domination. We recognize these organizations in the law, and we must accredit them with incalculable contribution to labor's uplift. It is of public interest to preserve them and profit by the good that is in them, but we must check the abuses and the excesses which conflict with public interest, precisely as we have been progressively legislating to prevent capitalistic, corporate, or managerial domination which is contrary to public welfare.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscongressrailroadandcoalstrikes", "title": "Address to Congress on Railroad and Coal Strikes", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-railroad-and-coal-strikes", "publication_date": "18-08-1922", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Warren G.

The second thing I wanted to do is to commemorate those who have given their lives in the service of the country through the Central Intelligence Agency.

When President Truman autographed the photo of himself that hangs in this building, he wrote, To the CIA, a necessity to ENTITY of the United States from one who knows.

Like my predecessors, I have to look to the intelligence community for the answers to those questions. I look to you to warn me and, through me, our Nation of the threats, to spotlight the important trends in the world, to describe dynamics that could affect our interests around the world. The end of the cold war increases our security in many ways. You helped to win that cold war, and it is fitting that a piece of the Berlin Wall stands here on these grounds. But even now, this new world remains dangerous and, in many ways, more complex and more difficult to fathom. We need to understand more than we do about the challenges of ethnic conflict, militant nationalism, terrorism, and the proliferation of all kinds of weapons. Accurate, reliable intelligence is the key to understanding each of these challenges. And without it, it is difficult to make good decisions in a crisis or in the long-term. I know that working in the intelligence community places special demands on each and every one of you. It means you cannot talk freely about much of your work with your family and your friends. For some, it means spending a lot of time far away from home. For others, it is meant serving in situations of significant personal danger. While much of your work is sensitive and cannot be discussed publicly, I know what you do. I value it, and I respect you for doing it. And I wanted to come here to say thank you.

For nearly 30 years, you have advocated on behalf of those without a voice. For despite the real gains that we have made, there is still laws to change, and there is still hearts to open. There are still fellow citizens, perhaps neighbors, even loved ones, good and decent people, who hold fast to outworn arguments and old attitudes, who fail to see your families like their families, who would deny you the rights most Americans take for granted. And yet you continue, leading by the force of the arguments you make and by the power of the example that you set in your own lives as parents and friends, as PTA members and church members, as advocates and leaders in your communities. And you are making a difference. That is the story of the movement for fairness and equality and not just for those who are gay, but for all those in our history who've been denied the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, for all who've been told that the full blessings and opportunities of this country were closed to them. It is the story of progress sought by those with little influence or power, by men and women who brought about change through quiet, personal acts of compassion and defiance wherever and whenever they could.

I am here with you in that fight. For even as we face extraordinary challenges as a nation, we cannot and we will not put aside issues of basic equality. I greatly appreciate the support I have received from many in this room. I also appreciate that many of you do not believe progress has come fast enough.

You will see a time in which we as a nation finally recognize relationships between two men or two women as just as real and admirable as relationships between a man and a woman. You will see a nation that is valuing and cherishing these families, as we build a more perfect union, a union in which gay Americans are an important part. I am committed to these goals, and my administration will continue fighting to achieve them. And there is no more poignant or painful reminder of how important it is that we do so than the loss experienced by Dennis and Judy Shepard, whose son Matthew was stolen in a terrible act of violence 11 years ago. In May, I met with Judy who is here tonight with her husband I met her in the Oval Office, and I promised her that we were going to pass an inclusive hate crimes bill, a bill named for her son. Time and again we faced opposition. They turned tragedy into an unshakeable commitment. You held vigils; you spoke out, year after year, Congress after Congress. The House passed the bill again this week. And I can announce that after more than a decade, this bill is set to pass, and I will sign it into law. It is a testament to the decade-long struggle of Judy and Dennis, who tonight will receive a tribute named for somebody who inspired so many of us named for Senator Ted Kennedy, who fought tirelessly for this legislation. And it is a testament to the Human Rights Campaign and those who organized and advocated. And it is a testament to Matthew and to others who've been the victims of attacks not just meant to break bones, but to break spirits; not meant just to inflict harm, but to instill fear.

We are reinvigorating our response to ENTITY/ENTITY here at home and around the world.

Jeffrey Crowley, the Director of the Office of National ENTITY Policy, recently held a forum in Washington, DC, and is holding forums across the country to seek input as we craft a national strategy to address this crisis. We should not be punishing patriotic Americans who have stepped forward to serve this country. We should be celebrating their willingness to show such courage and selflessness on behalf of their fellow citizens, especially when we are fighting two wars.

It is about our common humanity and our willingness to walk in someone else's shoes, to imagine losing a job not because of your performance at work but because of your relationship at home, to imagine worrying about a spouse in the hospital with the added fear that you will have to produce a legal document just to comfort the person you love, to imagine the pain of losing a partner of decades and then discovering that the law treats you like a stranger. If we are honest with ourselves we will admit that there are too many who do not yet know in their lives or feel in their hearts the urgency of this struggle.

It was one in the morning, and it was the police. Now, her son Morty had been at the Stonewall the night of the raids. Ever since, he had felt within him a new sense of purpose. So, when the officer told Jeanne that her son had been arrested, which was happening often to gay protesters, she was not entirely caught off guard. And you know, he is homosexual. Why are you bothering him? And not long after, Jeanne would be marching side by side with her son through the streets of New York. She carried a sign that stated her support. Young men and women ran up to her, kissed her, and asked her to talk to their parents. And this gave Jeanne and Morty an idea. And so, after that march on the anniversary of the Stonewall protests, amidst the violence and the vitriol of a difficult time for our Nation, Jeanne and her husband Jules, two parents who loved their son deeply, formed a group to support other parents and, in turn, to support their children, as well. At the first meeting Jeanne held in 1973, about 20 people showed up. Morty's life tragically was cut short by ENTITY, but the cause endured. Today, the organization they founded for parents, families, and friends of lesbians and gays has more than 200,000 members and supporters. It is made a difference for countless families across America. I did not even cross the street against the light. But I was not going to let anybody walk over Morty. of ordinary citizens organizing, agitating, and advocating for change; of hope stronger than hate; of love more powerful than any insult or injury; of Americans fighting to build for themselves and their families a nation in which no one is a second-class citizen, in which no one is denied their basic rights, in which all of us are free to live and love as we see fit.

I am committed to making sure that you always are that and to doing whatever we have to do to improve the quality of life and the conditions of living, so that the best people in America want to be in the military and want to stay in the military. Since I have been President, I have twice had to go back to Congress to ask for large appropriations totaling over $35 billion to help to maintain our training, our readiness, and our quality of life. And this year I asked the Congress for a supplemental appropriation to cover contingencies in the Defense Department so we could fund a pay increase at the maximum legal level allowable and continue to make improvements in readiness and the quality of life. We are going to continue to do that. If you are committed to serving America, the people who make the decisions about investments in your future should be committed to making sure that you can serve and succeed, that you can have good families and a good life in the United States military. And we are very grateful to you for that. Let me say, what I most wanted to do was to have a chance to say thank you personally and to go down the row and shake hands with the children.

It is a country with which we are bound by ties of common ideals and principles, and ties of blood. Many of their people have come to this country and indeed, in their country, they celebrate one of our holidays. It has a long and interesting history. And of course, standing as it does as a buttress between the Baltic and the North Seas, it is not strange that they have had a long maritime history. But in these later days it is one of the key countries in the NATO alliance. Geographically it looks across a very narrow gap to the threatening dictatorship that creates so much tension and indeed so much ill will in this world. So we are proud to call them friend and ally. We need them. We hope that they feel, on their part, a sense of partnership and need for us. Many of you no doubt visited the Castle of Hamlet, and for my part at least, I was astonished to find out that Hamlet never lived in Denmark. It is a country of people calm and serene; they seem never to be startled, never to be hysterical. they were always hysterical in victory and panicky in defeat. I think the people of Denmark would be the last people that you could say that about, if you went there and wanted to make a generalization. In any event, it is a great country a prosperous country and above all, one with us, believing in the dignity of man and ready to put everything on the line; to risk even their existence in the defense of these values that free men feel are above all else in life. So you can realize that it is with a great sense of distinction that I ask you all to rise with me to drink to Their Majesties, the King and Queen of Denmark. The Queen and I are deeply moved by the kind words you have addressed to us and by the hearty welcome which you and Mrs. Eisenhower as well as the inhabitants of this beautiful city of Washington have given us. The kind hospitality with which we have been met by everybody during this first part of our stay in the United States has made a great impression on us and will always be kept in grateful memory by the Queen and myself.

A world war with its terror and suffering for millions of people lies between then and now. During the dark years of war our two countries each with the means at her disposal aimed at promoting a common cause. We Danes realize how much we owe to the United States, to the courage and sacrifice of the American people, to the indomitable leadership of outstanding individuals as your memorable predecessors and you yourself, Mr. President, and to the dedicated efforts of the United States to achieve a peace based .on freedom and justice for all nations. I wish to take this opportunity to express on behalf of all my countrymen our gratitude towards the United States for their share in the liberation of our country. When peace had been achieved, we were faced with a series of new problems. As a result of the war the economy of my country like that of most other European countries had suffered severe setbacks. The rebuilding and expansion of our means of production and our merchant fleet and the revival of our commerce would not have been completed today had not the United States Government carried out their large-scale aid programs. Through this assistance the United States significantly helped the cause of economic integration in Western Europe. Your country thereby made an inestimable contribution to the unity of the states in our region. It is in my view a major interest, not only of Western Europe, but also of its friends in this hemisphere, that the cause of ever closer cooperation between European nations should enjoy the sympathy and active support of the United States of America. At the same time dark and menacing clouds were again gathering on the international horizon and prevented the peoples of the world from enjoying the peace for which they had fought so bitterly. Certainly those clouds still darken the sun, but thanks to inspiration and support from the United States the free nations of the Western World have joined their efforts to avert the threats to their national existence and their free way of life. Our country and yours are united in NATO. During the past 11 years we have had ample proof of the solidarity of the United States with NATO. We have benefited from the magnanimous aid which has enabled Denmark to build up a defense system without endangering the economic and social stability which are also important links in total defense.", "label": "monologic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstoaststhepresidentandkingfrederikdenmark", "title": "Toasts of the President and King Frederik of Denmark", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/toasts-the-president-and-king-frederik-denmark", "publication_date": "11-10-1960", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Dwight D.

However, we are fully aware that solidarity with our allies is a necessity if the alliance is to fulfill its mission. The establishment of common defense areas in Greenland, upon which Denmark and the United States agreed in 1951, is one of the Danish contributions to that end. During our recent visit to Greenland the Queen and I had the pleasure to visit one of these areas and to inspect the forces stationed there. The high efficiency of these forces gained and deserved our sincere admiration. While both of us see in the alliance which unites us a purely defensive instrument and a successful means to avert the horrors of a new war, we are not closing our eyes to, but indeed seeking, all possible means to diminish the present tension in the world. We are grateful to you, Mr. President, for your untiring, personal efforts in the cause of peace and good will. They are the ultimate proof of the peaceful aims to which the policy of the United States as well as Denmark are dedicated. The close cooperation between our two countries in the United Nations and other international organizations is based on an identity of views with respect to the fundamental elements of life and stamped by mutual respect and sympathy. To this contribute in no slight degree the ties which unite many Americans of Danish origin with the land of their ancestors. for centuries Danes have gone to the United States to work and study. Many of them stayed on and founded their new homes in their country of adoption; we are happy to meet them here as esteemed and mostly prosperous citizens of this great country. New bonds of friendship have been created by the ever increasing numbers of American visitors coming to Denmark and Danes going to the United States. A most useful and ever increasing exchange of scientists, students, teachers, etc., has developed since the war thanks to American generosity and planning. This constitutes an essential factor in the cultural relations between our two countries. Tourist travel also is becoming possible for wider and wider groups of our citizens, thanks to the rising standards of living and the progress in the means of transportation. We Danes have always been proud of our merchant marine. In the field of air transportation we have by pooling our resources with our sister nations, Norway and Sweden significantly assisted in making connections between your country and Scandinavia easier and closer.

First, our administration has worked hard to make sure all women have access to prenatal care. We know when women get medical attention before a baby is born, that child is much more likely to be born healthy. And good health is the most precious gift we can offer a child or a family. Second, we worked with Congress to make sure that every woman covered by Federal Government health insurance has reproductive health care coverage, including prescription contraceptives. That was a significant step for more than a million American women, and it set a standard for insurance coverage around the country. Third, when I took office, we faced an epidemic of teen pregnancy-children having children. Over the last 7 years, we have reached out to community groups, schools, and health professionals working in an amazing network of American citizens from all walks of life. And together, the American people have cut teen pregnancy by 15 percent. Fourth, we have made a broad range of family planning and sex education programs more widely available for all Americans. And by making sure women have family planning choices, we are helping to make abortion more rare. Today I am glad to announce we will be increasing funds for family planning and reproductive health care by $35 million next year. My budget for 2001 will include $274 million in grants for clinics and community-based health services that reach more than 5 million women and families. It will fund counseling for teenagers and support educational programs that encourage young people to postpone sexual activity. It will help more than 4,600 clinics screen for cancer, ENTITY, and other diseases. And it will fund partnerships with community organizations and health care professionals who are reaching out to teenagers and others at risk. These services make a critical difference in people's lives. They help working women who otherwise could not afford medical tests that may save their lives. They help ENTITY patients who desperately need counseling and assistance. They provide support and information to young people who may not know the basics of caring for a newborn child. They give women access to the full range of reproductive health care before and during pregnancy. It is in the interest of every American that no one miss out on this kind of care and that no child miss the chance for a healthy start.

First of all, we congratulate India and the people of India on an historic national election, which saw more voters cast their ballots freely and fairly than in any election in human history. We congratulate Narendra Modi and the BJP on winning a majority of seats in this historic election. Once the government is formed, we look forward to working closely with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet to advance our strong bilateral relationship based on shared democratic values.

I am sorry, the question -- I understand about the visa, but what is the question? Do you think that was a wrong step taken by the previous administration, or do you stand by that? Well, I would refer you to the State Department for general answers to questions about the issuance of visas. I can tell you that the Prime Minister of India will be welcomed to the United States.

What is the future of the U.S.-India relationship? We have long said that we look forward to working with whomever the Indian people choose in these elections.

Is it essential still to the White House that whatever finally emerges from Congress include a path to citizenship? It is elemental to the principles that he put forward. It is reflected in the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate. And the President strongly believes that it needs to be a part of comprehensive immigration reform. We have long said that the House would necessarily pursue its own path in the construction of an immigration reform package, but comprehensive immigration reform is essential because the whole works together in a way that achieves all of the important benefits to the economy and to the country that we are looking for with the passage of this legislation. So I am not going to get into a lot of parsing of what ifs because we have not seen a thing out of the House yet, and we are looking forward to the House acting on the urges we have heard expressed and the interest and desire that we have heard expressed by Republicans, including Republican leaders on this matter. And we want to see comprehensive immigration reform. We want to see comprehensive immigration reform that meets the test set by the President when he laid out his principles a number of years ago.

But what he does insist is that comprehensive immigration reform adhere to the principles he laid out in the beginning. So whatever the legislative process, not parsing that, the final bill that he would sign into law must include a path to citizenship? We have said all along that comprehensive immigration reform needs to include a path to citizenship. And he will not sign a law that is short of that? He will not sign a bill that does not include a path to citizenship -- that is my question. He signs a lot of bills that do not include paths to citizenship. You know what I mean. I know what you mean, too, but what I am not going to do is -- So you are saying -- so he is open to signing an immigration bill that falls short of a path to citizenship? His position, unlike the position of others, has been absolutely consistent from beginning to end -- or to this point. Unfortunately, we are not at the end yet, and I do not expect it to change. And then on the VA, I have heard you and I have heard others at the White House talk about the VA as having a good record on dealing with the backlog of claims and actually praising the VA on this issue. In light of the way this -- as we learn more about problems and not just in the Arizona office, but in other parts of the country, are you still saying you think that the Veterans Administration has done a good job in dealing with the backlog of claims? I mean, are you still going to say that? I appreciate the question, ENTITY, and I think it is important to note -- and I tried to the other day when this came up -- you are conflating two separate things. The disability claims, the backlog and disability claims -- this is a specific problem and challenge that the VA and the White House and others in the administration have been aggressively attacking.

That is the first time that is ever been done; that is what this administration did. If you were a veteran of the first Gulf War and you felt that you were a victim of problems associated with exposure in that war, and if you were a veteran of Iraq or Afghanistan and you experience Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, again, your claim would clear a hurdle automatically under this process that we established in this administration because we believe our veterans deserve it. That immediately increased the population of people who had disability claims added to the backlog, and that backlog has been a focus of intense work and attention by the VA and the administration in general. On the matter of the absolute requirement that our veterans get the health care and services that they deserve and they get that in a timely fashion, the revelations or at least the allegations that have emerged from the situation in Phoenix I think have been greeted, in terms of reaction in the manner that Secretary Shinseki suggested yesterday, with a great deal of anger and frustration. But these are matters -- and other issues that have been discussed in the wake of those allegations -- that are properly under review at the order of Secretary Shinseki, under investigation at the recommendation of Secretary Shinseki by the independent inspector general. And as you know, the President and Chief of Staff here have responded to Secretary Shinseki's recommendation by sending one of the President's most trusted aides over to VA to help with that review, to work with Secretary Shinseki on that review. So I think that reflects the seriousness with which we approach this matter, our concern about some of the allegations that have been made. But I just wanted to make sure that it was understood that there is a -- that the disability claims issue is not the same issue that is being discussed when we talk about the allegations in Phoenix. I think part of the confusion is when you and others have been asked about the problems in terms of veterans getting the health care that they need and deserve, you have answered with talking points on the disability claim backlog.

What I have been saying is that under Secretary Shinseki's leadership there has been a firm dedication to providing the kind of services that our veterans deserve. It is reflected in some of the decisions that were made to increase access to disability claims and to health care. We have under his leadership reduced veterans homelessness by 24 percent. We have provided Post-9/11 GI Bill educational benefits to more than 1 million students. And we have decreased the disability claims. My point is that when I talk about the progress that has been made, I have been referring to questions about Secretary Shinseki and his leadership of the Veterans Affairs Department, and that progress has come on his watch and he certainly deserves credit for it. Do you think it sounds strange, though, that given the evidence that we are seeing coming out and suggestions that veterans have actually died waiting to get health services -- I think the word you used is essential because you said the suggestion. And this matter is under investigation -- I would point you to what the IG said yesterday. But here you are praising the VA for all the things that have been done under Shinseki's leadership. Let me just explain the way you just asked that question. You are saying there is a suggestion that something terrible happened in Phoenix -- and that is under investigation. But you do not think there is evidence that there has been a real problem with the quality of health care that our veterans are getting? You do not think that this is going to be -- we still need to study this further? You do not think there is enough to act on right now to say that our veterans are not getting the care that they need? you are going to investigate more? We should just accept allegations as true without investigating them? Meanwhile, we are moving aggressively in a host of areas to ensure that our veterans are getting the services and the care that they deserve. And that is reflected not least in the fact that the President has requested increases in the budget for the VA every year he has been in office in a time of very tight budgets.

It seems to me he has made a conclusion in his mind that something bad happened. I think I would refer you to his testimony. And that is an opinion shared by the President, by Secretary Shinseki, and I think everyone else who has looked at this matter and works on these issues. Why has not he expressed it? The President was asked about the allegations and answered forthrightly and expressed his concern about it. The actions that we have taken reflect the concern that we have about it. And the fact that he has sent one of his most trusted and top aides from the White House over to the VA to assist the Secretary in his review reflects the seriousness with which we take this matter.

I am not in any way prejudging, because I do not think we ought to prejudge. I do think that it is a matter of enough concern that the actions that Secretary Shinseki has taken and the actions that the President and the White House have taken are merited, and we will continue to aggressively tackle this problem.

ENTITY, on that point about the President speaking out -- today, for the second time this week alone, he talked about transportation funding, infrastructure funding because it is a priority for him.

The President has asked his Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, one of his most trusted advisors, to temporarily take an assignment over at the VA to assist Secretary Shinseki in that effort. And Secretary Shinseki, as you know, was testifying on Capitol Hill just yesterday about this. This is something that, again, the President cares deeply about when it comes to our veterans and ensuring that we provide for them in a way that honors the service they provided us.

How do you react directly to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor?

My question being is there any fear that this is a big -- I struggle to use the word distraction because it is an important issue that veterans get their health care, but is this something that overshadows the attention of Congress right now so you cannot get immigration and other stuff done? I would simply say that it is an important matter and that the resources necessary to tackle it so that we are providing the services and benefits that veterans deserve are merited, and the attention that is paid to it by those who are concerned about the problem as opposed to politics is absolutely appropriate. That is how the President views it. Does the government have any confidence, this administration have any confidence that the Nigerians can ever retrieve the young women, particularly in light of today's news that President Jonathan was supposed to go to the village from which they were kidnapped and decided at the last minute not to go? Well, I would say that, first of all, a couple of things. There is no question that the Nigerian people, the Nigerians face a real threat in Boko Haram.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney124", "title": "Barack Obama Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-124", "publication_date": "16-05-2014", "crawling_date": "04-07-2023", "politician": ["Jay Carney"], "gender": ["M"]}}

So this organization poses a serious threat in that country. When it comes to the efforts undertaken by the Nigerian government to find these girls, we have made clear that, in our view, time is of the essence and that we can and are assisting the Nigerian government in the search, but the Nigerian government has the lead and needs to act accordingly. But they do not seem to be making any progress. No, signs from Nigeria are not encouraging. Well, I think a circumstance -- I mean, I think that it was important -- and I tried to do this when we first started talking about the assistance the United States was going to provide -- to understand that despite the expertise we have, the capacities we have, and the kind of assets that we can bring to bear in this, that this is a tremendous challenge. We are talking about fewer than 300 people who are being searched for in an area at least the size of West Virginia, portions of which are very densely forested, as I understand it. And, again, this is a population of kidnapped girls that we hope remains intact and together, but obviously if they have been separated that makes the challenge even greater -- which does not mean that we will not provide all the assistance and assets that we can in that effort in helping Nigeria conduct this search, but it is certainly a challenge. But the security situation is apparently so bad that the President of the country cancelled a visit to the area today. I think the fact that the security situation, because of Boko Haram, is real is one that is self-evident and which I discussed moments ago. But that does not mean that we cannot and that they cannot conduct a search, and that is certainly what is happening. We have already, as I discussed earlier this week, launched both manned and unmanned aircraft as part of the reconnaissance effort, and we have a team of personnel assisting the Nigerian government in a variety of ways. Other nations have lent their support to the effort and we hope that it will bear fruit and we will find the girls.

What is the anticipation on the part of this White House about the tangibles that might come out of that meeting -- the series of meetings? I think that we are focused on assisting the Nigerians in developing a concrete plan and a concrete approach to finding out where the girls are and recovering them so that they can be returned to their families. And that requires coordination and it requires strategy. And I assume that these conversations will be focused on that effort. Going back to ENTITY's line of questioning, you have Alice Friend, who is the Director of African Affairs, talking about some of her frustrations, frustrations on the part of the United States with the Nigerian government's slow to adapt with new strategies and new tactics. Can you flesh out what some of the other frustrations are that the U.S. feels in terms of working with the government of Nigeria? Well, look, I think that the challenge that Nigeria faces from this group is a serious one, and there are all sorts of issues that she and others have identified that make the challenge even greater and that we try to address as a friend of Nigeria in the assistance that we provide. That is why we provide security assistance, to increase Nigeria's capacity to meet the threat, including by helping professionalize its military and helping it carry out responsible counterterrorism operations. It is why we provide law enforcement assistance, to help Nigeria bring those responsible for attacks on civilians to justice. It is why we support programs and initiatives that are aimed at combating violent extremist ideology, including by creating economic alternatives for those vulnerable to being recruited by terrorist organizations. So we have a coordinated effort that is designed to help strengthen Nigeria's ability to respond responsibly and effectively to these challenges in a way that ensures civilians are protected and human rights are respected. And responding responsibly and effectively is important because that is , in effect, how you provide support for and reassurance to the population that is also having to deal with the threat posed by an organization like Boko Haram.

The White House has repeatedly expressed confidence in Shinseki's leadership, progress under his watch. But the way that this all came out -- even if you are going to keep calling them all allegations and they seem to be more widespread than one hospital -- does not that in itself indicate a major shortfall in his oversight and leadership of the administration? Michelle, I think I have addressed this question. What we have seen in response to the allegations that have been reported is a review instigated by the Secretary, one that we are now providing a senior White House official to assist -- My question is the way it came out, that this was all -- all of these problems that have been built up and widespread, it all came out through reporting by the press, that some of this was not even known about. So does not that, in and of itself, indicate a major shortfall there? Well, I'd say a couple of things about that. First of all, there are active reviews and investigations into what happened, and I think, again, I am not going to pass judgment on what happened until we have seen the conclusion of an investigation. Separately, should some of these allegations prove to be true, Secretary Shinseki has made clear that he would be outraged by that and angry by that -- the President certainly would be -- and he would expect people to be held accountable. On the role of the press, I think the press, in general -- and again, I am not going to pass judgment on whether or not the allegations are true because we do not know, but the role of the press is important in general as a -- on matters like this and in so many other areas. So I would not sell the press short when it comes to the important role they play. And on Iran, these reports that have come out this week that Iran is actively pursuing ballistic missiles, what is the White House's view of that and the possibility of eventually reaching a nuclear deal? Well, on the question of ballistic missiles, we have made clear that all issues of concern are on the table during the P5-plus-1 negotiations aimed at reaching a comprehensive agreement.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney124", "title": "Barack Obama Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-124", "publication_date": "16-05-2014", "crawling_date": "04-07-2023", "politician": ["Jay Carney"], "gender": ["M"]}}

It also talks about U.N. Security Council resolutions needing to be addressed, including provisions relating to ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead. So ballistic missiles fall into the topics under discussion that would need to be part of a comprehensive resolution of this dispute and this challenge. Without sort of teasing out any individual item and talking about how that concern would have to be addressed in the final product, what we will do is point you to those U.N. Security Council resolutions, the fact that the Joint Plan of Action explicitly calls for those concerns to be resolved, and make clear that everything in the JPA is on the table and has to be resolved for a comprehensive agreement to be reached. ENTITY, I have two questions. On the Ukraine elections, a statement that the Vice President put out this week used the word, delegitimize in the statement, that Russia would face additional costs should it disrupt or delegitimize the election results. My question is a follow-up on a question earlier, which is who is the arbiter for the results of the election, whether they are disrupted or delegitimized, since sectoral sanctions would be so important to determine a range. Who decides that? Well, first of all, there will be international observers organized by the OSCE who will be able to make judgments about the conduct of the election and any efforts to undermine the election or delegitimize it. The United States and the rest of our partners in the international community who have taken one side on this matter, and Russia, which has taken another side, I think will make judgments about how the elections proceed. President Putin, back when he also said or suggested that the so-called referenda should not be held on May 11, also said that the May 25 election might be a good step.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney124", "title": "Barack Obama Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-124", "publication_date": "16-05-2014", "crawling_date": "04-07-2023", "politician": ["Jay Carney"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I am not suggesting that he is ill, but here is the question -- I cannot find any public record that the President has had his full medical workup, his usual exam, since before the election. And maybe I missed it. Can you tell us, update us when -- I will have to take the question. I have not looked into that. Yesterday the FCC voted to create what they call Internet fast lanes. I am wondering, the President, as candidate in 2007, 2008, said he would oppose such efforts. Is the President disappointed by the FCC decision, or is he contemplating going back on his campaign promise from six years ago? The President has made clear since he was a candidate, ENTITY, that he strongly supports net neutrality and an open Internet. As he has said, the Internet's incredible equality of data, content and access to the consumer is what has powered extraordinary economic growth and made it possible for once tiny sites like eBay and Amazon to compete with brick-and-mortar operations. The FCC is an independent agency, as you know, and we will carefully review their proposal. The FCC's efforts were dealt a real challenge by the Court of Appeals in January, but Chairman Wheeler has said his goal is to preserve an open Internet, and we are pleased to see that he is keeping all options on the table. We will be watching closely as the process moves forward in hopes that the final rule stays true to the spirit of net neutrality. The President is looking at every way to protect a free and open Internet and we will -- and he will consider any option that might make sense. Does the rule that was passed yesterday meet the President's standards for net neutrality? Again, I think the rule -- what was passed yesterday was something that kept options on the table. Well, if you have all options on the table, then the President will be looking very closely to see that the outcome of this results in a final rule that stays true to the spirit of net neutrality, which he supports.

I would refer you to the department for any status update they might have.

I think the President, as a father who also has on his staff others who are parents, knows that this is a topic that a lot of families are discussing right now as more and more information is provided about the problems associated with concussions in sports, especially for our young. And we have the ability here, because it is the White House and because he is the President, to help elevate this issue and help draw attention to it and support for efforts to make progress on it so that we can ensure that our kids are being able to get all the benefits that come from participating in sports but are able to do so in as safe a way as possible. I do not have a list of attendees at this time. What I can tell you is we are not prepared to announce participants or commitments at this time, but the President recognizes that raising awareness of and better protecting children and student athletes from concussions, and better identifying and treating them when they do occur requires a team approach.

So this is something that I think a lot of families spend a lot of time worrying about and want to know as much as they can about, and want to be sure that they are taking all the precautions they can on behalf of their children so their children can get all the great experiences that come from participating in sports. How does he prepare for an event like this? Is he reading books? Frontline has done some documentaries.

You would have to speak to him about his views on this matter. First of all, I think we have made clear that we congratulate the Indian people and Mr. Modi and his party on their victory. We await the formation of a government, and we absolutely look forward to continuing all the progress that we have made in our bilateral relationship, and fully expect to be able to do so.

I do not have a readout on all his conversations, but I would certainly point you to what Secretary Hagel said and certainly we support his efforts in this area.

I have not spoken to him directly about this issue, but I would note what Secretary Hagel said and that we support him.

There was a good story this morning about the First Lady and how that decision affected her life, which I think speaks to why it is so appropriate for her to be speaking on it tonight. We have more work to do, and that is why the President has the aggressive education agenda that he has. That is why he is focused on making pre-kindergarten education available to all in this country, because that early start is so essential for a child's future. So I think that we have come a long way in 60 years, and this is an important anniversary to note.

Democratic Governors are supporting it overwhelmingly. But some of the old thinkers in Congress want to have Congress tell these schools how to do it. They are subject to the power of the labor union in education. But I am not worried about that labor union, the NEA. They never voted for me in their life. The union fights me.

Any time you have got a bad economy, people are going to look at anybody that is in office. One of the reasons you see term limits so popular, and I support them, is people are saying, Hey, they are not helping us. I cannot ask a guy that is thrown out of work at Compaq to think everything I am doing is perfect. But what I will do in the campaign is draw the lines and say, Here is what I have tried to do. Do you know this? And if you believe in it, send me some help up there. But yes, I think the economy is going to be the driving factor in these elections. The lack of consumer confidence worries me because if they hear all this bad news all the time, people are going to get gloomy about it. It is a good time to buy a house. It is a good time to buy a car. But as long as people are worrying about their jobs, they hold back.

Your Government seems to be determined to end the regime of Saddam Hussein by any means necessary. This seems to include military options. Is there any way that this man, this dictator, can address your concerns and stay in power? Or are we drifting towards a war? Well, first, let me say this, that Iraq ought to be on the minds of the German people, and they ought to be on the minds of the American people, because the Iraq Government is a dangerous Government. Iraq ought to be centerpiece in our thinking. This is a Government that is gassed its own people. This is a Government that is not transparent, and this is a Government we know wants to develop weapons of mass destruction. They may have weapons of mass destruction; we just do not know. And for the good of freedom and for the good of our future, we have got to deal with it. Now, I am not going to-I have no military plans on my desk that calls for-that plots out a military operation. I am looking at all options. And of course, I will consult closely with our allies and friends. I look forward to talking this subject with the Chancellor of Germany.

Remember-let us start with affirmative action-remember, there was a lot of pressure to eliminate affirmative action, both from the Republican Party and from some court decisions, which required us to change it. And we took the position that we should mend it, not end it, and that is the position that Vice President Gore has steadily defended. I noticed in his third debate that he was the only candidate who would say that he was for affirmative action. And I can tell you, we had long, long discussions about this. He believes strongly in it. And I believe virtually every one of our candidates for the Senate and the House does. I know that my wife, who is running for the Senate in New York, strongly feels that way, and I believe all the others do, as well. So I think you can feel very good about that.

So what does Al Gore want to do? What do the rest of our Democrats want to do? They want to finish the job of putting 100,000 qualified teachers in our schools. They want to provide funds to poor school districts especially, and growing school districts, to build new school buildings and to overhaul others. They want to finish the work of connecting all the schools in the country to the Internet and all the classrooms. When Al Gore took on this project for our administration in 1994, only 3 percent of the classrooms were connected. Today, 65 percent of the classrooms are, and 90 percent of the poorest schools have at least one Internet connection. So we want to do that. He wants to provide universal preschool and more after-school programs for the kids who need it, and he wants tax deductibility for college tuition. Plus which, we have a Hispanic Education Action Plan that is designed to deal with the fact that the dropout rate among Latino students is still too high, and he has promised to build on that. So we have got a very, very good education program. It is been our top domestic priority, and I think you can really depend on the Vice President to deliver. That is why both the major teachers' organizations have endorsed him, and a lot of other educators around the country, because they believe that we have a program based on the research and what the educators are saying. He has got a good accountability program that we ought to identify failing schools, turn them around, or open them under new management. And all over America, you see these schools that were in trouble just a couple of years ago that are turning around. I was in a school in Harlem the other day where 2 years ago, 80 percent of the children were doing math and reading below grade level, and today, three-quarters of the kids are doing math and reading above or at grade level. That is after only 2 years. So we have got a program that is working out there at the grassroots. We need to bring it to all of America, and you can trust Al Gore to do that. He cares a lot about it.

I think that something very definite would go out of America if we ever forgot our heritage. That is sort of like all of us came here from someplace else or by way of our ancestors-our parents, grandparents, and so forth and that is a little like getting on board and once we are on board let us pull up the gangplank and not let anyone else on. Does that mean you would not support the immigration bill that is now Oh, I am supporting the immigration bill because I think we have to have rules and regulations, and I think what that bill is meant to correct is some loss of control at our borders, where illegal immigration is threatening us now. No, we have to have control and have had; it is been traditional in our country for many years. And I agree with that, and I agree with the part of the legislation which says that some people even if they did illegally enter the country in times past have established themselves, have been law-abiding, raised children, and so forth here that there should be a provision whereby their status can be made legal and permanent. This weekend, which is a celebration of liberty and our 100th anniversary of our lady in the harbor, do you feel that South African blacks should have that same kind of liberation?

I mean, what kind of things have they done? Well, we have expressed our displeasure with the state of emergency. What we believe is that there must come a meeting and negotiations between leaders of the various black elements and the present government as to the formation of a government. Now, they have taken such steps as single citizenship already. They have done some things about the onerous pass laws and all of that the right of labor unions and so forth. They have arrested all the labor union leaders though, sir. I know, and this was part of, again, this emergency thing that we think should be done away with. But I think the complication that is overlooked too often is that it is not solidly a racial division between the white minority and the black majority. The black majority itself is divided, and there are tribal divisions that have a long time heritage there in Africa. And we have seen that in the violence between those groups now. Is there something the United States can do to bring that about? Well, we are continuing to try, and I think that we have a better chance by remaining in contact with that government than following the lead that is been suggested up on the Hill with some legislation in which we would walk totally away and then be on the outside with no contact at all.

But might you allow the military to use some of its assets, like radar Well, yes, and, as I say, if increasing that will help, because we already have that at work. I might also add that the military, like every other facet of our society, had its own problem with drugs internally. And they have done a magnificent job. They have virtually reduced it almost to zero in the military. I think what we have to face is there is a limit to what success we can have with simply trying to shut off the inflow of drugs, to take the drugs away from the users. I know that what Nancy's been engaged in is, I think, what ultimately must be the answer, and that is to take the user away from the drugs, to turn the users off.

We must remember our relationship with Austria is a relationship between two nations, and Austria and the United States have had a friendly relationship and one which we hope will be maintained.

Does it trouble you that there are articles being written, America cannot get anything into the sky how could we possibly have a defense shield? Well, I think before we get around to anything of that kind, we are still in such a state of research, although great progress is being made. But we still have some years of research ahead of us on this before and I think the other problem will be taken care of long before there is any need for testing. We also wanted to ask you some personal questions. Is there anything that you wish you had been that you have not been? But is there any other profession that you would like? No, I will tell you again. The Lord has been very good to me. When I was a sports announcer, I loved that, and I believed that that would probably be my career on out and was very happy with it. And then the opportunity came to switch to what originally had been a love of mine-acting and I enjoyed that very much. I was a reluctant entrant into public life. I never believed for one minute that I would ever be tempted to want to serve in public office. As I say, I was so happy in what I was doing. And I was really kind of dragged kicking and screaming into seeking the governorship and thought that what I was doing was kind of a very temporary thing, because it was put to me on the basis that, with our party very divided after the '64 campaign, at odds that I might be able to help bring the party together, and that I offered a chance for victory in that gubernatorial race. And I have often said that I think when I finally, grudgingly, said yes that I really thought no farther than the election.

Okay, now you are in the White House. How does that, you know, with the whir of choppers, the Ruffles and Flourishes how does that make the governorship look and all the things in the past? Well, I will tell you, I am very grateful for that period there, because I think the closest thing to the Presidency in line of a job is being a Governor. There you sit at a desk in which the buck does stop when it gets there, and there is a great similarity. We are a federation of sovereign States, and so, the Governor sits closest to the salt in his State, above anyone except the President. Karen mentioned the whir of helicopters.

How do you respond with some ideas about your own vision? I think we are all deeply grateful to the generation of D-Day and the Second War for what they did and the freedom they bought us. I think we are also grateful to those who fought and won the cold war. And what we have to do now is to work out how we are going to face the challenges of the post-cold-war era and what our responsibilities are. The United States is still prepared to lead in a world in which our concerns are clear- security, prosperity, democracy, and human rights-and in which we know there is an interdependence, a level of cooperation required, because we want to maintain a discipline that was not there before the Second World War, a discipline that was not there before World War II, a discipline that will permit us to work on these problems, contain those we cannot control, and prevent the whole world from becoming engulfed again. And that is what we are attempting to do in working with the British, the French, and others in Bosnia, what we are attempting to do in leading NATO to take action out of area for the first time and trying to support the attempt to secure peace in Bosnia. That is what we are trying to do with the Partnership For Peace. Eighteen nations have now signed up to cooperate with NATO in a way that gives us the opportunity, for the first time since nation states came across the European continent, to unify Europe rather than have it divided. So, I am quite encouraged, actually, about the way things are going. We are engaging Russia; we are engaging the other republics of the former Soviet Union. In Asia, the United States is engaging Japan, is engaging China, is engaging a whole lot of other Pacific powers in an attempt to preserve the peace there. In our own hemisphere now, 33 of the 35 nations in Central and Latin America are now governed by democracies. So, I think that we are trying to forge this newer world.

Why is it so difficult to do what Roosevelt did, to send some of those men to put the fire out in Europe? Well, first of all, Roosevelt sent those people after Pearl Harbor, after there was an attack and after Germany declared war on the United States, when the whole future of Europe was at stake. What has happened here is that European nations under the U.N. mandate have gone into Bosnia not for the purpose of ending the war but for the purpose of preserving the U.N. mission of preserving some limitation on the fighting and some humanitarian aid. We have acted in support of that in several ways. We have provided through our air power the longest humanitarian airlift in history, now longer than the Berlin airlift. We have worked hard to get our NATO allies to agree to use not only the threat but the reality of air power to stop the war in Bosnia from spreading to the air. We have shot down planes in aid of that objective to protect Sarajevo and other safe areas. And we are aggressively involved with our European allies in trying to get a peace agreement. I do not think it is an appropriate thing for the United States to send ground troops to Bosnia to become involved in the conflict itself. Now, if we reach an agreement in which NATO has a responsibility to enforce the agreement along lines agreed to by the parties, that is a different matter altogether. The United States still has troops in the Middle East enforcing the agreement reached by Israel and Egypt at the Camp David accord. If we are talking about limiting the conflict, we have troops now in Macedonia, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, designed to limit the conflict. I think that that is the appropriate thing for us. I think the Europeans have done the right thing in putting their troops in in the U.N. mandate to try to limit the fighting. But in the end, these parties are going to have to make an agreement. Otherwise, there is a risk that they will collapse the U.N. mission. They are going to have to decide that they cannot win, either side, by fighting and make an agreement. They reached an agreement tentatively before the terrible problems in Gorazde.

You raised the possibility of discussing lifting the trade embargo on the Serbs. You talked about lifting the arms embargo on the Muslims. In any event, you did not do any of those things. Can you see why your friends are perplexed by this because you seemed to have changed your mind? A lot of times people have said things in this Bosnian thing, not only about me but about others, as a way of shifting to others the responsibility they have for their own frustrations. Let us just be frank about this. I did not raise the prospect of any kind of unilateral lifting in the embargo on Serbia. I said that any discussion of that, any discussion of that, could not proceed until there was some sort of cessation of hostilities and that I personally would not favor changing the position of the United States, which is that that embargo should not be lifted until there is a peace agreement in force in Bosnia and some other changes have occurred in Serbia. I have not changed our position. With regard to lifting the arms embargo, I have always thought that the arms embargo was unfair to the Bosnian Government, always. That has been my position from day one. I have also always thought that the United States should not unilaterally lift it, from day one. Our European allies have not favored lifting it for good reasons. They have soldiers on the ground there. There are British soldiers in Bosnia; they do not want them subject to attack, to capture because the arm's embargo has been lifted. Therefore, I do not think the global community will vote to lift the arms embargo unless the U.N. mission collapses. What I said about the arms embargo was quite simple, and that is that I think it is a possibility if the U.N. mission does not succeed. I said what I did in hopes that we could spur the Serbs to understand that they are going to have to make a reasonable agreement or fight a very long war. I do not think any of that is inconsistent with the position I have taken. The problem is-let us face it, the problem is everybody is so frustrated about Bosnia that it is easy in our frustrations to point our fingers at each other.

Could we turn to Ireland now, ENTITY; that is been a bone of contention with Britain. Was your decision to allow Gerry Adams in here, in retrospect, a mistake because the IRA have still failed to endorse the Downing Street declaration on the peace process? The decision to let him come was plainly taking a risk for peace. I think that Sinn Fein ought to renounce violence and ought to join the peace process. I am very frankly pleased that at long last they issued their questions and the British Government provided answers and all that is been published. And I am hoping that after the June 12 elections, that we will see some real progress there.

I got to hear a little bit of your last conversation. ENTITY, are you going to get your tax bill and your budget bill through the Senate? Carl Levin is on this program a little bit later. We have already taped that segment. What do you think? It is not easy ever to make these kinds of tough decisions. There are $250 billion in budget cuts in that bill that affect everything from agriculture to veterans, to Medicare, to virtually all the specific programs in the Government. And this will bring the deficit down by $500 billion, and it will keep these long-term interest rates coming down, which is what is so necessary if we are going to have reinvestment in our country and rebuild the manufacturing sector and get this economy going again. And those who have tried to fashion other alternatives have come up with programs that hurt the vulnerable in our country and the middle class more and hurt the business economy more. And I think that is why we have had people from companies representing the automakers to high-tech companies in California supporting the program. It is a little-known thing that over half the 100 biggest companies in the country have supported the program, that the labor organizations have supported it, that the home builders organization, a largely Republican group, have supported it because it will bring interest rates down and create jobs and incomes for the American people. But if it does pass the Senate, and apparently Senator Levin feels you have enough votes, 50 or more votes, it has to go back to the House. It is been changed significantly from the bill approved by the House. We hear the Black Caucus may be falling out of step. Can it pass the entire Congress?

{"id": 3428, "text": "And they will try to take the best parts of both bills and come up with a bill which has more budget cuts than taxes, fair taxes, but still has some of the incentives we need for small business job creation, for the high-tech job creation, for empowerment zones to get private sector investment into the urban areas and to the poor rural areas, and also some of the money for Head Start education and training and for joint projects with the private sector for new technologies to help to deal with the defense cuts. And I expect it to pass both Houses. Like I said, these are difficult times, because for 12 years the American people have been told one thing and had another thing happen where the debt just kept getting bigger and bigger, and it is eating us alive. And interest rates were high, and we could not get investment. We could not get jobs. We are going to turn it around, but it is not easy. A couple of things started to leak out this weekend on those weekend Washington shows. One item was that entertainers and sports people, people who make big salaries for usually a relatively short period of time, would be exempt from the new higher rate of income tax. Apparently it was on Face the Nation or one of those shows yesterday. I think what you are going to find is that people who make a lot of money for just a couple of years may wind up doing something that many of them already do, by the way, which is structuring their contracts so they get paid over a longer period of years than they play. But I know of no exemptions for any high income people. And the surtax on the capital gains tax, everyone was figuring maybe there will be a capital gains cut. That is in the Senate bill. But I am not sure how it will come out in the end. I think one thing you can look forward to is a so-called venture capital gains on new business capital gains tax, where people who put their money into new businesses will be given big incentives to do so. That is, if you take a risk on somebody and you start a new venture and you hire some new people to create new jobs in the economy and you hold that investment for 5 years or more, you will be able to reduce your tax liability if, in fact, it turns out to be successful.

{"id": 3429, "text": "I asked this morning in my morning show-I mentioned, of course, that I would be talking to you. And I said, Give me some questions that you'd like me to ask ENTITY And I heard from several small business people. Look, I wanted to open two new businesses this year -this was a fellow who was in the fast-food franchise business, but he said, With all that is going on relative to the proposed new legislation on taxes, I am afraid to build any more restaurants. I heard that over and over this morning. Let me just mention two or three things that should be reassuring to small businesses. If these provisions of my plan pass, first of all, anybody who starts a new venture will be able to get investment for that new venture. And if the investment is held for 5 years or more, the tax rates will be much, much lower than the ordinary income tax rates, if it passes. Secondly, for ongoing small businesses, today the write-off for expensing on the tax form is $10,000 per year. We propose to raise that to $25,000. That will be a substantial reduction in the tax burden of most small businesses and will be an encouragement, I think, for them to hire more people. Thirdly, if someone has a chain of restaurants, for example, like the person who called in, in the plan that I presented to the Congress that the House of Representatives adopted, we have some changes in the alternative minimum tax provisions which operate as real incentives for people to continue to invest their profits in the expansion of their businesses without running up bigger tax bills. So I would urge the small business people who are listening to us to really look at what is in that House bill. There are a lot of very strong pro-business and pro-small business provisions in the bill that have not gotten a lot of attention. That is why, let me just mention, the National Realtors Association and the National Home Builders Association, two groups not normally associated with the Democratic Party, have already strongly endorsed this economic program because of the incentives for economic growth and because it is bringing down long-term interest rates. Any business person who has to borrow money in all probability is going to save more money in lower-interest rates than they will pay in higher taxes.

I mean, in 1981 we cut taxes and increased spending and nearly bankrupted this country over the next 12 years, and we have been paying for it ever since, so that we had very high long-term interest rates, and credit was expensive, and job generation was weak. That is a problem, by the way, for wealthy countries throughout the world. Even Japan's having trouble creating jobs now. But look what is happened since I announced my plan and it started to pass its way through Congress, just in the last 4 or 5 months. First, we have had 755,000 new jobs in this economy, over 90 percent of them in the private sector, in the first 4 months of this administration. In the previous 4 years, we only had a million jobs. Second, in construction, part of the economy very affected by interest rates, in the first 4 months we had 130,000 new jobs, that is the biggest increase in 9 years. Has that affected every State and every community yet? No, but it shows that we are really moving in the right direction. If we can get everybody in this country to refinance their home loans, their business loans, to take available credit because interest rates are lower, that will put tens of billions of dollars back into this economy to create jobs. What inflation rate, sir-I do not mean to interrupt you, but we are short on time-what inflation rate would you be happy with one year from now? But if we got unemployment down to a very low level and every American had a job, it might be a tad higher than it is now, but right now we think we are in good shape on inflation. What we need in America are more jobs and higher incomes, and that is what we are working on. How is David Gergen doing in his new job? Is the Washington press corps still braying at the moon, sir?

ENTITY, can you tell us yet what you think has been your most satisfying achievement and the most heartbreaking failure in your 8 years? You came into the office, I know, with many desires of what you could do. Well, I think possibly, that there will have to be more reflection on my part to give you truly a definitive answer. The big disappointment I felt is one not of a mere incident, it was the fact that we could not in these 8 years get to the place where we could say it now looks as if permanent peace with justice is really in sight. But, on the other hand, if you take achievement over the long run, let us remember what has happened in these 8 years. Our opponents achieved the nitrogen hydrogen bomb. They began to build up an arsenal which, of course, we know is many thousands of megatons in expressed power, in its power; and at the same time during those days we were already fighting one war, there was danger that there was going to be a spread of those hostilities. During the entire first 4 years, I think, the Red Chinese were constantly threatening war, saying they were and they were not only threatening, but often making moves in that direction and at the same time the Russians were saying, We are going to support our Red China allies. Now, there was I believe in this in the governmental actions of the 8 years, the kind of understanding and firmness and readiness to take the risk that prevented those things from happening because I am perfectly sure that weakness would have allowed them to, and a display of weakness, and I mean either moral or physical would have allowed them to spread this war to the great and disastrous consequences of all the earth. So, the achievement I think, one of the achievements has been that we actually have stopped many of these risks from becoming realities, and on the other hand the disappointment is that we have not done better in getting a more constructive and positive indication that real disarmament is around the corner. Now if you want, if you want a very particular incident, I'd say November 8th was one of another bad disappointments.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference216", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-216", "publication_date": "18-01-1961", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Dwight D.

Well, let us start, so I may not remember all your questions, I will start with the end of it. By Democratic friends of mine in the Congress it has been proposed to give me back my rank that I resigned in July of 1952 and that, of course, would be a satisfying thing to me simply because it was the 40 years that I put in the military service that would give me a title of my own rather than how do you say Mr. ex-President ? Now, as to what I want to do, I do want to explore my own mind and have a bit of perspective in looking at these 8 years rather than being in the midst of them and seeing whether I have anything that I think is worthwhile to providing for the public; and in doing that, I will possibly do some traveling.

Now, it is therefore a very tough problem to keep all of these things always on the same road going the same way. This would be the job of the First Secretary, as I see it, not that he takes the place of the President at all, in the foreign field, but to day by day watch what is going on in the world keep everybody in all the several departments aware of what they must do so as to have a completely coordinated policy.

Do you take the view that the economy is moving into a dangerous period that would require this additional governmental action, or do you feel that the proposals made may be extreme and not necessary? of course I am no while I am one of seven sons, I am not the seventh son of a seventh son, so I am not a prophet.

Well, because it is -first of all, the assumption is that when you give a comprehensive speech in the Far East, it would be in, you know, China or Japan or, you know-and Thailand is, one, a longtime friend; two, is an important part of ASEAN. In other words, there is -the Far East is more than just the countries that dominate the news. And so therefore, if you are going to give a comprehensive speech, you give it in a country that makes it-just by the sight alone, indicates how comprehensive the policy must be.

What are you doing or what can you do to get Senator Johnston's vote? And do you think you will ultimately get it? I do not know the answer to the last question, but what I have done is to try to take the strengths of both House and Senate versions of the bill and try to put them together. The strength of the Senate version was it had fewer overall taxes and was even more progressive. The strength of the House version was it had much more economic incentives, more economic growth incentives, for research and development, for investment in new firms, for small business, the things of that kind. So the argument that I am going to be making to all these Senators is that this plan now clearly has $500 billion in deficit reduction; it will now have more spending cuts than tax increases in it; it will have over 75 percent of the new tax burden now borne by people with incomes above $200,000; that the middle class tax burden is now down to $33 a year; and that the economic growth incentives qualifying, for example, 90 percent plus of the small businesses in the country for a reduction in taxes if they invest more in their companies; and enabling the working poor through the earned-income tax credit to lift themselves above poverty by working full time The people who are leaning against this program or have announced against it-not the Republicans, that is almost entirely a political deal; the Republicans have even opposed the conservative amendments to our budget to control entitlements and impose discipline. There are those who think it is the right thing for the country, but they are afraid there is been so much misinformation out there about it that they will get beat if they vote for it. The only thing I would say to the latter group is that we do have to do something on entitlements, but we cannot get there until we do something to reform health care spending overall, and that this is a major step that will stabilize the financial markets, keep interest rates down, and enable us to move on to health care reform, to getting a world trade agreement, to welfare reform, to the crime bill, to all these things that are out there crying for attention that we cannot even address if we do not go ahead and get this budget out of the way.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnewspapereditors0", "title": "Interview With Newspaper Editors", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-newspaper-editors-0", "publication_date": "02-08-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

And the House of Representatives has already cut another $10 billion off the budget that we cannot fully count yet because the Senate has not acted. But when they do, we will have even more cuts. Let me pass on to you a question I am getting increasingly from Constitution readers. How can you assure that your tax increase package does not have the same result as Mr. Bush's 1990 tax increase package, which is to say no result at all except higher taxes? I can do that in two ways. First of all, let us look at what happened in 1990. Why did the deficit reduction package in 1990 not produce the deficit reduction it was intended to? But one big reason is that they overestimated how much the revenues would bring in; that is, they had some very, very liberal revenue estimates, and those revenues did not materialize. So that within 60 days after the package passed, they revised downward the amount of deficit reduction by $130 billion. Now, we have instead taken the most conservative revenue estimates we could get. The second thing is that I have pledged to the Congress that by Executive order, I will put all of this money, the spending cuts and the revenue increases, into a trust fund and that every year if we miss the deficit reduction target, I will come forward to the Congress and give them a plan to meet the target, that is, to have further cuts to meet the target, and ask them to vote on it. I might say that we had those requirements in the law, and through the parliamentary rules of the Senate, the Republicans took it out of the law. One hundred percent of the Republicans agree with that budgetary discipline, and they took it out because they thought it was good politics for them to take it out and weaken the bill further. So I am going to do it by Executive order. Now, let me say, there was one other thing different from 1990. Because this plan has been taken much more seriously by the financial markets, it has already had a big impact in bringing down long-term interest rates, and that has led millions of people to refinance their homes and their business loans. And I am convinced once we actually pass the plan, we will release a lot of investment into the economy.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnewspapereditors0", "title": "Interview With Newspaper Editors", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-newspaper-editors-0", "publication_date": "02-08-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

So there are a lot of pro-growth incentives in this plan that were not there in 1990, and those are the principal differences. Ross Perot is saying that this proposal should be rejected so Members of Congress can go back home, visit with their constituents, get a better feel for the spending cuts that would be accepted, come back in September and cut some more. Well, because we have already got more spending cuts than revenue increases, number one; because we are going to keep cutting spending, as I have said. But no one who looks at this budget deficit believes it can seriously be brought under control unless there are some revenue increases. And you know, I think it is pretty funny-I mean, I have got a 4.3 cent gas tax in my plan. Ross Perot proposed a dime a year for 5 years or a 50 cent gas tax increase in his plan, something he was running from yesterday on television. I have more verifiable spending cuts than he proposed in his plan. We have done what we need to do here to get a budget out. Nothing precludes us from cutting more spending. We are going to cut more spending. But until we pass this budget, we are paralyzed from going on to the next big problem with the deficit, which is health care costs and entitlements there. And that is got to be dealt with in the context of health care reform. We cannot get to health care reform; we cannot consider the next big round of spending cuts through reinventing Government; we cannot do the crime bill, which is very, very important; we cannot do welfare reform; we cannot do anything until we pass a budget. And we have debated this from February to August. There will be more spending cuts in every year I am here. But the time has come to pass this budget and get on with it. Spending cuts now will exceed the tax increases. And we are going to put it all against the deficit. And we have just got to do this so we can go on and do the rest of it.

I have got a plan, and it'll work, and I want to pass it. And it is good for the country. We had 67 business executives here from big and small companies last week, 4 energy company executives-half of them were Republicans, one of them was President Bush's cochairman-supporting this plan.

I mean, there is very broad support for this program among people who really understand it. When I went to Tokyo to meet with the leaders of other industrial nations at the G-7 summit, for 10 years the statement coming out of that meeting had criticized the United States for its budget deficit. For the first time in 10 years, they complimented the United States. And they agree with me that we ought to go and try to get the 111 countries that are in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to lower tariffs on a whole range of issues, eliminate them on a lot of other products. And everybody concedes, who is studied this, that this could add hundreds of thousands of jobs to the American manufacturing sector this year. Because we are doing something about our deficit. We do not need to delay this another month or 2 months or 3 months. That is what they did in 1990, by the way. One of your questions was what did not work in 1990.

Sir, there is been a good bit of discussion about the timing of the spending cuts, particularly saying that they mostly come in the later years. Could you please comment on the timing of the spending cuts? Well, they were not timed to do that. The fact is that we have more control- when I took over this budget-these budgets are done on a 5-year cycle. If you are going to make deep cuts, it is easier to plan for them if you have a little time to plan for them. And also under the previous budget that we inherited, the budgets were already tighter in the early years, and they were much looser, I thought, in the later years. But I assure you, we are not waiting for that. I have already given instructions to my Cabinet to prepare more budget cuts for the coming year. We have reduced the deficit in this year since I have been in office, mostly because of lower interest rates, by about $25 billion over and above where it was projected to be. So there are budget cuts in the early years, but it is like planning anything else. If you are going to take big whacks out of a large organization, the longer time goes on, the more you have to plan, the bigger the cuts you can make. Now, let me say one other thing. Other people talk about cut first and tax later; most of their cuts are in the later years, too. They just want to pass them first and then avoid the tough decisions on the taxes. But if you look at the cuts that are proposed by others, if you look at Senator Boren's cuts on entitlements, almost all of them come in the later years, the meaningful ones. That is where they come, except the proposals that would have raised the costs of health care to middle class Medicare recipients or upper class ones. I am not against, for example, raising the premiums on Part B. That is what he called a spending cut.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnewspapereditors0", "title": "Interview With Newspaper Editors", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-newspaper-editors-0", "publication_date": "02-08-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 3448, "text": "But if you are going to do it, it ought to be done in the context of overall health care reform and not just trying to get more money from those folks. I think we need to reform the health care system. The people who talk about spending cuts first are basically saying this. We are cutting defense sharply and about all we can. I am concerned that we should not do more. We have cut it quite deeply. For example, that means every dollar we increase Head Start, every dollar we increase education and training for workers that have been displaced by defense plants closing down, every dollar we put into new technologies for defense conversion-those are the three areas where we basically have increased-we have to cut in veterans affairs, in agriculture, in all these other areas. Already we have a budget that will reduce the Federal work force by over 100,000 people in the next 5 years, and there will be more cuts coming to that, so that is flat. The only thing that is increasing in this budget are the so-called entitlements, and that is basically Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security cost of living. We have restrained Federal pay increases and Federal pension increases below where they have been under the previous administrations. They are getting some cost of living, but less than they ordinarily would, and I called for a freeze in the first year. So the real growth is in Medicare and Medicaid, in the health care programs. If you put a lid on them now without reforming the health care system, you must do one of two things that I think are not good. One is to charge middle class elderly people more for their Medicare and much more if you are going to make them pay it all. Or the second is to not charge them any more, just limit how much the Federal Government pays, and force the doctors and hospitals to shift all the costs to the private sector, which would raise the health insurance premiums of every newspaper on this telephone. That is what is been going on for years. I do not dispute those who say if you want to take the deficit from where I take it to down to zero, you have to deal with entitlements. And it will require more spending cuts, not more tax increases beyond where we are. I agree with that. But my point is you do not get to that until you do this first.

And if push comes to shove, how would you put them in priority of importance if you have to keep one and get rid of one? Well, let me just say this. They are both very important to me for different reasons. And I think they are both important to the country. I think, if you are asking how they are doing now, I think the space station is more secure than the super collider, because the space station passed a House vote. The second time we got some more votes. But the first time we only carried it by a couple of votes when two good friends of mine who went down to vote against it stayed to the end and changed their vote so we could save it because they knew it was important to me and, I think, to the country, as I said. So we have redesigned the space station after a serious review by an eminent team of national scientists. It is very important to maintain our leadership in space technology. It is very important in terms of new partnerships with Russia to keep them involved in this kind of technology, to reduce the incentive they have to sell weapons and keep them taking their nuclear force down. But most important, it is a big economic boom to us. If we get out of this, the Europeans will move right in, take this over, and have a lot of those high-wage jobs that Americans should have. The super collider is important, in my judgment, for science and for research, not so much for applied technology now. We do not know for sure what it will produce, but we know that it has the potential to produce a great deal, and we know that other major science research projects like this have often had unintended benefits. It is in more trouble now. And frankly, whether we can save it or not depends entirely on whether we can save it in the Senate. I think then-Senator Bentsen clearly saved it in the Senate last time. It got beat by 70 more votes in the House this time than it did last year.

I do not know whether that had anything to do with it or not, but I know it lost by 70 more votes than it did last year. And you know, it is pretty tense in the Senate now over a lot of these issues. But I am strongly supporting it. I am going to do what I can to pass it, and I think we have got a chance to pass it. The key to passing it, frankly, is asking the Senate to look at the national interest and look at the fact that we have to make a significant investment in nondefense research and development and technology. Now that we have cut defense a great deal and we have not offset all the cuts in technology with domestic investments in technology, and that is where a lot of these high wage jobs of the future come from, we cannot permit this to become a debate where the people in California took 40 percent of the base closing cuts last time and they complained that Texas took no cuts and that they are voting for new revenues and the Texas Senators want- I mean, if it becomes a deal, you know, a Stateby-State deal, I think it is gone. The only way we can save it is if people will recognize that it is in the national interest to do so. I am hoping we can do it. I cannot believe all these editorial writers do not have another question. You spoke about now having more spending cuts than tax increases. I wonder if you could give us the figures, the current state of affairs. It could change, but the last time I talked to Senator Mitchell it was about $254 billion in spending cuts and about $242 billion or $241 in taxes, or something like that. They were at about $496 billion. And like I said, it could change in the next few days, but- I mean in the next day or so.

But let me say, without identifying anybody, if you look at the people who have opposed the program or the people who voted for it with reluctance, their basic objections break down into two categories. I think this is the right thing to do for the country, and I hope it passes, but I am scared I will get beat if I vote for it. first of all, by recreating an aggressive communications strategy, more like what we did in the campaign, to try to combat what we think are false claims against this plan and just to get the information out about it; and secondly, to ask everybody to imagine what it is going to be like, not the day after the vote but after we have had a chance to continue our spending cut program through the Vice President's reinventing Government initiative and through other cuts that will come when we have got a chance to deal with health care and welfare reform and the crime bill and these other issues.

Senator Nunn, for example-we have got the Atlanta Journal on here- Senator Nunn is sort of in that category, you know, said you have got to deal with entitlement costs, too. And my argument to that group of people-and that is the argument that Senator Boren made yesterday-is that you are right, it does not do enough. But that is not a good reason to vote against this because what it does is very good, indeed. And unless you do this, you cannot get to the second stage. That is, I completely agree we have to control entitlement costs and that that begins overwhelmingly with Medicare and Medicaid costs. I just do not think it is fair or right to do it unless it is part of an overall health care reform plan which brings down the cost of health care to all Americans and stops cost-shifting and does not impose unfair burdens on elderly people on Medicare.

ENTITY, since you brought up health care reform, what do you say to reassure Americans-looming over this budget package with its various tax increases is the specter of more increases to pay for health care. How can you reassure Americans that they are not getting ready to get hit by a one-two punch? First of all, I think we tried to be pretty clear from the beginning that a cigarette tax was just about the only thing we had under consideration to deal with the Government's part of this responsibility, which is how to provide health care for the unemployed uninsured. Now, the other big question that the small business community raised is what is going to happen to the employed uninsured, virtually all of whom work for small businesses. And I do not , myself, think that it is right to raise everybody else's taxes to cover those people because everybody else is paying too much already. I do think that if we are going to join the ranks of every other advanced country in the world and we are going to bring our costs down, we have got to cover everybody. An employer should bear some responsibility for their employees. And the employee should bear some responsibility, too. But my own view of that is that the best way to do that is to limit the ultimate cost to small business and phase any new requirements in over a period of years so that nobody is adversely affected too much.

But if you as you were saying, you always had the legal authority to stop deportations, then why did you deport two million people? For six years you did it. You destroyed many families. They called you deporter-in-chief. You called me deporter-in-chief. It was Janet Murguia from La Raza.  Well, you could have stopped deportations. Listen, here is the fact of the matter. You could have stopped them. ENTITY, here is the fact of the matter. As ENTITY I am always responsible for problems that are not solved right away. I regret millions of people who did not get health insurance before I passed health insurance and before I implemented it. I regret the fact that there are kids who should've been going to college during my presidency, but because we did not get to them fast enough, they gave up on college. The question is, are we doing the right thing, and have we consistently tried to move this country in a better direction.

We spent that entire time trying to get a comprehensive immigration reform bill done that would solve the problem for all the people. So right now, by the actions that I have taken, I still have five million people who do not have the ability to get registered and be confident that they are not deported. In fact, what is going to happen, sometime over the next two days, week, month is that that they are going to be some folks who are still caught up in the system because we have to go and train ICE workers so that they are responding in a different way. And so the question I have for you, ENTITY, because you are going to have a big voice, is are you going to do a good job in, now that we have taken these actions, making sure that people understand what their opportunities are, how we can take advantage of it, and how we can build to make sure that going forward, not only as many people register as possible, if you have been here for five years, if you have a child who is an American citizen or a legal permanent resident, that you are likely to end up signing up so that we build up that capacity, and we lay the groundwork for passing comprehensive immigration reform. Because if we do not do that, then it is true that there are going to be a whole bunch of folks who try to push back, and this is necessarily a temporary measure designed to help as many people as we can right now, but we have still got a big fight that we are going to have to take in the future.  and I'd be happy to do it, but you are probably running out of time. We are, right, yeah, so I have like two or three minutes. So let me just go with another issue.

Just first observation is that we have worked hard to build up good bilateral relations in the Far East. And the-part of the purpose of the trip is to continue to foster those relations. It struck me as interesting that the United States now has got good enough relations with both-with countries like Japan and South Korea and China to effect policy which helps our mutual security and our economy-and economy. The most notable example of where that is taking-where it is helping is in North Korea. When I visited with Hu Jintao, I spent a lot of time talking about North Korea, our mutual desire to effect change with Kim Chong-il. But I also had the very same discussion with Koizumi and President Roh. I mentioned it to Vladimir. I did not have a bilateral with Vladimir Putin, but I did talk to him about it in passing. My point is, is that by working hard to establish good relations on a lot of fronts, when a common problem arises, we can effect the solution in a positive way. I know you asked me, Steve , about the North Korean reaction. I did not exactly see what official said it. But I-what I hope my answer conveyed to you in public there was that this requires a degree of patience, because Kim Chong-il is used to being able to deal bilaterally with the United States. But the change of policy now is, is that he must deal with other nations, most notably China. And I was pleased with my discussions with Hu Jintao, about his-reaffirming his mutual desire-or his desire, which is our mutual goal, that Kim Chong-il disarm. We discussed the security guarantees, what form they may come in. I made it very clear, obviously-I said this during the pool spray there-that a treaty is not going to happen, but there are other ways to effect on paper what I have said publicly- we have no intention of invading. Obviously, any guarantee would be conditional on Kim Chong-il doing what he hopefully will say he will do, which is to get rid of his nuclear weapons programs.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresspool0", "title": "Interview With Members of the White House Press Pool", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-members-the-white-house-press-pool-0", "publication_date": "22-10-2003", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["George W.

This was really one of the first official meetings of a group of countries after the Cancun talks broke down. And there was a positive statement coming out of the meeting, kind of universal agreement that Cancun was a missed opportunity. Hopefully the missed opportunity will be-will serve as a catalyst. I think people now have taken a step back and said, Well, we did miss an opportunity, and hopefully this will enable the talks-kind of not start at ground zero but have a running start as a result of the missed opportunity. And it is interesting, in the room there is something like 60 percent of all the world trade-was affected-was countries in that room, and therefore it was a, I think, a very positive and strong statement. The other thing was the clear understanding of the countries of the need to fight terror. That is important for the United States, that people continue to recognize that the war on terror goes on. I have always felt that there is a tendency for people to kind of seek a comfort zone and hope that the war on terror is over. And I view it as a responsibility of the United States to remind people of our mutual obligations to deal with the terrorists. That notion of responsible behavior by countries was finally accepted. This was not a-did not require a lot of push. President Megawati understands that when terrorists bomb Bali, it affects economies. It not only-there is a serious economic consequence, same thing we felt on September the 11th, to our economy. Bilateral discussion with all the leaders- in those bilateral discussions, we talked about this war on terror. Gloria Arroyo, with Abu Sayyaf, President Megawati just hours ago, we talked about the continued need for us to work together. I think the other notable-when you step back and take a look at what our work with these Asian countries has been, they understand the Iraq issue well.

We had some good discussions there at APEC, but this will be a chance to further our discussions and assure the Australian people that the American people are really grateful for the support and mutual efforts to make the world secure. I had a good visit with the religious leaders today. And one of the reasons I wanted to have this meeting was because I wanted to make it very clear that I did not feel that way and Americans do not feel that way.

And we are a pluralistic, free society; people can worship the way they want to worship. And it works well in America. Did they come out with the line about- what did they tell you? They said some things going into the meeting that the United States policy is tilted against Muslims. They said the United States policy is tilted toward Israel, and I said our policy is tilted toward peace and that-and then I went through the notion of a Palestinian state and the need for us to fight off terror in order for a state to develop. There were five people there that felt-that all needed to say something. So I gave them all a time to speak, and I listened and would occasionally interject some thoughts about what they had said.

And I reminded him that the world had spoken before, that there was a-the United States had passed-I did not get into all the resolutions, but I made it clear that a process had gone on way before I made the decision to use military force, that the world had spoken before about Saddam Hussein. I also made the point very clearly that there was a lot of human suffering; a lot of Muslims suffered in And I did bring up the mass graves and the torture rooms and the rape rooms and the death at the hands of Saddam Hussein. My point to them was, was that we ended a lot of suffering, prevented a lot of suffering.

We need an economic development package that will help the Palestinians realize a hopeful future. But we cannot do so until there is the institutions of a credible state in place. In other words, we are not going to give money if it ends up going into somebody's pockets and not to help the people we are trying to help. So we have got the framework. We have got the vision for peace and the framework for getting there, and now we have just got to continue working together to achieve it.

I want to make some news with you. I will make some news for you today. Yes, sir, that would be great--because, you know, Koreans get upset over this island because whenever the Japanese mention that-you know, it is like the Japanese expansionism in the region and so on. Are you ready for some news? I am ready for some news, please. First of all, this dispute will be settled by Japan and South Korea.

Well, look, part of my- one of the reasons why it is very important for the United States to have an active presence and to establish good bilateral relations with the countries in the region is to help foster good relations between countries, whether it be South Korea and Japan, or Japan and China; it is essential. And it is in our national interest that South Korea have good relations with Japan. I listen very carefully to the respected leaders. But first of all, we cannot fix certain disputes; that will be up to the sovereign governments. But we can help facilitate dialogue. We can help facilitate understandings. And so I think it is very important for the United States to be very active and have a good, solid presence and have vibrant diplomacy, which is what this administration has had. Part of the reason that I am stopping in South Korea prior to going to the Olympics-I mean, one could have attempted just to go straight to the Olympics, but I want to come to South Korea-I had just come from Japan, and it is all part of making sure that our foreign policy is active. I would hope that no President would ever dial us out of the Far East. Quite the contrary, I think it is very important for us to stay actively engaged in the Far East. And one such multilateral engagement is the six-party talks, all aimed at keeping- dealing with a very delicate issue, but with five partners sending the same message to your neighbor to the north. So it is part of a foreign policy vision that is multilateral in nature, with strong bilateral relations that help create an atmosphere in which old grievances and new issues can be solved in a peaceful way. Are you going to deliver the FTA message to Koreans? Went to a meeting of the South Korean-U.S. Business Alliance for a reason, I went in there to make it clear that this administration absolutely thinks it is essential that Congress pass the Korean FTA. And I will deliver it again because I know the President is concerned about whether or not-you know, he hears talk out of the Congress, and I will assure him that this free trade agreement is in our interest, in South Korea's interest, and that we want to get it done.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists4", "title": "George W.

Just-in two parts-some would argue that during your Presidency, you know, obviously the U.S. is focused on the war on terror-Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq-and that meant probably in the views of some that the U.S. was less engaged in Asia, especially vis-a-vis countering the influence of China, which has grown, and that basically your foreign policy has been pretty much like previous administrations, which lacked more higher level of proactive stance; some compared it to the Shultz period. How would you describe your legacy under your Presidency for Asia and U.S.-ASEAN relations? And point number two, looking ahead with the changes happening with India growing stronger, China growing stronger, that is going to change the dynamics of the region and the U.S. is a global player in the world. How do you see U.S. role in that region in the future? Let me start with the second, then you can refresh my 62-year-old memory for the first. There is plenty of room for countries to work with-the three countries you mentioned with other countries in the region in a constructive way. In other words, I do not view the diplomacy as zero sum, it is got to be either this country or that country. India and China and the United States will provide great opportunities for entrepreneurs, businesses throughout the region. And they will provide great opportunities for development of services and goods that people in our big markets want. It provides great opportunities for capital flows that are-foreign direct investment, which is necessary for economic development. It will provide opportunities to work collaboratively on strong strategic areas, security areas. One area will be-there is a great opportunity for all of us to cooperate on the environment. So I view the emergence of India and China as positives. I think it is going to be very important for the United States to stay engaged, not only with the two nations. If I were Thailand, I'd be asking, What about us. Will you remember other nations? And one way to do that-the reason I brought up multilateralism is one way to stay engaged is through the mechanisms like the six-party talks on the Korean issue.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists4", "title": "George W.

ASEAN is a place where the United States can remain-should remain actively engaged with nations who are saying-say, Wait a minute, we are your friends, as well. APEC is another very important group of nations where we can work in a way that is beneficial, mutually beneficial. I have gone to every APEC meeting, including the one right after September the 11th, 2001; I am going to this one, even after our elections. I will be semiretired by the time I--I will be still sprinting, but semiretired. And in terms of foreign policy in the Far East, it is mistaken if someone were to say that my preoccupation was on the war on terror. You bet I wanted to make sure that we protected ourselves at home. Secondly, our foreign policy has been robust in the Far East. Our relations with your country, with South Korea, with Japan, and with China have never been better. And it took a lot of work to get relations, bilateral relations, as strong as they are. Not many Presidents could say, in the history of U.S. diplomacy, that relations with South Korea, Japan, China, and Thailand are strong and robust. A lot of times, if you are friends with one, you made it hard to be friends with another. So as a result of a lot of work, a lot of personal diplomacy, as well as a lot of active engagement throughout our administration, I can tell you that I am satisfied with the variety of relationships. Secondly, we have worked on common problems together. Who would have ever thought that Japan would have forces in Iraq, or South Korea would be alongside a lot of other nations in Afghanistan? My only point to you is, is that-or the Taiwan-Chinese relationship and that issue. It is a very sensitive issue for the Chinese Government. And people who study this very closely will see that the issue is in a better place.

Two new Embassies open the same year obviously to celebrate the 30th anniversary of what has been a very important relationship. It will be at that Embassy opening that I will be joined by my father, who first introduced me to China in 1975. I went to visit him-- And so I spent my time riding a bicycle around Beijing.

I mean, we will let the historians evaluate the difference between what the relationship was like in the eighties, nineties, but I can tell you how-my view. One, I have had good relations with-good personal relations with Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. Secondly, we have worked hard during my time to put strategic dialogues in place that broaden and enhance the relationship. So Secretary Paulson has worked with his two counterparts to deal with economic issues that are-it is very important. It is very important for us; it is very important for other nations in the region, by the way. And you know, we are working the currency issue or trade issues or international property rights-or intellectual property rights, I mean.

Looking ahead, do you think it is important for the American people to sort of view China mostly as a strategic competitor or more as a partner? I would call it a-I would-I think as we look ahead I would view it as a management of a complex relationship, where sometimes our national interests are aligned and sometimes our national interests are not aligned. They could-and let me just talk about the economy, for example. And one reason I call it a complex relationship is that here in America, trade with China is not necessarily universally accepted as good. It is universally accepted as good in this administration. I mean, free and fair trade is good for the world, and I believe it is good for this relationship. But it is a-some in America view the advent of Chinese manufacturing, particularly at the lower end of the economic scale, as direct competition with their own livelihood, thereby making the relationship complex. Energy-what is very interesting is that if you view China as a market, you want them to become more robust and more prosperous. But in order to do that, China is going to have to have more energy, and as China demands more energy, it creates more global demand relative to a slower growing supply, means higher prices for us all. It is a very interesting and important relationship made complex by globalization, and their constantly changing internal situation, particularly when it comes their economy. I am sure you have been reading about the Doha discussions. On the one hand, we have got very good relations. On the other hand, it was hard to find common ground to get the Doha deal closed. So it is hard to label the relationship one way or the other. An American President is going to have to pay very close attention to relations with not only China, but the region. And I say the region because if it ever-if the perception is ever that the United States is fixated only on China, then you are going to have issues with long-time allies, people that have been counting on the American support for a period of time.

And I believe I will be leaving office with the Far East in as good as shape as it can be from a U.S. perspective. I understand it is a headache and you are sprinting as fast as you can, but the North Koreans does not seem like they are keeping up with the pace. So maybe you could give me some more breaking news on this end. Sprinting is one thing; undermining good policy is another. And multilateral diplomacy is the best way to peacefully solve an issue such as the nuclearization or the weaponization or the desire to have a nuclear weapon program by the North Koreans. I will do nothing to undermine the six-party structure, the credibility of the six-party structure, and our partners. And therefore, to answer your question, we are very clear that in order to move forward in the phase that we are now in- and this is a phased-in deal-that there must be verification that we are all happy with, a verification mechanism on not only plutonium, but also highly enriched uranium, as well as proliferation. And we will obviously consult very closely with our partners. This will be a subject of discussion with the President. As you know, I am a believer in human dignity and human rights. I discuss it with all leaders. And I am-for example, when it comes to China, we have constantly asked China not to send people back into North Korea. I want to thank the South Korean people for welcoming their brothers and sisters who have been able to escape. It is what they need to do. We thank you for-- We need to open up-we have opened up our doors. And the first step-the two things on my mind now in North Korea are getting rid of the nuclear weapons program, which, as you know, can be very destabilizing. When North Korea fires rockets or tests, it creates reverberations around the immediate area. And secondly, is to recognize-constantly keep in mind the human rights violations that take place there.

I think-I do not think-matter of fact, I think our relations are very strong. I think they have been strong on counterterrorism and the economy. There is a difference about how hard people should push for democracy in Burma. I am at one end of the ledger. And I do want to thank the Thai Government for its understanding of the refugee issue, particularly as relates to the border policy. My message is going to be one directed to the people in Burma when I meet with some of the activists, and Laura is going to be meeting with some of the people that she got to know. I included Burma in my last United Nations address, and it was a pretty strong statement. And she was in the audience there at the U.N.

Well, continuing to talk about the leaders, the Chinese leaders, what has surprised you about your dealings over the last 8 years with Chinese leadership? One thing that interests me is to watch China's leaders deal with the benefits and challenges of a marketplace. In other words, this is a country that has got a lot of mouths to feed and a lot of people to employ. And they are committed to, in many ways, marketplace principles, particularly as they have invited in foreign capital. And it is been interesting to watch them deal with a combination of the need for raw material versus the-from the foreign policy implications of dealing with a country that has a lot of raw material. The classic case is Iran, where I have spent a lot of time with the Chinese President talking about the dangers of Iran having a nuclear weapon, knowing full well that they need fuel in order to meet their own internal pressures. Hu Jintao has been very open in many ways about his concerns and the pressures he feels, as have I. And by the way, that is not easy when there is a language barrier. And yet I can report to you that we do have cordial, relaxed conversations in spite of the fact that we both have interpreters. It is much easier when you are dealing with a person that speaks your own language. Since the only one I speak is English, it is important to have English speakers. But here is a man who I have had some-I feel comfortable talking about his family, and he asks about mine. And that may sound trite to you, but nevertheless, it is a part of getting comfortable with each other. So I guess what is interesting is to- just understanding the tensions that an emerging economy can feel, and particularly given Chinese-the Chinese role in international affairs, for example, their presence in the U.N. Security Council, Perm 5, which creates interesting tensions. I would say that there is been a-it is just been interesting to watch, and interesting to participate with people. I mean, the Taiwan issue was a very touchy issue for a while, causing me to say in the Oval Office-that which is now well-chronicled- that the United States does not support a unilateral declaration of independence.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists4", "title": "George W.

You are in the State ostensibly to help Harris Wofford win election to a full term. He replaced John Heinz in a special election a couple of years ago, and he went to Washington on the matter of national health care, which we all know did not make it through the Congress this year. Polls have shown overall that the Democrats are not going to do that well in the election, come one week from tomorrow on the 8th. What is the reason for that? Why is it voters look so poorly on your party and its candidates right now? There is a lag time between when you accomplish something in Washington and when people feel it in their own lives. There are still a lot of voters who have jobs, but they are worried about whether they will lose them or they will lose their health care or will they ever get a raise. It is a tough, fast-changing global economy, and a lot of people feel personally insecure. There are also a lot of people who are worried about crime and social breakdown. The other big problem is, when Congress is meeting and the Republicans are trying to kill everything, delay everything, talk everything to death, all of the focus is on conflict, process, failure. Now when the Congress has gone home for the last 2 or 3 weeks, you can sense a real movement out there. People sense that they have got a real fundamental choice here. If you look at Pennsylvania-you heard the quote there- we have had 86,000 new jobs in Pennsylvania. We have done things that the Congress had refused to address for years and years. We passed the family leave law to protect working people who have to take time off. We passed a law to expand Head Start, one to immunize children, one to give tax cuts for working families on modest incomes that have children in the home so they will never be in poverty. We are making the Government work for ordinary people again. And we have expanded trade and promoted peace and security around the world.

I just do not think the American people want that, and I do not think the people of Pennsylvania do. In recent polls-you keep talking about the recovery that is occurring, and I have no doubt that there is a recovery in certain parts of the country if they just bear that out. Here in the Northeast, however, there is no recovery; at least the perception is there is no recovery. There was a recent poll out by the Tarrence group that shows that only a third of Americans believe the claims of a recovery. My whole point to you, or my question to you is, why is it that this is the perception? It cannot simply be because Republicans are trying to stonewall things in the Congress so there is gridlock? No, I think-well, I do believe that people have not gotten a lot of the information; I think that is true. But I think-keep in mind what I said first. I think a lot of people may hear that there are more jobs, but they may feel that their personal situation is not more secure. That is, they may think, Well, I am still not going to get a raise, or I might lose my job, or I might lose my health benefits. Another million Americans lost their health care last year. That is why Harris Wofford and I worked so hard to protect the health care benefits of working people and to try to change the law so that they would not lose their health care. But the point I am trying to make to the American people is that we are making them more secure-that is what the family leave law was all about, that is what these efforts to improve the health of our children are all about, that is what the crime bill is all about-that our economic policy is working. So the issue is, do you want to keep working for something that is plainly taking us in the right direction, or do you want to buy this Republican snake oil, you know, We are going to give everybody a tax cut and balance the budget and increase everybody's spending, and we will tell you how we are going to pay for that after the election.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithdonlancerkywradiophiladelphia", "title": "Interview With Don Lancer of KYW Radio, Philadelphia", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-don-lancer-kyw-radio-philadelphia", "publication_date": "31-10-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Well, your unemployment rate in Pennsylvania is above the national average, but it is a point lower than it was when I took office. You lost 8,300 jobs in the previous administration; you got 86,800 more under our administration. They had 12 years; we have had 21 months. You want to turn around and give the guys that put you in the hole in the first place 2 more years, 4 more years, 6 more years? You gave them 12 years. We have been given 21 months, and we have turned it around. Now, just because everybody has not felt it, that is not a good reason to stay home or vote Republican. They had 12 years, and we were in a big hole. We also had 20 years, through both parties, of stagnant wages and less secure jobs and losing benefits. And we have had 30 years of rising crime and family breakdown. We are at least addressing all these things for the first time. And it is pretty refreshing, I think, to have a Government that has taken on the tough problems instead of running away from them and that can at least show we are making some progress. And the worst thing in the world you can do is to say, Okay, we gave you these problems-we had 12 years of the other party's politics and economics, we have got 20 years of economic problems and 30 years of social problems-and we have not felt anything in 21 months. So we are going to go back to the people that got us in the hole in the first place. If everybody will just relax and look at the record, they will vote for Harris Wofford, they will vote for Mark Singel, and they will vote to keep this country moving in the right direction so that all of Pennsylvania can feel the results of these efforts. But there have been changes in the way that those figures are tallied. If we were living under the same figures the Republicans had, the unemployment rate would have gone down over 1 1/2 percent.

The Soviet Union has emerged as a major nuclear threat. The country is very worried at this point in the 1950s. But Eisenhower is convinced that they are not that strong, that the United States is stronger, that the U.S. will win if we just avoid a huge war. And he decides to try to reassure the public, gives a series of speeches, saying keep your chin up, everything's fine, our strategy is working. The public does not believe him. He is accused of a failure of leadership, and his approval rating goes down. Are you going through the same experience now with regard to ISIS? Well, I tell you, first of all, I was not the Supreme Allied Commander helping to defeat Hitler, so he had a little credibility that he was working with. ISIS is a virulent, nasty organization that has gained a foothold in ungoverned spaces effectively in Syria and parts of western Iraq. We have to take it seriously. They have shown in Paris what they can do in an organized fashion, and in San Bernardino what we have seen is their ability to proselytize for their perverted brand of Islam and spur small-scale terrorist attacks. We are pounding ISIL's core structure in Syria and Iraq. We have put together a coalition that is increasingly effective. We have seen ISIL lose about 40 percent of its populated territory in the region, and both in terms of homeland security and in terms of our efforts over there, I am confident that we are going to prevail. But it is also important for us to keep things in perspective, and this is not an organization that can destroy the United States. This is not a huge industrial power that can pose great risks to us institutionally or in a systematic way. But they can hurt us, and they can hurt our people and our families. The most damage they can do, though, is if they start changing how we live and what our values are, and part of my message over the next 14 months or 13 months that I remain in office is to just make sure that we remember who we are and make sure that our resilience, our values, our unity are maintained.

{"id": 3517, "text": "And I say that simply because, according to polls, you do not have very much approval for it. Well, I think what is fair is that post-Paris you had a saturation of news about the horrible attack there. And ISIL combines viciousness with very savvy media operations. And as a consequence, if you have been watching television for the last month, all you have been seeing, all you have been hearing about is these guys with masks or black flags who are potentially coming to get you. And so I understand why people are concerned about it, and this is a serious situation, but what is important is for people to recognize that the power, the strength of the United States and its allies are not threatened by an organization like this; in the same way that al-Qaida was able to carry out one spectacular attack we ended up making some significant changes to harden homeland defenses. It then took awhile for us to ultimately snuff out core al-Qaida in the FATA, and there are still lingering remnants, but at no point was there ever a sense that in fact it could do catastrophic damage to us. You referred to ISIL's sophisticated media operation and also referred to what Americans are seeing in the American media. Are you suggesting that the media are being played in a sense here? Look, the media is pursuing ratings. I think that, you know, it is up to the media to make a determination about how they want to cover things. There is no doubt that the actions of ISIL are designed to amplify their power and the threat that they pose. That helps them recruit, that adds in the twisted thoughts of some young person that they might want to have carry out an action, that somehow they are part of a larger movement. And so I think that the American people absorb that, understandably are of concern. Now on our side, I think that there is a legitimate criticism of what I have been doing and our administration has been doing in the sense that we have not , you know, on a regular basis I think described all the work that we have been doing for more than a year now to defeat ISIL.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio2", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-2", "publication_date": "21-12-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 3518, "text": "And so if people have not seen the fact that in fact 9,000 strikes have been carried out against ISIL, if they do not know that towns like Sinjar that were controlled by ISIL have been taken back, or that a town like Tikrit, that was controlled by ISIL, now has been repopulated by previous residents, then they might feel as if there is not enough of a response. And so part of our goal here is to make sure that people are informed about all the actions that we are taking. But one of the interesting things that you have seen evolve over the last several weeks, including in the debates that are taking place between the Republican candidates, is that those who are critics of our administration response, or the military, the intelligence response that we are currently mounting, when you ask them, well, what would you do instead, they do not have an answer. And the reason they do not have an answer is because the truth is that the approach that we are taking is one that is based on the best counsel and best advice of our top military, top intelligence, top diplomatic teams. And we are going after ISIL effectively. We are going after them hard. Your critics have said they want to use more force. You have sometimes responded by suggesting that people who want to use more force want another Iraq War and that that is not practical. Well, when you listen to them, though, and you ask, well, what exactly are you talking about? Well, we are going to bomb more. Where is it that you are going to bomb? When you talk about something like carpet-bombing, what do you mean? We carry out precision strikes based on intelligence of where ISIL is, where their infrastructure is, where their oil tankers are. And if the suggestion is is that we kill tens or hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians and Iraqis, that is not who we are and that would be a strategy that would have enormous backlash against the United States. It would be terrible for our national security. And, you know, unfortunately many of these critics can get away with just suggesting that bombing more, or being less discriminant in how we approach that, would make a difference. Let me put it this way. I trust my commanders, folks who have fought long and hard in places like Iraq or Afghanistan, when they describe to me, here is how we are going to gather intelligence, here is how we are going to approach targeting.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio2", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-2", "publication_date": "21-12-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And the key is to make sure that we have got sound intelligence. And I make no apologies for us wanting to do this appropriately and in a way that is consistent with American values. Are you avoiding more force because you are concerned that even a little more force might call for the demand for even more force, and you would end up with a large war? What is interesting is that most of the critics have not called for ground forces. To his credit, I think Lindsey Graham is one of the few who has been at least honest about suggesting here is something I would do that ENTITY is not doing. He does not just talk about being louder or sounding tougher in the process. But as I explained, and I have tested this repeatedly with our military intelligence folks, when you start looking at an Iraq-type deployment of large numbers of troops - 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 troops - we are now in a situation in which we are committing ourselves not only to going door to door in places like Mosul and Raqqa, which I am confident that we could do, but we have essentially said to the Iraqis and the Syrians that we are going to govern for you. And that ends up being of an indefinite period. So part of what we have to do for a sustained defeat of ISIL is to help local forces develop capacity, do it the right way, do it for themselves with our assistance and our help, so that we can actually create a stable government structure in this region. Now that sometimes requires more patience than simply deploying a bunch of Marines. Our fighting forces are the best in the world, but in order to defeat an enemy like this, what we have to do is have a situation in which people can govern. You have acknowledged this requires patience. In October, before San Bernardino, a Justice Department official stated that he believed that domestic terrorists were a greater threat to the United States than international groups like al-Qaida or ISIS. Do you believe that still now, after San Bernardino and Paris? I do not know the exact citation that you are referring to. If you just look at the numbers, then non-Islamic, non-foreign-motivated terrorist actions have killed at least as many Americans on American soil as those who were promoted by jihadists.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithsteveinskeepnationalpublicradio2", "title": "Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-steve-inskeep-national-public-radio-2", "publication_date": "21-12-2015", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}
{"id": 3520, "text": "But what we have also seen is ISIL evolve, because of the sophistication of their social media, to a point where they may be inspiring more attacks, even if they are self-initiated, even if they do not involve complex planning, than we would have seen two years ago, three years ago, five years ago. The Fort Hood attack was inspired by Anwar Awlaki, who was with AQAP, al-Qaida in the Peninsula or in Yemen, and we have seen periodically self-radicalization through the Internet or jihadist propaganda. But ISIL is more systematic and more effective in their media, in their online presence, and that raises additional concerns. So part of what we have to do in response is to ramp up countering that narrative online, working with local communities to make sure that we are inoculating ourselves and our young people from this kind of recruitment. It is a more complicated problem because of the fact that a couple like the San Bernardino couple, you do not see in a way that you would see an organization that is planning a complex plot like 9/11. So in that sense we have some new dangers, some new concerns that we have to deal with. It is something that we have known could happen for quite some time, and it is something that, as I said over at the National Counterterrorism Center today when I visited, it is something that we have got some incredibly effective intelligence folks working on every single day. Leading candidates in both parties have suggested in one way or another that they want to be more active against this threat. You have argued for the approach that you are taking and that too much action would be unwise. What advice would you give whoever you are going to turn this room over to in a year or so? Again, I would just repeat, ENTITY, that when you really sort through all the rhetoric, the notion more active or a stronger response ... Hillary Clinton spoke about no-fly zones. There are basically two things that I have heard people say. You bomb ISIL. You are not trying to bomb innocent people. And that requires intelligence and confidence in our military to be able to develop the kinds of targets that we need.

{"id": 3521, "text": "The other new thing that people have suggested would be some variation of the no-fly zone or a safe zone. This is something we have been talking about for three or four years. The challenge there is that ISIL does not have an air force, so the damage done there is not against ISIL, it is against the Syrian regime. And what is absolutely true is that we need to make sure that we bring about an end to the civil war in Syria, and John Kerry, through the work he is been doing in Vienna negotiations and this week in New York, is seeing some progress in bringing Russians and Iranians together but creating a safe zone for Syrian refugees. We have tested, we have looked at repeatedly, the problem is that, again, without a large number of troops on the ground, it is hard to create a safe zone like that. And that does not solve the ISIL problem. My point is, ENTITY, that I think my main advice to my successor - now hopefully by the time I turn over the keys, we have made the kind of progress that I am expecting and will have pushed for over the course of the next 13 months ... Do you think there will be a united front against ISIS by then? I think we will have made significant progress in degrading ISIL by then. The diplomacy I think is critically important because to the extent that we can get the Syrian regime, Iran, Russia to recognize what we believe is the core threat, which is ISIL, and the disintegration of social order in Sunni-controlled areas in Iraq and Syria, the more effective and faster we can go. But what I would say to my successor is that it is important not just to shoot but to aim, and it is important in this seat to make sure that you are making your best judgments based on data, intelligence, the information that is coming from your commanders and folks on the ground, and you are not being swayed by politics. Whoever takes over this office after you might be a Democrat, might be a Republican, there may be a Republican Congress again.

Second of all, I think we have got a good chance of winning back the Senate, and the truth of the matter is is that where Democrats have had problems is we had the misfortune of doing poorly in 2010 when there was redistricting, and in many of the successive elections Democrats have actually voted at higher rates. This was true in 2012, for example. There were more Democratic ballots cast for Democratic candidates than there were Republicans, but because of where Democrats live and where Republicans live, and because of the nature of the Senate, we ended up having problems. So one of the things that I will be arguing over the course of the next year is to make sure that Democrats run an issue-based campaign on the things that we believe in and care about, and I think we have got a great track record of real progress on a whole range of fronts. If we make those arguments clearly and forthrightly and are not defensive, then I am actually confident we will do just fine. Have you insulated the climate deal, for example, which is so important to your legacy, from being undone by future presidents, given that many of the commitments you made in Paris are not legally binding? Well, keep in mind that the Republican Party in the United States is perhaps literally the only major party in the developed world that is still engaging in climate denial. Even far-right parties in other places acknowledge that the science shows that temperatures are going up and that that is a really dangerous thing we have got to do something about. And the deal that we struck in Paris was an example of American leadership at its best. We were able to mobilize 200 countries to make serious commitments that are transparent, where every country is going to be held accountable, where everybody chips in, and it does not solve the entire problem, but it puts the world on track to deal with a problem that could be monumental in its effect if we do not do something about it.

I think that the signal that we are sending to the private sector, that will in turn invest heavily in solar and wind and battery technologies, the doubling of fuel efficiency standards on cars, all these things start taking on a momentum of their own. And we have seen this since I came into office. Since my inauguration, the amount of wind power has tripled, the amount of solar power has gone up by 20 times. We have seen the costs of clean energy go down much faster than any of us anticipated. So they cannot stop you? And when we decide - what it means is that by the time that even a Republican president came into office, what you would have seen would be a growing realization that not only should we do something about climate change, but it is not only a challenge, it is also an opportunity, that it is creating jobs, that it is making a difference in people's lives, that consumers are saving money. When I doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars, that puts money in people's pockets. When you retrofit a building so that it is got better temperature control and you cut your light bill by 20 percent, 30 percent, you know what? In fact, when it comes to solar power, you have got this weird coalition between environmentalists and Tea Party-ers in some Western states because the traditional dirty fuel industry is trying to prevent greater utilization of solar power. So a lot of these things get institutionalized not just through government policy but through the impact that it has on the marketplace and the private sector.

I do think that the country is inexorably changing, I believe in all kinds of positive ways. I think we are - when I talk to my daughters and their friends, I think they are more tolerant, more welcoming of people who are different than them, more sophisticated about different cultures and what is happening around the world. But I do think that when you combine that demographic change with all the economic stresses that people have been going through because of the financial crisis, because of technology, because of globalization, the fact that wages and incomes have been flatlining for some time, and that particularly blue-collar men have had a lot of trouble in this new economy, where they are no longer getting the same bargain that they got when they were going to a factory and able to support their families on a single paycheck you combine those things and it means that there is going to be potential anger, frustration, fear. Some of it justified but just misdirected. I think somebody like Mr. Trump is taking advantage of that. That is what he is exploiting during the course of his campaign. But in other cases, an issue like Black Lives Matter and the question of whether, you know, the criminal justice system applies equally to everybody, that is been an issue in the African-American community, and to some degree in the Latino community, for decades. There is no black family that has not had a conversation around the kitchen table about driving while black and being profiled or being stopped. I think really what is changed over the last several years is the pervasiveness of smartphones and the visuals that suddenly have sparked a conversation about how we can deal with it.

You know, during that process there is going to be some noise and some discomfort, but I am absolutely confident that over the long term, it leads to a fair, more just, healthier America. Let me follow up on a couple of things you mentioned. You mentioned slavery. Among the many protests this year are two small but symbolically interesting ones at Ivy League universities. At your alma mater, Harvard Law, there is a seal for the school that is based on the family crest of a slave owner. At Yale there is a school named after John C. Calhoun, who was a great defender of slavery. The call is to get rid of those symbols. You know, as ENTITY of the United States I probably do not need to wade into every specific controversy at a ... But you can do it. But here is what I will say generally. I think it is a healthy thing for young people to be engaged and to question authority and to ask why this instead of that, to ask tough questions about social justice. So I do not want to discourage kids from doing that. As I have said before, I do think that there have been times on college campuses where I get concerned that the unwillingness to hear other points of view can be as unhealthy on the left as on the right, and that, you know ... Meaning listen to people that you might initially think are bigoted or ... Yes, there have been times where you start seeing on college campuses students protesting somebody like the director of the IMF or Condi Rice speaking on a campus because they do not like what they stand for. If somebody does not believe in affirmative action, they may disagree - you may disagree with them. I disagree with them, but have an argument with them. It is possible for somebody not to be racist and want a just society but believe that that is something that is inconsistent with the Constitution.

If what you are suggesting is is that, you know, somebody questioning whether I was born in the United States or not, how do I think about that, I would say that that is something that is actively promoted and may gain traction because of my unique demographic. But maybe you have got something else in mind. Years ago you made that remark, you were much criticized for saying something about people clinging to guns and religion. And although you were criticized for the phrasing of that, it seemed to me that you were attempting to figure out, what is it that people are thinking, what is it that is bothering people? Now you have had several more years to think about that. Well, keep in mind, ENTITY, I was elected twice by decent majorities. So the fact of the matter is that in a big country like this there is always going to be folks who are frustrated, do not like the direction of the country, are concerned about ENTITY.

It does not matter if I tell them actually it is probably because natural gas is a lot cheaper now so it does not pay to build coal plants. If somebody tells you that this is because of ENTITY's war on coal, well, you know, that is an argument you may be sympathetic to. So as I said, you asked a pretty open-ended question. I think you were being a little coy in how you asked it. I am trying to give you room to answer. No, I understand, but what I am saying is that I think that there is always going to be, every president, a certain cohort that just does not like your policies, does not like your party, what have you.

As I have said consistently, we have to raise the debt ceiling so that we preserve the full faith and credit of the United States of America. But we also have to solve the underlying problem which is we have been spending more money than we have been taking in and that is creating debt deficits and debt that date back to 2000. The last time we had a balanced budget was when Bill Clinton was president. And so what I have said is we need a balanced approach, we have got to cut spending that is unnecessary, we have got to eliminate waste and fraud and abuse, but we also have to make sure we have got revenues to pay for things like student loan programs, make sure that our seniors are taken care of, and yesterday what we saw was Republican senators along with Democratic senators in a bipartisan way both saying that we need to cut spending, including on some entitlement programs, but we also have to add more revenues. And that kind of balanced approach I think offers a way out of this dilemma and hopefully stabilizing the economy in a way that will help us create jobs here in America. Let us move to the economy for a moment here, Ohio's economy in particular. Manufacturing helped build our state. What do you do to revive that part of our economy in Ohio when those jobs continue to fade away? Well, I have to say the recovery has been obviously slower than we would like and we are doing everything we can to accelerate hiring. Manufacturing has actually been a bright spot in this recovery. We have actually seen more growth faster in manufacturing than in the rest of the economy. Now part of that is the work that we did in the auto industry, which is obviously very important to Ohio. We were about to see the liquidation of Chrysler and GM, they have come roaring back, they are now making a profit; they are actually increasing market share. Part of it is restructuring and better management but part of it is also starting to look at what are the products of the future? How can we build cars that are fuel efficient, how can we win the race for electric cars?

Their housing situation has not stabilized so they still have mortgages that may be worth or higher than what the house is worth. You know, young people who are trying to figure out how to afford college, so that is what motivates me on a day to day basis and my attitude is that if we are taking the right steps to improve our education system, if we are rebuilding our infrastructure, our roads and our bridges and putting people back to work, especially construction workers who've been laid off, if we are getting our fiscal house in order, if we are investing in research and development for the kind of advanced manufacturing we just talked about, and the economy's growing, then politics will take care of itself. And that is going to be true in Ohio, that is going to be true across the country. You nominated Richard Cordray earlier this week. Senate Republicans say they will fight that nomination unless you can make the bureau more transparent and accountable, is there room for compromise to win his nomination? Well, first of all, let us dispel this notion that somehow this agency is not accountable or transparent, it is completely transparent and completely accountable. It is working for consumers. The idea here is that we are going for the first time have a consolidated agency who is only job is to make sure that consumers are not getting ripped off when it comes to applying for mortgages, applying for credit cards, any financial transaction, they are not having to wade through a bunch of fine print finding that their interest rates are getting jacked up after they have already signed an agreement, and Rich Cordray is a perfect candidate for this job.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjerryrevishwbns10tvnewscolumbusohio", "title": "Interview With Jerry Revish of WBNS 10TV News in Columbus, Ohio", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jerry-revish-wbns-10tv-news-columbus-ohio", "publication_date": "20-07-2011", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I find that there is a certain immediacy to it that I like. I like the interviews and I like people being able to call in a question. George Stephanopoulos was here earlier, and he says in his view-and I assume he mirrors your own-your accomplishments in your first almost 2 years as President have not gotten through the screen of the media to the American people. Do you feel any sense of isolation here in terms of what you like, you have told us, that sort of one-on-one relationship with constituents? Part of it is the demanding nature of the job and the fact that Washington, DC, and its inner workings are a long way from the average life of most Americans. And part of it is the way news is reported today. News basically tends to be-a lot of studies have shown that the way news is reported tends to be more negative and more editorial, more commentary rather than what is going on. A lot of the research shows that the American people are surprised to find out that in 1993, for example, I had more success in getting a very big program through Congress, with the economic program and NAFTA and family leave, the Brady bill, than any President since the end of World War II except President Eisenhower's first year and President Johnson's second year. So we are doing well here, I think, in moving forward in an extremely contentious environment. And I just have to find ways to communicate better with the American people not only what we are doing wrong-the press will tell them that-but also what we are doing right and where we are going. From your side of the table, what is the nature of that contentious environment? I know that you, yourself, have pointed to a deep cynicism on the part of the American people.

And he was arguing why a republican form of government, meaning representative form of government, was better for big countries, that you had to elect representatives and then they'd do what they thought was right. Then they'd report back, be held accountable, and be elected or defeated by the voters. I think today there is so much-there is a lot of information about what we are doing up here, but I do not think there is a lot of basic understanding that we impart. And I think that voters know that too many decisions get made here on the basis of organized interest which may or may not be the same as the public interest. And I think that at a time of real change, when people are uncertain about where we are going, it is just easy for negative impulses, for fears, for cynicism to overcome hopes in looking toward the future. I also believe, and many astute people in the press have pointed this out lately, that voters themselves feel a certain ambivalence. That is, they want us to do things up here. I got elected to take action, to deal with the economy, to deal with crime, to deal with the breakdown of family, to promote welfare reform, to deal with the health care crisis. But people still basically are very skeptical about the Government's ability to do it. So we want, in a way, a Government that is more active but basically that is active in empowering the private sector to do things, rather than active in doing things directly. And a lot of times that explains the apparently contradictory feelings people have about what we are doing here, that they want us to be active and address the problems but they do not necessarily trust the Government to do it. Or as we say at home, a lot of people think Government would mess up a one-car parade. You are a student of history. Do you think that is because Camelot was illusory in the last analysis, that it is a mythical thing and that people are disappointed with both the Congress and various holders of your office?

That is what I called my new Democratic philosophy when I ran in 1992. I share what I think is the feeling of a majority of our fellow citizens, that the government should be limited in many ways and that government should do those things which it is required to do but no more than it is required to do. The Wall Street Journal reports this morning that Al From of the Democratic leadership conference just sent you a big memo, five or six pages long. I am not trying to invade your private correspondence, but one of the things they say he said to you was, rightly or wrongly, you have become too identified with liberal causes on Capitol Hill and therefore do not appear to some of the people who supported you initially as this centrist Democrat, which you said you were. And I think some of that may be my fault in terms of characterization. But if you look at what we have actually done, if you look at the economic program that I have put in place, it is bringing the deficit down for 3 years in a row, it is reducing the Federal Government by 272,000-certainly not a traditional liberal thing to do-to the smallest Federal Government we have had since Kennedy was President We are taking all the savings and putting it into the fight against crime, which is basically money to people at the grassroots local level. We are addressing the issues like welfare reform partly with tax cuts for working families with lower incomes and tougher child support enforcement-not traditional liberal programs. I think what happened was, more than anything else, the health care program has been characterized as a big Government program, even though it took what, at the time I proposed it, was the moderate course, which is not having a Government-financed health care program but simply having a program in which the Government requires everybody to buy private insurance and then gives tax breaks or discounts to people who cannot afford it on their own.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithgeneburnsworradionewyorkcity", "title": "Interview With Gene Burns of WOR Radio, New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-gene-burns-wor-radio-new-york-city", "publication_date": "24-08-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

When that happened, I think that that-I have been portrayed as sort of the apostle of big Government. I am about reinventing Government. I am trying to bring the Federal Government down. My Republican predecessors never attempted to do anything as ambitious as reducing the Federal Government to its smallest size in 30 years. I have fought for things that Democrats often do not fight for, including all these trade agreements to expand trade. I have fought to put the Government in partnership with our business interests overseas. Yesterday, just to give you a little example, we announced that for the first time in over 20 years, farmers in the Pacific Northwest will be able to sell their apples in Japan. For the first time ever, farmers in California are selling rice in Japan. These are the things that I have worked on. But there are some things that I believe- and this is worth debating-that the Government has to do. And when we have to do something, it should be as limited and efficient as possible. But there are some things that if we do not do it, it will not get done. Well, Mr. President, on the lobbying money, John Connally spent $10 million because he wanted to be President of the United States, and it was all wasted money, as we both know.  from my home State. I know her. I know her well. So all of this money being spent by the special interests on health care, which has to be conceded has been spent, is not going to get a warm reception unless there is a general fear of the growth of Government in the first place. I agree with that. I think-one of the things that Al From said to me with the Democratic Leadership Council-not in this memo, but I think it captures in one sentence the dilemma I face as President in trying to move into a post-coldwar world and take this country into the 21st century with a strategy for growth and opportunity, where the Government is not either just sitting on the sidelines or trying to solve problems but is being a partner with the American people", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithgeneburnsworradionewyorkcity", "title": "Interview With Gene Burns of WOR Radio, New York City", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-gene-burns-wor-radio-new-york-city", "publication_date": "24-08-1994", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

And I know yesterday morning in a conversation we had, he raised some points about the need for job training and some things of that kind, and we were able to point out to him that we would be very happy to talk with him about that after he is read what was already in our budget proposal. Does that indicate you could compromise on the jobs issue? I think you always sit down and see where you can come together on something that will be beneficial to the people. We think that he will be pleasantly surprised when he sees the direction we have taken on the budget. How far would you be willing to go for jobs programs? Well, we think that it is far more important to stress the idea of training, because we think there are a lot of people unemployed today at a time when there are jobs available. The increase in the advertising of employers seeking workers in all of the metropolitan papers in the country indicates that. The Democrats seem to want more.

And yet even here, in this budget, we are asking them to make a sacrifice and not take a cost-of-living pay raise, as we are asking the civilian employees. And I regret that very much, that we have to do that, because we are just getting them up to something that is fair, at least. Now, that leaves, if they are going to cut, they are going to have to cut in weapons systems, and these are the least of the spending. You will get very little savings in proportion to the deficit we are trying to hold down if you wiped out all the vehicles and all the airplanes and even the reserve ammunition that we are seeking to buy, to say nothing of ships and planes. There are some people who say, on the deficit issue, that you have intentionally been rather overly cautious and that you expect a much rosier picture down the road, and therefore you will not have as high deficits. Well, what we are trying to do because we do not want to get engaged in a debate up on the Hill that we are as is sometimes in the past they have tried to do-their saying that we were coming up with rosy estimates. And to get in that argument, what we have to look at is that among all the experts, all those who project economic estimates, there is a wide range of difference. Now, you cannot say some are more expert than others; so you have to say there is real leeway in there. So, we have looked at what the most pessimistic say about the recovery, what the most optimistic say.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjerryboydthestlouispostdispatchdomesticandforeignpolicyissues", "title": "Interview With Jerry Boyd of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Domestic and Foreign Policy Issues", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jerry-boyd-the-st-louis-post-dispatch-domestic-and-foreign-policy-issues", "publication_date": "01-02-1983", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

I actually think that we are being conservative and being modest with I happen to be an optimist, and I believe that some of the signs, the indications, the fact that there is a stored-up market out there with just one figure, has to do with where we are visiting today. A few years ago, the average length of time that people drove an automobile before they bought a new one was a little over 3 years. Today the average age of the automobiles on the road is 7 years. That indicates to me that there may be more of a backed-up market that has been delayed by the high interest rates and all that, when they can and do start buying. Do you think we are into a recovery already or is it beginning? I think the recovery has begun and I have to put it that way. We have had 9 months now in which, out of the 8 of those 9 months, all the economic indicators are up. But I think the key still lies in further reduction of the interest rates. What I see you saying is, if I understand you, that you expect a lower deficit than what is included in the budget. Just being an optimist, I will stick with our assumption. But I personally have a well, let us call it a hope that it may be a firmer recovery than is estimated. Your administration has tried to make some changes in the Legal Services Corporation. And you have people on the Board of Directors who have been charging the public for some fees that raise questions. How do you feel in general about the Legal Services Corporation? Well, I am glad you asked that, because, first of all, these totally false charges that would indicate that someone is doing wrong or taking the Government ignored the fact that the commission, under the law, is paid on a consultant basis on the hours they put in. And our commission just happened to put in more hours than the previous one, because we did want some reforms in that legal system. Also, the Congress had raised the hourly rate, and that was before we got on the scene. But I saw the legal commission from a different angle when I was Governor.

And this this at the expense of those individuals who had some legitimate legal claim and needed legal help in pursuing it. On the foreign policy front, were you trying to send a new signal to the Soviet Union through Vice President Bush in West Berlin? No; frankly, I was simply responding to their vast propaganda effort that would try to discount our legitimate proposal for arms reduction. Well, there are a lot of people who say that if you are really serious about it, the thing to do is just to call for a summit with Mr. Andropov without any kind of conditions, sit down and try to work it out. Is that out of the question? No, but a summit takes a lot of organization. You do not just say, Hey, let us sit down and talk about things. You look at the history of past summits, and you see that great time has been spent on arriving at what would be a practical agenda. And now we have three teams in Geneva negotiating arms reductions and this all at our instigation. And suddenly there is a propaganda campaign that seems to be aimed at posing them as the people who want peace, and that there is somehow something wrong in our proposals. What are you trying to do about it? What would you like to do about it? Well, I just called attention to what I had said a year ago November when I proposed that we start with the intermediate weapons now aimed at Europe, and to see whether we could not arrive at a zero base where they with their, well, more than a thousand warheads targeted on Western Europe. Western Europe with no deterrent to prevent their using them had asked for us to provide a deterrent missile system. And I said that it seemed more logical to me that, if they would destroy their missiles, we would not install ours. And Western Europe and Russia would be free of that nuclear threat.

And I believe that although, I do not know what the date would be or anything I know that well, he has been most helpful and, I think, would be prepared to do this. But I think, and I am sure he thinks, that we have got to resolve this situation in Lebanon first and get all the foreign forces to withdraw. Did you give President Mubarak any reason to believe that the situation in Lebanon might be resolved at least progress was being made in resolving it? We discussed, very openly, this, and whatever information we had for each other on the situation, we exchanged it.

I will see some of them in Central America in the next few weeks when I go down there, dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch. And the overwhelming impression that you get is that they are not only superb at what they do but that they are really good people and good citizens. That kind of teamwork that is required to pull off a military mission is something that they bring to all their work in life. I remember, I talked to a command sergeant major in Korea who can still run under a 6minute mile; he is in his late forties. And he is been in the ENTITY 29 years, and he is retiring. I said, What are you going to do when you get out? He said, I am going home to Kentucky to teach school, because I think I can do some good for those young people. So I see this. And I always try, when I am with our men and women in uniform, not only to get briefed in a formal way on what their mission is on a particular day but also to find out a little bit about their lives, how their families are doing, how many times that they have been deployed, how are they dealing with that. And whenever possible, I always try to take a meal with them, so that enables me to connect with a lot of them individually and get a real feel for what is going on. How do you feel they connect with you? What impression are you getting when they talk to you and answer your questions? Are they open with you? I think they are, I guess as open as you could ever be with someone who is in my position. I ask direct questions, and I always feel I am getting direct answers.

I do not think Americans who are not involved in the military have any idea how rigorous most of the training schedules are and what is involved. And the third thing, maybe the most important thing in terms of this budget we are trying to push on Capitol Hill, I do not think most Americans know how tough it can be today on the families. I do not think they are aware of how with a smaller military and fewer big engagements but a lot more small ones how much deployment is involved. I do not think they understand how quickly these people have to come in from being overseas or come in from being on a ship or being in a foreign land and then turn around and go back again. I do not think the family stress thing bothers me as much as anything right now, about where we are with the military. What are some of the things that you took into account, the factors, the decisions you made on pay raise, retirement Well, they were sending us a signal. We have got a lot of people retiring, and we are having trouble meeting some of our recruitment quotas. Now, part of that is a highclass problem; it is a result of the success of the American economy. And with the unemployment rate under 4.5 percent, wages rising at twice the rate of inflation now for the last couple of years, there are so many compelling opportunities for young people outside the military that it is harder to recruit and retain. We see it in Air Force pilots, but we also see it in enlistees in the Navy and the ENTITY. We see it across the board. So it is obvious to me that we need to raise pay, and we needed to fix that so-called retirement redux problem, you know, that I believe the Congress will go along with fixing this year. Sir, with all due respect, you offered the highest budget proposal in a long time ever. But is it enough when you talk about the things we are asking of them to do? They are at the tip of the sword.

{"id": 3542, "text": "Well, I think the real question is this what we are working out with the Congress now there is sentiment in the Congress to have an entire pay increase, and I think that, from the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs to the White House, we would all support that. But we have to operate within a given budget ceiling, so we have to measure what we need to do for our troops and their families off against the absolute imperative of being able to pay for training, which is more and more expensive the more sophisticated the equipment is, the more expensive it is to train on it, which is why we developed so many computer simulations and programs and the need to continue to modernize the equipment . You do not want a bunch of equipment out there that you cannot run because you do not have spare parts, you have not kept upgraded to high safety conditions. So in the best of all worlds, is it enough? I'd like to do more. But if we are going to do more, then we need to work it out with Congress so we are not robbing Peter to pay Paul. I mean, most of our men and women in uniform would like it if we invested more in them, in their families, in their quality of life, but they would not like it if, in so doing, we made it impossible for them to fulfill the mission they joined the military to perform in the first place. Well, I have been in half my adult life; I have children; I may have to educate them in college. On their pay, they cannot afford to educate their children. One of the things we helped a little at. I should point that out, I have not mentioned it the Defense Department is also working on changing the pay scales, so that the rewards will ramp up more for people who stay in longer as they reach different levels of achievement and service. And keep in mind now, the children of military personnel are eligible for all the financial benefits that we put out there for middle class families generally. I mean, now, for example, in the first 2 years of college, virtually all American families can get a $1,500 tax credit, and if you are in the 28 percent tax bracket, that is like $6,000 worth of tuition plus a dramatic increase in the scholarships, and a lowering of the cost of the student loans, and tax credits for all other higher education.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjanetlanghartcohenthearmedforcestelevisionnetwork", "title": "Interview With Janet Langhart Cohen of the Armed Forces Television Network", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-janet-langhart-cohen-the-armed-forces-television-network", "publication_date": "25-02-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 3543, "text": "So I think that we need to make sure our military families know about all these benefits and make sure they can take advantage of them, but I think on that score they will be all right. I am more worried about just whether the pay itself and the retirement are sufficient to allow good people to feel they can stay in, take care of their children, and know they will be all right when they get out. Do you think it is enough for recruitment? While it may be enough for retention because they are already invested, can we do more on recruitment? You and I were talking before we started the interview about this new innovative program the Navy is doing, and I hope that the higher pay, plus the better retirement benefits, will make a difference in recruitment this year. On the recruitment side, the biggest problem is the rest of the economy is doing so well, and the young people we have been getting in the military we have got fairly high standards for who can get in in the first place. If you were to do a pitch right now for those we already have, what would you say as to why they should stay? Because they are certainly not in it for the money. I would say, first of all, if you stay until you have got enough time in to retire, you will still be young; you will still have a whole other career you can work. We are going to do our best to get our budget on a plane where we will be paying you better. We are going to accelerate the maintenance of quality of life, improvement of those benefits. We are going to improve the retirement system for those for whom it was a problem. And the work you are doing is profoundly important to the country. We need good people to do it. And the skills you acquire in doing it will make you even more marketable when you leave. I see people all the time getting out of the service. Maybe it is just my perspective since I am not young anymore, but you can do a lot of these people doing 25, 26, 27 years, and they are still not 50 years old yet.

Well, first I would say that they are really the first generation of American troops to serve a United States that is both the dominant military power in the world and without a dominant military opponent, like the Soviet Union; that for 10 years now, we have been trying to work out how we can fairly fulfill our responsibilities to promote peace and freedom and prosperity, consistent with our ability to afford it and the need for our allies to assume their fair share of responsibility. And our military people have been on the cutting edge of this sea change. We have either gone into isolationism as soon as a war was over, or we got thrown into the cold war for the last 50 years, before the end of the cold war. And I would hope that they would be very proud of that, the idea that other nations would trust the United States, for example, to come into Bosnia, to deal with this crisis in Kosovo, to stand guard on the border with the U.N. troops in Macedonia, to stay in Korea decades after the end of the Korean war, because they know we have no territorial ambitions, because they know we do not seek to impose our will on other countries. They really know we are there for peace and security. And it is sometimes dangerous, sometimes boring, sometimes disruptive because of the rapid number of deployments that we have. But all of them should understand that they are part of a profound historic transformation in the world. And if we do this right, when we get through, the United States will share responsibilities for security with other democracies in a balanced and fair way and will be doing it in a way that is quite effective. I mean, one of the things that our people ought to be proud of is how effective they are in Bosnia, for example; how effective they are in the aftermath of the hurricane in Central America. Oh, I got lots of letters from Bosnia, people who I got wonderful letters from service people in Bosnia, men and women who went over there having questions about why they were going, was it worth it, was it going to be dangerous.

I think that of all ranks and all walks of life, our military people, they get caught up in actually seeing what they can do. The military is the most well-organized operation in our society, so you can only imagine the contrast between going into a war zone or a society that is totally dissolved over racial or ethnic or religious hatreds. To a little child who is used to living in chaos, seeing the United States as a symbol of both order and goodness, both things, is astonishing. And what I mostly hear back from the members of the Armed Services is when they see that and they see the human reaction it evokes and they see what it does for the image of the United States in those areas, most of them are very proud to have done what they have done. You talked about Kosovo. What are we going to do? Are we going in on the ground? Are we going to be just that 10 percent of NATO, or are we going to be the dominant force? Who is going to command people who go in on the ground? Well, first of all, unless there is an agreement between both parties, we will not go in on the ground, because we did not go in on the ground in Bosnia until we had an agreement everybody had to agree because we were a peacekeeping force, not a war force designed to win a victory and then enforce the peace. But we will defend ourselves. We will have vigorous rules of engagement if necessary to defend ourselves, just as we have had in Bosnia. And the more vigorous our right to defend ourselves, the less likely it is we will ever have to do it. But anyway, to go back to the first question, the difference in this and Bosnia is that this movement reflects the continued development within Europe of security capacity and the idea that the Europeans have that they should take the lead for their own security.

Most Americans did not know a thing about Kosovo or Albania until this whole thing started. But those folks knew about America. They knew about the American military, and they trust them to keep their word and do what they say they are going to do. So we will go in there if, in fact, it happens and I hope it does with only 14 percent of the force in the NATO command, working with perhaps other countries as well, like we work alongside Russians in Bosnia. That is one of the reasons that the mission has been a success. But this one reflects the continuing maturity and strength of the European capacity for selfdefense. We think that they should do more for themselves, but we also want to maintain our tie to the Europeans. Everyone lately has been talking about The Greatest Generation, from Tom Brokaw on down to Saving Private Ryan. I think this is one of the greatest generations, the men and women serving now. What would you say to them? Because I remember the day that we went to Normandy in 1994, and that had to be time for you. What would you say to the people serving now, if we look back 50 years from now, as to their contribution? Well, I would say that obviously what they are doing may not be as dramatic as landing on Omaha Beach, and I certainly hope it will not be as dangerous, ever. But what we know about World War II, looking back, is that even though after World War II there was this long twilight struggle of the cold war, it may be that World War II was the last war of mass slaughter of nation-states, certainly in Europe, because we stood up against the totalitarian dictatorships of Nazi Germany and their allies. So it was of historic significance because, in the aftermath of World War I, we hope at least that it nailed the coffin, at least in the West and other more well-developed countries, on mass warfare by nations. And huge millions and millions and millions of people died.

They are making the world safe for genuine self-determination, for freedom, for free commerce, for free exchange of ideas, in a way that no generation has ever tried to do or had to do before, because the world is so interconnected and one of these little problems can become a forest fire and spread around. So they really I think 50 years from now, when they look back, they will see that they did not bring an end to an era of slaughter the way the World War II generation did, with heroism and great sacrifice, but they did put America's military might to work in building a new world, which is something that I think their children and grandchildren will be very, very proud of. And there is no doubt that the United States could not have done it by economic power alone. Without our military alliances, without the expansion of NATO, without the deployment in Bosnia, without our ability to continue to try to stop bad things from happening and weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, without our willingness to stay on the Korean Peninsula to try to stabilize situations there and work through the other tensions in Asia, we would not have been able to do this. And if people in my position, the decisionmakers, if we do not mess it up, then the military will know that they were part of literally building the world different from any in all previous history. The recent mission that we had was Desert Fox. And we were fortunate at Christmas to be on the Big E, on the U.S.S. Enterprise, and we met a lot of the Navy pilots, and some of them were women.

And it is making a big difference. And there all these disputed areas of training, deployment areas, but I think that the disputes should not be allowed to obscure the underlying reality that the military has dealt with the gender difference in the same way it dealt over time with racial differences, to open up a maximum number of roles and give people the maximum opportunity to live up to their own ability. We were talking before about the pardon I gave posthumously to Henry Flipper, who was the first African-American graduate of West Point, remarkable engineer, good soldier, unfairly discharged. He was cleared of his dishonorable discharge over 20 years ago but never given a pardon, I think because we had never given a posthumous pardon before. But the Defense Department and I very much wanted to do it. We gave the fourth star to Benjamin O. Davis not very long ago in tribute to the Tuskegee Airmen. I think that looking backward is really a way of in this context is a way of ensuring you will continue to go forward. It is a way of reminding us how far we have come and what we missed when we deny any group of people who wanted to contribute to our military the chance to do so. I mean, there will always be controversies around the edges, rules to be worked out, difficulties to be dealt with, but when you give patriotic Americans who want to serve and who can serve well, the chance to do it, you win. Sir, if I may ask you a personal question, you have been a champion of diversity, you have always defended and stood up for the underdog, whether it is gender, whether it is race, whether it is age, whether even it is orientation. Where does that come from? I think two things in my longago past. First of all, with regard to women, my mother was widowed when I was born, and she was off studying to be a nurse. My grandparents raised me until I was 4. So I had always been around women who had to work to make a contribution to their family's welfare.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjanetlanghartcohenthearmedforcestelevisionnetwork", "title": "Interview With Janet Langhart Cohen of the Armed Forces Television Network", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-janet-langhart-cohen-the-armed-forces-television-network", "publication_date": "25-02-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

And I was always sort of rooting for them because of my mother and my grandmother. And on the race thing, I think it was because of my grandfather and the fact that when I was a child he had a little grocery store in a predominantly black area of this little town we lived in. Most of the customers were black. And most of what I learned about people and human nature and treating everybody the same and also discrimination, I learned as a little boy just listening and watching and observing and being taught. So, in a funny way, most southerners were at a most white southerners were at a disadvantage in dealing with the civil rights revolution because they were raised with more explicit racial prejudice. But some of us were actually at an advantage because we had more human contact with African-Americans before others did, and if we were lucky enough to have parents or grandparents that taught us differently, I think it made a difference. So I think those two things, you know, and just in my family we always had sympathy for the underdog, too. We never believed it was right to keep anybody down. And we were all raised, all of us, never to build ourselves up because there was somebody else we could look down on. And I think that is if you think about it, if you generalize that, really that psychological problem is at the bottom of a lot of this racial and ethnic hatred around the world. A lot of these groups themselves are deprived of opportunity. They have had economic adversity, had all kinds of diversity, and a lot of them, frankly, are taught as groups that what gives meaning to their lives is that they are not a member of this other group; at least they have got somebody to look down on.

I wanted to start by getting a sense of your mind-set coming into the job, and as I have understood you - and you can reject this - your perspective is that a mixture of universalist policies, in combination with an increased level of personal responsibility and communal responsibility among African Americans, when we talk about these gaps that we see between black and white America, that that really is the way forward. I think it is a three-legged stool and you left out one, which is vigorous enforcement of antidiscrimination laws. So the way we thought about it when we came in is that - and obviously we came in during crisis, so how we might have structured our policy sequencing if, when we came in, the economy was okay, and we were not potentially going into a great recession, and folks were not all losing their homes, might have been different. But as a general matter, my view would be that if you want to get at African American poverty, the income gap, wealth gap, achievement gap, that the most important thing is to make sure that the society as a whole does right by people who are poor, are working class, are aspiring to a better life for their kids. Those kinds of programs are, by design, universal, but by definition, because they are helping folks who are in the worst economic situations, are most likely to disproportionately impact and benefit African Americans. They also have the benefit of being sellable to a majority of the body politic. So you have got something like the FHA , which was on its face a universal program that involved a huge mechanism for wealth accumulation and people entering into the middle class. But if, in its application, black folks were excluded from it, then you have to override that by going after those discriminatory practices. The same would be true for something like Social Security, where historically, if you just read the law and the fact that it excluded domestic workers or agricultural workers, you might not see race in it, unless you knew that that covered a huge chunk of African Americans, particularly in the South.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithtanehisicoates2", "title": "Interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-ta-nehisi-coates-2", "publication_date": "19-10-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

If you have got those two things right - if those two things are happening - then a third leg of the stool is, how do we in the African American community build a culture in which we are saying to our kids, Here is what it takes to succeed. Here is how we support each other. Here is how we look out for each other. And it is my view that if society was doing the right thing with respect to you, programs targeted at helping people rise into the middle class and have a good income and be able to save and send their kids to school, and you have got a vigorous enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, then I have confidence in the black community's capabilities to then move forward. Now, does that mean that all vestiges of past discrimination would be eliminated, that the income gap or the wealth gap or the education gap would be erased in five years or 10 years? Probably not, and so this is obviously a discussion we have had before when you talk about something like reparations. Theoretically, you can make, obviously, a powerful argument that centuries of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination are the primary cause for all those gaps. That those were wrongs done to the black community as a whole, and black families specifically, and that in order to close that gap, a society has a moral obligation to make a large, aggressive investment, even if it is not in the form of individual reparations checks, but in the form of a Marshall Plan, in order to close those gaps. It is easy to make that theoretical argument. But as a practical matter, it is hard to think of any society in human history in which a majority population has said that as a consequence of historic wrongs, we are now going to take a big chunk of the nation's resources over a long period of time to make that right.

You have countries like India that have tried to help untouchables, with essentially affirmative-action programs, but it has not fundamentally changed the structure of their societies. So the bottom line is that it is hard to find a model in which you can practically administer and sustain political support for those kinds of efforts.

I feel pretty good about our odds in that situation. We are so far from that. Why are we even having the abstract conversation when we have got a big fight on our hands just to get strong, universal antipoverty programs and social programs in place, and we are still fighting to make sure that basic antidiscrimination laws are enforced, not just at the federal level, by the way, but throughout government and throughout the private sector? And those are fights that we can win because - and this is where I do believe America has changed - the majority, not by any means 100 percent, but the majority of Americans believe in the idea of nondiscrimination. They believe in the idea that Jamal and Johnny should be treated equally. They believe in the idea that a child should not be consigned to poverty just because of circumstances of their birth.

Now, I do not want to exaggerate; having as many African American men as we have had in the criminal-justice system, and the amount of time it takes for the damage done by that to wash through our society and our communities, the disadvantages born out of kids being undiagnosed with mental-health problems early, or not getting the kind of exposure to reading and math when they are 4 or 5 or 6 years old , that carries a cost.

Were you surprised relatively early on in your presidency when people criticized you for not having a quote-unquote black agenda ? I mean, I think if you worked at the community level in Chicago and then a politician on the South Side of Chicago, and worked at the state level, then you are pretty familiar with all the variations of politics in the African American community and criticisms you may get. If you are not familiar with those or you do not have a thick enough skin to take it, then you probably would not have gotten here. So it did not surprise you at all? I think, and look, ENTITY, I do not want to discount those criticisms, but offsetting those criticisms is that I have 90 percent or 95 percent support in the African American community and it is not sort of Well, he is black, so it is okay. We are not going to say anything even though we are seething. And I hang out with a lot of middle-aged black women, and they are not casual in their support of me. Partly because they understand the constraints of this society. It is one thing if they were watching and we were not working on poverty issues, and we were not working on education issues, and we were not working on health-care issues. You know, they are pretty sophisticated; they understand that I am trying to move an aircraft carrier here, I am not just steering the speedboat. And so part of it is, I think, intellectual, and part of it is obviously emotional as well. Michelle and I have never felt as if, at any stage, folks did not have our backs. And as a consequence, I think that just spurred us on that much more to make us want to do the right thing, and do our best in the positions that we have. So perhaps more substantive than that early-on critique, for instance - and Valerie and I talked a little bit about this - when you attempted to bring in some of the Black Lives Matter activists and folks refused.

And I just said to him, Young man, I am glad that you feel so passionately about this issue, but you are with ENTITY right now in the White House. You have got to think about what is going to be most effective in getting what you need, what you are trying to accomplish.

And so when people criticize or respond negatively to me, usually they are responding to this character that they are seeing on TV called ENTITY, or to the office of the presidency and the White House and what that represents. And so you do not take it personally. You understand that if people are angry that somehow the government is failing, then they are going to look to the guy who represents government. And that applies, by the way, even to some of the folks who are now Trump supporters. They are responding to a fictional character named ENTITY who they see on Fox News or who they hear about through Rush Limbaugh. What I am trying to get at is a theory - you are very unique in the sense that you are ENTITY but you have also been an activist. You have actually occupied both roles.

{"id": 3593, "text": "But having been an activist, the only thing that I am always encouraging activists to do is, once you have raised the issue, and even through controversial means, you have to come behind it with an agenda and the possibility of reconciliation if power meets your demands. And that was true during the civil-rights movement, that was true during the union movement, that is always been true. And so the only time I get frustrated with activist criticism is if I have recognized them, and invited them to work with me to figure out how we solve this problem that they are concerned about, and either they do not engage out of the sense of purity - I am not going to shake his hand - or you are not sufficiently prepared so you do not even know what to ask for, or you are not being strategic as an activist and trying to figure out how the process has to work in order for you to get what you want. I thought Brittany Packnett, who was one of the Ferguson activists, really interesting, smart young lady, really impressive - you might want to talk with her. So she was one of the organizers of the Ferguson movement, ended up joining our task force. She came in here and she just knew her stuff. And I do not think at any point backed off, even in our first meeting, saying, Here is what we are concerned about; here is where we are disappointed in the Justice Department's response; here is what we need. But she was sufficiently well-informed and engaged that it was very easy then to say, You are right about this, you are wrong I think about that, but I am not sure, let us sit down and see if we can hammer out a strategy that we agree with. And by the way, I want you talking to that police chief over there and that sheriff, because I think you might be able to persuade them if we break this down into its component parts. Now, in contrast, there have been times where, let us say on LGBT issues, when we were trying to end Do not Ask, Do not Tell, and I got the Pentagon and Bob Gates, a Republican holdover from the Bush administration, to authorize a study of how you might end Do not Ask, Do not Tell, headed up by Jeh Johnson, who at that time was a council to the Justice Department.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithtanehisicoates2", "title": "Interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-ta-nehisi-coates-2", "publication_date": "19-10-2016", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Barack Obama"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And I had laid out this strategy because if I could get the Pentagon's imprimatur on this thing, then I knew that we could end up getting legislation passed to reverse the policy, and we could get the branches of all the military to implement it. But during the course of that year, probably every speech I gave, I'd have gay activists just screaming at me during rallies. Not only do I agree with you, but I have actually got a strategy to execute, we are executing it, and in what sense do you think that you yelling at me here is going to advance your cause? But the problem was, and we saw some of this in the immigration-reform issues as well, was they had not done sufficient homework to know that I did not have all the capacity they thought I did in order to just execute this through the stroke of a pen. So I think that where I have gotten frustrated during the course of my presidency has never been because I was getting pushed too hard by activists to see the justness of a cause or the essence of an issue; I think where I get frustrated at times was the belief that ENTITY can do anything if he just decides he wants to do it. And that sort of lack of awareness on the part of an activist about the constraints of our political system and the constraints on this office, I think, sometimes would leave me to mutter under my breath. Very rarely did I lose it publicly. No, and the reason I say that is because those are the times where sometimes you feel actually a little bit hurt. Because you feel like saying to these folks, you think if I could do it, I have just done it. Do you think that the only problem is that I do not care enough about the plight of poor people, or gay people, or immigrants, or ? But do not they have some level of distrust towards you? They do not trust you to ultimately follow through. And is not that kind of the mind-set that the activist has to have?

I will give you an example that is outside the issues of social justice, but the criticism that some on the left consistently have given us around drone strikes. The truth is that this technology really began to take off right at the beginning of my presidency. And it was not until about a year, year and a half in where I began to realize that the Pentagon and our national-security apparatus and the CIA were all getting too comfortable with the technology as a tool to fight terrorism, and not being mindful enough about how that technology is being used and the dangers of a form of warfare that is so detached from what is actually happening on the ground. And so we initiated this big process to try to get it in a box, and checks and balances, and much higher standards about when they are used. But the truth is that, in trying to get at terrorists who are in countries that either are unwilling or unable to capture those terrorists or disable them themselves, there are a lot of situations where the use of a drone is going to result in much fewer civilian casualties and much less collateral damage than if I send in a battalion of marines. And I think right now we probably have the balance about right. Now, you would not know that if you talked to Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International or some of the international activist organizations. Certainly you would not know that if you were talking to some of the writers who criticize our drone policy. But I have actually told my staff it is probably good that they stay critical of this policy, even though I think right now we are doing the best that we can in a dangerous world with terrorists who would gladly blow up a school bus full of American kids if they could. But if suddenly all those organizations said, Okay, the ENTITY administration's got it right, and we do not have a problem here, the instinct towards starting to use it more, and then some of those checks and balances that we have built up starting to decay - that is probably what would happen.

You know you have talked quite a bit about your admiration for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., which is sincere and heartfelt.

You are accepting an institutional role that requires you to make hard decisions and hard choices, and as a consequence you have to take your moral sense and not put it aside, but rather take that moral sense and apply it to the particulars of a job that is going to test those ethical and moral precepts differently than if you are a professor, or a business person, or a dad. And if I were not comfortable with the judicious use of our military to protect the American people, than I should not have run for ENTITY. And having said that, I do think that the wisdom of a King or a Gandhi can inform my decisions. Will this actually result in America being safer, or the most lives being saved? But these kinds of questions arise not just in the military sphere. Going back to the discussion we were having about immigration reform, some of the most challenging discussions I have had are with activists who essentially would argue that any immigrant from Central America, let us say, who gets here to this country should be allowed to stay because their country is dangerous, their country is poor, and the opportunities for that mom and that kid are much greater here, and why would you send them back?

I have not talked to Speaker Rayburn on a spring recess, but the reason expressed in the release is exactly the reason why the atomic bomb plan was postponed. On March 23 the Press Secretary to ENTITY had announced that the tests scheduled for May 15 and July 1 would be delayed for about 6 weeks. The reason given for the delay was that a large number of Congressmen had expressed a desire to witness both tests but owing to the heavy legislative schedule would be prevented from doing so if the tests were held on the dates originally fixed.

I knew that somebody would ask the question so I have a perfectly good statement here. I shall read it to you and I shall give it to Steve and he will give you copies so you will not have to take it down. Will you read it slowly, sir? And the first sentence is in quotes-you will see why afterwards. The ENTITY of the United States ought not to interfere in party primaries. And then the second sentence is not in quotes. That statement, in one form or another, is appearing these days throughout the Tory Press. The idea is that the ENTITY should be aloof from such sordid considerations as who wins the primaries in his own party. But actually these primaries will determine to a large extent the makeup of the next Congress. And that, in turn, will determine whether or not the ENTITY can keep his campaign promises to the people. Campaign promises are supposed to be the responsibility of the whole party. But in practice the head of the party alone is held responsible for them. In American politics any one can attach himself to a political party whether he believes in its program or not. We hear the phrase read out of the party, but it does not mean anything. No one is read out of the Democratic or the Republican , Party. There are many prominent Democrats today who are heart and soul against everything the Democratic Party has stood for since 1932. And those men are still in the party. What is worse, not one of them was candid enough to oppose the renomination of ENTITY in 1936, although after four years there was no doubt whatever as to the program ENTITY was pursuing. The same hidden opposition, after giving the New Deal lip-service I in 1936, turned around and knifed it in Congress in 1937 and 1938. Now that election time has come around again, the hidden opposition hides the ax behind its back and prepares to give the ENTITY lip-service once more.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsexcerptsfromthepressconference104", "title": "Excerpts from the Press Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/excerpts-from-the-press-conference-104", "publication_date": "16-08-1938", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Franklin D.

The voter could take his choice between the New Deal and Tydings' record of consistent opposition to it. But Tydings tells the voters he supports the bone and sinew of the New Deal. He wants to run with the Roosevelt prestige and the money of his conservative Republican friends both on his side.

The word from some parts of the business community is that one part of that deal has already been struck; namely, that you will change the Treasury proposals and continue favorable capital gains tax treatment and accelerated depreciation and in return that you would continue the present taxation of dividends. Well, let me just say about that that I am hard put to answer a specific question of that kind. the one of what we want, the tax reform; the other with the necessity of coming in with the budget. We have been long hours around that Cabinet table on the budget matter and, finally, have now submitted it. We have not yet begun that process on the tax program. I think, as I have said before, I think that Treasury study was probably the finest and broadest study that is been made of the tax structure that I can ever remember. And I hesitate to give any opinion on any single thing until-again, those of us who've sat around the table on the budget are going to sit around that same table now on the tax program and go at every facet of it. I think we recognize that in that study-I do not think anyone has said, Why, buy this entirely as it is -we recognize there are things in there that are options. And so, I do not think that I could or should give an answer on a specific of that kind. Well, apart from the specifics, sir, it is been argued that venture capital has helped fuel the American economy in recent years. I think you agree with that. Does it worry you that by eliminating the special treatment given to capital gains that that might kill the goose that is laying the golden eggs? This is one of the things that- And, so, I think that this'll be one of the points that will be very much discussed, because the whole aim of both of these things-well, in addition to the tax reform being necessary to eliminate a lot of unfairness-and the biggest unfairness of all is the complexity of the present tax system-but, in addition to that, we are looking to these both as things necessary for economic growth.

What I am saying is, we will be giving each of these things consideration on that basis that I just outlined. Well, let me ask another concept question, then. Well, the way the Treasury proposal lowers individual tax rates is by increasing corporate taxes by 37 percent. Again, as a concept, do you generally favor that approach of individual versus corporate taxes? The corporate tax is given a ceiling of lower than the- Not the rates, but overall corporate taxes would go up about 37 percent under the Treasury proposal while individual taxes would come down. Is that a general approach that you endorse? I, as I say, I have not even made an attempt to study that bill in detail that much to know that. I assume that that would mean things that would be taken away from them that are present deductions. I would have to be convinced of the need to do that, because I am a believer that one day we must recognize that only people pay taxes. And someday I would hope that we could arrive at a tax structure that would recognize that you cannot tax things; you only tax people. Well, you also said last night that this was not going to be a tax increase under any disguise. If the bill is modified to meet the objections of some critics, whether it is from the business community or elsewhere, could it be that the bill would be a revenue loser? And would that be acceptable to you? I think what we are talking about here is a tax reform, and you are striving for neutrality in this. Now, in that kind of a reform, I am also sure that there are going to be some people, obviously, who are going to pay more tax than they are paying now. But, then, you are talking about people who are unfairly not paying a share of the tax today. And if you-the aim of this kind of a tax program, and I think this is true of all three of the proposals that are now before us-the two that are up in the Congress now, plus this Treasury report-I think it is true that one of the targets there is the large amount of tax that is not being paid, many times legally, by virtue of the complexities of the present tax laws, in which some who fairly should be paying a share are avoiding it.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithgroupseniorexecutivesandstaffmembersfromthewallstreetjournal", "title": "Interview With a Group of Senior Executives and Staff Members From the Wall Street Journal", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-group-senior-executives-and-staff-members-from-the-wall-street-journal", "publication_date": "07-02-1985", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And if it is revenue neutral, it will end up actually providing more revenues from the simple reason that you will broaden the base of the economy. Let me try one more tax question, sir. You also spoke favorably about the notion of lowering rates and, as you just said, broadening the base by eliminating many exemptions. But right after you did that, you then called for two new exemptions; namely, enterprise zones and tuition tax credits. Does not that just encourage others to try to carve out their own special places for their own pet write-offs and threaten to unravel that whole concept of lowering the base by broadening-or lowering the rates by broadening the base? Well, if you are trying to make a tax program more fair, which is also part of this proposal-take the issue you have raised of tuition tax credits. Here you have, I think, a very broad-based on fairness in the country-you have got people who are compelled to send their children to school under the law, because we believe that a democracy can only exist if you have a literate citizenry. And yet these people who, if they choose or feel they can get a better education for their children, choose a private or parochial school, independent school of some kind, they pay the full cost of sending their child to that school. But at the same time, they are paying the full cost that parents of children are paying-they are paying that in taxes to support the public school system. Now, if you stop and think what the additional cost to public schools would be if suddenly the independent schools closed and all those students were turned over to the educational market-and it would not mean an increase in revenues for public education, because already they are getting the money from those parents-you could see what a burden this would be. Well, it seems to me that it is only fair that some parent-as a matter of fact, the ultimate fairness would be educational vouchers. Does government properly support a school system, or does it provide the funds directly to the students to get an education? They could take that voucher and go where they want, and you put competition back into education.

But I think in many instances, when you sat down with those people and pointed out what the change in rates did, some of their hostility disappeared. I think the most important thing that we are going to face is, once we have settled on and agreed on a package that we believe is fair and is the reform that is needed, is then to make sure there is no misunderstanding or lack of understanding of what it will actually mean to the taxpayer. Basically, we found that the overwhelming majority of people were going to get a sizable decrease in taxes, based roughly on this setup, and that those that were not were going to get an increase were people who, as I say, are not presently paying their fair share. More generally on the economy, you have made it pretty clear that you believe that we are on the brink of a sustained economic boom. Are you worried that this might be cut short by the Federal Reserve? And would you like to have a greater say in Federal Reserve policy? Well, we try to work very closely, as closely as we can, with the Federal Reserve on this. And so far, I must say, right now they are on target-and that is we need a money supply that is commensurate to the growth in the economy and to continue that growth without inflation. And that provides two lines between which you must stay. And so far, as I say, right now they are right on target with that. Were you comfortable back in July and August? I think there were some times when it fluctuated widely and when they got well below their target and all. But, as I say, we are trying to stay in close touch with them. And I think we have made it plain what we believe. There are times when it is not an outright decision of theirs that sees the money supply fluctuating, and the fluctuations can be caused from other and outside forces.

And, if not, what is the purpose of aiding them? The purpose of aiding them is to aid literally the people of Nicaragua, who are striving to get the government that the revolution promised them. If you will recall during the revolution, the revolutionary forces appealed to the Organization of American States for help. And they asked the Organization if they would please try to persuade Somoza to step down and, thus, end the bloodshed. And, in return for this, they gave the Organization of American States the declaration of principles of what it was they were seeking in the revolution. This was all the civil rights and human rights, freedom of speech, freedom of labor unions, freedom of religion, and all of these things. Now, what happened we saw happen once before with Castro's coming to power in Cuba. He had other allies that wanted a democracy, and he never admitted to his true leanings until that revolution was over. Well, what happened was the faction known as the Sandinistas took over. They ousted a number of other revolutionary leaders; some of them were exiled; some, I think, were done away with; some imprisoned. But they have set up a totalitarian government. Their allies are Cuba, the Soviet Union, the Communist bloc, even Mr. Qadhafi, and now Iran is getting into the picture. But they have set up a totalitarian government. They have betrayed the principles that the people of Nicaragua were fighting for. And what we think is that we should be on the side of those people who actually are only asking for the democracy that they'd fought a revolution to get. It sounds as though you are saying that the objective is an entirely new government in Nicaragua. Well, when you answer a question that simply, though, and you come back, then, you see, you get into the thing-well, are you talking about individuals or are you talking-you are talking about the governmental form.

Well, I think you are putting some apples and oranges together there. The Carter situation was not dealing with unknown, hidden terrorists. They were dealing with a legitimate government, and not a very good government, but- -at least it was the government of the nation. You knew who you were dealing with; you were dealing with a national entity. The problem with terrorism so far and why, as I have said, much of the answer lies in what we are going forward with now, and that is better relationships with all the other democracies to where we will make extradition easy, we will exchange intelligence information. There are two ways you could deal with terrorism, and one of them is terrorism itself. Suppose in revenge, just on the basis that you think some people of a certain group or sect or belief did this, and then you strike back and perform the same kind of brutal crimes against some of those people, without any knowledge or assurance that you are getting the people who perpetrated the first crime. Well, that is no way to fight, and we do not believe in that. The thing is, you have to find an ability to locate the source, if possible; obviously, the best way is if you can infiltrate and then get some advanced information on when they are going to strike-be prepared for them. Our problem with the worst terrorist act-the big one, of course, was our Marines in the Embassy, was nothing but some suspicion of a certain locale in Lebanon, and yet there was no way to sort that out or separate it out from a community of other people and no way to strike back without causing a lot of innocents to die. And what we now, I think, are looking at is the possibility that some terrorists actually do have national support and backing.

Now, that is not really the goal of the Strategic Defense Initiative. I tie that to what I think is the goal of these arms negotiations. The Soviet Union-Chernenko and Gromyko both have publicly stated that they would like to see the elimination, ultimately, of nuclear weapons. All right, they have said it. Now, if they really mean it, we can go to a table and sit down and start negotiating reductions, aiming toward the elimination of those weapons.

How many missiles would we have to build to get enough through on a first attack that we would not be threatened with, then, the retaliation?

How about the other part of his criticism-the military pensions are bloated? I have to think this is a little different than any other pension program you want to name-the military.

And yet for 50 years, with the exception of about 4 years in that 50, they have controlled the Congress of the United States. But why do not they affect inflation and interest rates and unemployment now, if they are so bad? No, what they can do is get to a point in which the total debt-and remember, with all their moaning and crying, the national debt was about a trillion dollars when I came into office. And the first of those major big deficit increases occurred after I was in office. However, it was not my responsibility, because your first 8 months in office, you are on the other fellow's budget. I do not come into office and declare how much we can spend. The budget is there until the following October. In fact, when the bottom fell out of the economy in July of '81, not one facet of my economic program had been passed as yet. So, it could not have had anything to do with that deficit. But what is happening now indicates the danger that over the 50 years, the situation keeps getting worse. And let me give you one. When we put into effect the War on Poverty, which started in the last half of the sixties and ran through the seventies-and poverty won, because the rate of increase in people in poverty increased in spite of the War on Poverty and all those great programs-but in the 15 years from 1965 to 1980, the budgets multiplied to 5 times what they were; the deficit went to 38 times what it had been. So, you have got a built-in, structural deficit. And the President-to call it the President's budget-the President is responsible for submitting to the Congress what they have required in the programs they have legislated.

In another interview a few days ago in Moscow, gave a remarkable characterization of your qualities as a politician, and he praised your realism. After three meetings and many talks one-to-one, how would you characterize , and what do you regard as his main qualities? We can get into discussions where perhaps we are disagreeing quite firmly, and yet there is no personal animus in that with him. I think he solidly represents his country. I have suspected sometimes that he, having been raised in that particular country from childhood, believes some of their propaganda about us. But as I say, we can debate and discuss, and I think he is very sincere about the progressive ideas that he is introducing there and the changes that he thinks should be made. When it is over, I think that there is actually a degree of friendship between us. According to the State Department, we are moving toward an agreement that would allow American psychiatrists to visit Soviet mental hospitals to determine if dissidents are being imprisoned there. The Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights was quoted as saying that there seems to be a genuine interest in the idea of such a visit and in bringing the problem of abuse of psychiatry to an end. Do you think that a formal agreement could be ironed out during your visit to Moscow? I think that some of these things with regard to human rights is not just trying to interfere with their internal affairs at all. But in view of the fact that our country is made up of people from all over the world-and I have used the term myself previously in discussing with them that when a man takes a wife, he does not stop loving his mother-and you perhaps are aware that Americans all retain a feeling of their heritage, even those whose grandparents or great-grandparents first came to this country. I think when Americans get acquainted with each other the first thing they inquire is, you know, what is your background. And as time has gone on, most of us have to name three or four countries in our heritage if our ancestors came a few generations back. And the result of that is that in becoming closer and developing a relationship between the two countries we are affected by public opinion and by people in our country who resent if they think that in the land of their heritage people are being treated unfairly.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwitheuropeanjournalists1", "title": "Interview With European Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-european-journalists-1", "publication_date": "24-05-1988", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

And so, it is not a case of just wanting to impose our rules on them. It is to try and impress them with the need to eliminate some of the things that have grown with their system and that are unfair treatment, that are denying human rights to their own people. Could you please assess the prospects for a strategic arms treaty with the Soviet Union before you leave office on January the 20th. And do you see any possibility of another summit with Mr. Gorbachev later this year to sign such an agreement? Well, I will not rule it out. I will not say it is impossible because it does look as if a START agreement-I do not think there is any way now that the START agreement could come to a signing point in this summit. It is a far more complex treaty than the INF treaty that we did agree upon. Now, with ratification of that, I think that this summit will advance us further in the START discussions, and those people of ours and theirs that have been negotiating in Geneva on this will continue. And I hope that it can come about while I am still here, and I think they feel the same way just because they believe that there would be perhaps unnecessary delay then if you had to wait while a newcomer in this office settled in and got around to working with them. And so, I would hope that we can iron out the still-undecided points before I leave. And then I could see where we might decide that it should be signed in a meeting rather than several thousand miles apart in the-when the signatures take place.

I think you are a very good prophet-but they have changed lots of things-perestroika, Hungary, Chinese. How do you feel like a prophet? Well, I did not set out to be a prophet, but I just believe strongly that government can become too domineering and when-well, I thought in our own country that we had drifted to a point where government was, in a sense, at an adversarial relationship with its own business and private sector. And so, we set out to reduce regulations that we thought were unnecessary, to return authority to our States. We are unique in the world in that we were created as a federation of sovereign States. And much of our law and so forth was left with the States and the local communities nearest to the people, and then certain things that had to be done by the Federal Government. But this was not new with me in feeling that the central government had gone too far in imposing itself on these other elements. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, when he ran for election in 1932-one of his platform planks was that he would restore authority and autonomy to the States and local communities that he said had been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. So, this was not -and he was of the opposite party. But this we have done. And I think it has been responsible for the longest economic expansion in our nation's history, which we are in right now. And so, I could obviously see that, well, I disagreed with the whole theory of socialism and its advanced partner, communism, because that was a total imposition on the people. We set out, Vice President Bush was put in-I put him in charge of a task force to investigate how many regulations we could eliminate that had been imposed on the people and on local governments and so forth. And that commission was so successful that we estimate that we have eliminated 600 million man-hours a year of complying with government paperwork throughout the country. So, I am still critical of that system, but again I think that is not too far away from what the General Secretary is trying to do. He has found and is advocating changes.

Well, there is no question but that if we take it on a percentage of our gross national income we are perhaps having a higher figure in our defense spending than our trading partners are in NATO. And we have believed that since our Congress is making it more difficult for us to continue our rate of spending in defense that maybe our allies could increase their share somewhat. I do not think it is a problem that should cause any ill will between us, but we have in our meetings with our NATO partners suggested that it could be most helpful if they would assume a little bit more of the burden. May I come back, ENTITY, to Eastern Europe? We had these developments in Hungary last weekend, and we had a peaceful change of power in Czechoslovakia last year. How do you see these developments? Could this be the beginning of a process which could reach the Communist hierarchy in Romania, in Bulgaria, in East Germany as well?

And I think we have been doing quite a bit of that. And so, I would try to pass that on as a chore that the next President should continue. ENTITY, your Panama policy seems to be in deep trouble. You rejected a military solution to overthrow General Noriega, and your economic sanctions have so far failed to force him out, despite inflicting grievous harm on the Panamanian economy. And now Vice President Bush is saying that he opposes the dropping of drug charges against General Noriega. Well, he and I disagree on that. I recognize how it looks to some people with regard to that as a part of our effort. And I think he is aligned with this-that the goal must be the removal of Noriega from power. Here is a man who is able to actually drive the President of Panama into hiding for, literally, fear of his life. Now that is the goal, and we tried to do that with economic measures. We are still in a position of negotiating. The disagreement, however, over whether we were doing business with a drug dealer or not was based on a rather unusual thing. And that is when lawyers in this country got an indictment against Noriega on the basis of dealing with the drug dealers, they overlooked-you know, when I say it is unusual, it is unusual that you indict literally the head of another state-but they overlooked the fact that the Panamanian Constitution makes it impossible to extradite this man in response to the indictment. Well, then you have to say the alternative is that he stays there in power and able to continue his drug trafficking. And if it means quashing an indictment that cannot be enforced, I would suggest that that is not too high a price to pay for getting rid of him.

{"id": 3630, "text": "I made some remarks about that to an audience just a few days ago in a speech of mine. It is amazing how even much of our media can-well, I described it like being in a hall of mirrors and coming up with a false image. We announce a figure that we had the highest amount of exports in our history just last week. And how do they get at that? They will find some-I described it as their ability to see the dark cloud behind the silver lining. We took some practical steps in addition to those regulations that I mentioned. We had a complete overhaul of our tax system. Now, I am not a genius that thought of this all at once by myself, but I know that if you look back through our history invariably tax reductions have resulted in an increase of revenue for the Government. As a matter of fact, centuries ago there was a man named ibn-Khaldun who said in the beginning of the empire, the rates were low, and the revenue was high. At the end of the empire, the rates were high, and the revenue was low. When we got our tax reform, that brought the top bracket in our income tax, for example, down from 70 percent on the people who could earn in that bracket. When we brought that down to-well, now it is 28 percent. But first, our first move was to bring it down to 50 percent. Well, even that resulted in a great increase in the revenues from that same segment of people. Well, now, this has to mean that those people were so busy at that 70-percent rate in tax shelters that they were seeking, or in just simply not earning any more beyond a certain point because how much was taken away from them, once you made an incentive that they could keep almost three-quarters of every dollar they earned, they started earning more dollars and stopped looking for tax shelters. And the same has been through all of the brackets. That was one of the great features, I think, of our recovery. And then the other was getting government out of the way of the private sector. Our country, I think, probably leads the world in entrepreneurship. We have created in the last 5 years 16 million new jobs. Now, most of those jobs have been created by new or small businesses-not the great corporations with their thousands and thousands of employees, but the individual with an idea that goes into business for himself or the individual that is got a few employees and then suddenly he is got 200.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwitheuropeanjournalists1", "title": "Interview With European Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-european-journalists-1", "publication_date": "24-05-1988", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["Ronald Reagan"], "gender": ["M"]}}

Well, all of this is what has resulted in what the leaders of your countries in our meetings have called the American miracle. And as a matter of fact, many of those leaders have been very frank in saying to me that they would like to be able to remove some of the restrictions and restraints on the private sector, private enterprise in your countries. And we talk about that a great deal, and maybe we are going to see some results elsewhere. ENTITY, I know you are still very much in charge, of course, but next January you will leave the White House. And how would you like to be remembered, and what about the Reagan legacy? Well, I would like to feel that what I had left will be continued-the economic policies and the restraints on government. And one other thing, when we came into office, our defense capacity had been so reduced that on any given day 50 percent of our military aircraft could not fly for lack of spare parts, 50 percent of our naval vessels could not leave harbor for the same reason or for lack of crew. So, at the same time that I was trying to reduce the spending of government and the share that it was taking in the private sector, I had promised in the campaign I was going to restore our military. Well, we not only did that, but at that time, there was a great wave of feeling across our country that, well, that things were not the way they used to be, and there was a lack of patriotism. I likened it to the fact that I said I thought the people were ready for a spiritual revival. And I am pleased to tell you that that has happened, and I get more mail and more people stopping me, if I am out on a public appearance or something, to tell me that the thing they are grateful for is the renewal of patriotism and feeling about our country.

And what special roles do you see Japan can play in areas beyond economic constitution in--of global partners with the United States? First, let me say I think the G-7 meeting will be a very important opportunity for the leaders of the major industrialized countries of the world to reaffirm their commitment to global growth, to democracy, and to security concerns. I believe there will be serious discussions about three issues on the economic front, one really perhaps for the first time. The first is that I think there will be a real discussion about how we can coordinate our economic policies in ways that will produce growth. From the first week I was in office, we have spent a lot of time working through the finance ministers, the foreign ministers, and others to talk about how we can coordinate our strategies. For many years, other nations have asked the United States, for example, to lower the budget deficit. And we are working very hard on that, first through this $500 billion deficit reduction program that has now been passed by both Houses of our Congress, then through taking on a health care problem which is the biggest source of our growing deficit. And we need to make sure we are coordinating those policies with things which will produce an overall higher level of growth than we now have. It is a big problem for the United States, because two-thirds of the new jobs we have created here in the last 5 years have come from increased trade with other nations. The second issue I think that we will discuss and, I hope, make some genuine progress on, creating a more open trading system and increasing the chances that we can successfully conclude GATT by the end of the year. The third thing that I hope to see a very serious discussion on is the microeconomic policies of each of our nations and how we can all do a better job of creating jobs within our economy. Even Japan, with its very low unemployment rate by western standards, is having some trouble now creating new jobs. But it is a very big problem for the United States and for every other country represented around this room today. What kind of labor support systems do you have; what kind of education and training systems do you have; how do you target investment to create jobs?

So I think that this will all be-we will deal with this, and I hope in a very informal and forthright atmosphere. It will be an interesting summit, because there will be several of the people there attending their very first one, first G-7, all at the same time. The second point you made about Japan's role in the world, I am going to do what I can while in Japan to strengthen the bilateral relationship between the United States and Japan. In many, many ways it is our most significant bilateral relationship and the key to what happens between the United States and Asia. It is interesting, even though we have incredibly important ties to Europe, economic ties, we have a huge-40 percent of our trade is now with the Pacific. It accounts for almost 2 1/2 million jobs in America, trade with the Pacific. And we have major security concerns, as you know, with regard to Japan and with Korea. So I am very hopeful that even though Japan is going through a period of political transition, which I hope the Japanese people will view with excitement and interest, not with too much concern, this is a normal thing for a democracy. And periodically you go through these periods of significant change, and I view it as a positive thing for a great country. I think it will leave you stronger and in a better position in the world. So I hope we will discuss a lot of our bilateral economic as well as strategic concerns there. And I hope that when I leave Japan, our relationship will be even stronger than it is when I enter. ENTITY, there was a court decision this week that is a roadblock to ratification of the NAFTA agreement. Your administration has said that you will go ahead, but you do not appear to have a lot of wiggle room in Congress on some of your other economic initiatives. And I am wondering, first of all, how you are going to ensure the passage of NAFTA. And secondly, on the eve of the summit, this raises the whole issue of the conflict between environmental concerns and economic growth, and whether it is drift nets in the Pacific or toxic waste in Mexico or the whole problem of aid to the former Soviet Union, that conflict between the environment and economic growth underlies a lot of these issues.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists8", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-8", "publication_date": "02-07-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 3636, "text": "And I am wondering how you see reconciling those issues at the G-7. Let me mention the NAFTA first and then I will answer the larger question. First, on the narrow issue of the lawsuit, we announced within an hour after the court's decision that we would appeal. And we believe we can win an appeal, and we can win it within the appropriate time. There may also be some other avenues which will permit us to do some kind of environmental impact statement and still meet the time limit. There is a strong opposition to the agreement in some quarters in the United States, and the relative economic problems that we all face now make that more difficult. It makes some in Europe less enthusiastic about the GATT now. It is the same reason-it is just-a part of it is almost endemic to the human condition. I do think we have the votes to pass NAFTA in the United States Senate. And I think that-and we do not have today the votes to pass it in the United States House. First of all, by successfully concluding the agreements now subject to negotiation between Canada and Mexico and the United States to strengthen our common efforts at lifting labor standards and environmental quality, particularly along the Rio Grande River, which has been a huge problem. And I should say by way of background for the rest of you, the reason the labor standards issue is so big is that there was a report issued in this country last year that indicated that the Caribbean Basin Initiative of the United States, where we tried to get investment in Caribbean countries and put plants down there, had not led to increasing the per capita incomes of the people working in those businesses; that because the people were so poor, that a lot of the people who had taken the money that the United States Government had put out had still depressed their wages and increased their profits. So we have given some thought to this labor standards issue here and the environmental issue. So I think if we get those agreements that will help. The second thing that will help is if we have to just make the case, you know. Now when we have an agreement, it is a lot easier to defend the jobs argument. Right now there is a simple argument against NAFTA being waged by, articulated by Mr. Perot in this country and others, that you cannot make a trade agreement that takes down all the barriers with a country on your border with a per capita income that is only one-eighth as much as yours is.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists8", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-8", "publication_date": "02-07-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 3637, "text": "Everybody will take their money and invest in the other country. Well, it has great superficial appeal, but the truth is that anybody who wants to go to Mexico and invest their money for low wages can do so today. But the market opening measures that have been taken by President Salinas in the last few years have led the United States from a $5 billion trade deficit to a $6 billion trade surplus with Mexico. And we are in effect because Canada, as you know, is our biggest trade partner-we are now building this hemispheric economic bloc that we want. And so I think we can refute it on the merits. The third thing we have to do is ask the economists to consider what will happen if we do not pass the trade agreement. Our relationships with Canada are secure, and we have a bilateral agreement, and that is fine. But we could go back in our relationships with Mexico, which would mean economic problems for Mexico, more trade barriers, fewer jobs in America, more illegal immigration. A lot of problems could develop for the United States if we do not do the NAFTA. However, I believe that our goal ought to be to find ways to make preserving the environment good economics. At the Rio conference last year, Japan, Germany, and many other European countries were proving that you could do that because they were down there promoting environmental technology while the United States was trying to stop the environmental agreements. I think that our country was not as wise as many of the nations here represented in the way they approached the Rio conference. We have now signed on, the United States has, to the Biodiversity Treaty. And we have basically adopted a policy of long-term environmental preservation with an aggressive effort to figure out how to make jobs and incomes and prosperity flow out of that. And I believe that there are lots of opportunities to do that. If I might just mention one, our bilateral aid package to Russia that is now making its way to the Congress focuses heavily on what we can do with our technology to help them to reduce the problems that their nuclear industry-and not simply their bombs but their nuclear power plants, for example-present to them, and what else we can do in the area of energy and the environment to help to clean up their environment in ways that are good for their economy and good for ours.

But I think that it is very important-and almost to change the atmosphere and the attitudes of the peoples of the G-7. Yes, we are having economic trouble. And the fact that we are all having it should be some indication that there is some sort of historic change going on here and not that there is some character flaw in our people or some great mental breakdown in our countries or something else. This is a tidal wave of global change going on here. We have innovative work forces; we have great bases of technology; we have an understanding of how the world works economically. And I think we have within our power the means to move forward and break out of this problem we are in but only if we have the courage to keep changing. And so I would say, to try to answer your question directly, there have been debates for years about whether the C, -7 process accomplishes anything. But if nothing else, if we can agree among ourselves to take an expansive view of the future and to talk about the strengths of our nations and to recognize that there are only three ways to grow our economies. One is through the changes we make internally, the microeconomic changes; the other is through coordinating our larger macroeconomic policies; and the last is through creating a more open system of trade so that there is global growth. It is hard for the wealthy countries to grow wealthier unless the people below us are getting wealthier and can buy more of our products. And so I feel very strongly that we ought to come out of the G7 with a more vigorous commitment to get the Uruguay round done. Now let me just say what I have done in that regard. I have repeatedly said that the United States would bend over backwards to get that done this year, that there are changes that we would like to make.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists8", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-8", "publication_date": "02-07-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

So I do not know what else I can do, except that I think a lot of this is a matter of attitude. We have to try to lift our own visions and lift the spirits of our people and realize that when you are in difficulty, the worst thing you can do is to hunker down, to withdraw. When you have difficulties like this with a fundamentally sound system, the time is to change, to be innovative, to be creative, and to reach out. And I think that is what we have got to begin to do at the G-7. The tone, the atmosphere, the ideas that are discussed in that sense may be far more important than anything specific that comes out of the communiqu?. What direction are we going to take the world in? ENTITY, nobody seems to be happy with the G-7 process, not to mention the results. I wonder if you could define for us-elaborate on what you just said-that the purpose of the G-7 in today's world and tell us what you would like to change. Well, I do not want to be too presumptuous, since I have never attended one before. I have only read about them before. You know, I always followed them very closely. But what we are striving for-I think the other leaders agree with me, including those like Chancellor Kohl, who is been to many of these. My own view is there ought to be enough time at these C, -7 meetings for a serious discussion among the leaders without a lot of bureaucratic procedures and rules and regulations about these big issues. What can we do to create more jobs? How do you explain the fact that France, for example-let us take France. France had a productivity growth rate that was the highest in Europe in some of the years of the late eighties and still had relatively high unemployment. The United States, which has far fewer labor supports than most of the European countries do, still has difficulty getting its unemployment rate below 7 percent.

We should be able to really talk through very frankly what the political and other economic barriers are to getting the GATT done and really think about it and talk about it. It is far more important than what is in the specific words of the communiqu?, whether we come out of there with some sort of commitment to do something, to take action, and to move. Let me just give you one example. I am trying to do something that our country has not done before. We are trying to dramatically cut our Government deficit at a time when our economic growth is slow. Traditional economic theory would say if you have a sluggish economy, you do not cut spending and raise taxes; you might do the reverse, right? Why am I trying to do that? Because we are in a global economy, and the United States deficit caused an imbalance in the global economy, okay? But now, this can work for us for a while just on our own, because we had so much debt in the 1980's accumulated at high interest rates, by bringing down the deficit, interest rates in America have dropped very low. So businesses and homeowners are going out now and refinancing their debt, and that puts a lot of new money into our economy. So I can get a little bit of growth just on what we do here. But in the end, this will only work if there is an expansionary policy in Japan, if Europe is able to resume a higher level of growth so that the system is brought into balance, because what we do has a complementary action in the rest of the G-7. So these are the things, it seems to me, that really matter. And that is why I think these G7 meetings can really make a difference. But I think that if we get all hung up on-you know, we all have to have these prepared statements, and we are afraid we are going to say one word out of the way or make one little mistake which makes a huge headline in some country. And then we have got to have every little word right in these communiqu?s. I think that is just-that takes a lot of time and energy away from what we should be doing, which is focusing on how we can make the lives of our people better and fulfill our responsibilities as leaders of the world.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists8", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-8", "publication_date": "02-07-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

Why has this happened and what can you do at the summit to clarify U.S. goals and reassure U.S. allies? Well, let me first of all take issue with you-I mean, not the perception. The other nations of the world have asked the United States for years and years and years internally to do one thing. The only thing they ever asked of us internally was to do something about our budget deficit, which caused a significant imbalance in the global economic relations. I read about it for years before I became ENTITY. And we are doing that, and it is very tough to do in tough economic times. And we are going to wind up with a very tough deficit reduction plan that we believe is good for our economy over the long run. And it is not been easy to do, but we are doing that. Secondly, the major crisis this world has faced since I have been ENTITY, I think, was what would happen to democracy in Russia. And when it became apparent that democracy was in trouble in Russia because of what was happening with President Yeltsin, I immediately publicly supported him. I called every other leader in the G-7 and many others around the world and asked for people to support him. And I think that we had something to do with the outcome of events there. I announced a $1.6 billion aid package to Russia, and we have now, by the way, obligated well over half of that money. And then I announced another $1.8 billion bilateral aid package to Russia which passed the House of Representatives with 75 percent of the vote almost last week, bipartisan support. It is going to fly through the Senate. The IMF gave their first installment, $1.5 billion, to Russia the day before yesterday, and we are going to discuss that at the G-7 summit. I think-and that is a huge potential market for all of us and a major political issue. And I think that is the big issue we have faced, and I think we have done it very, very well. Now, the only point of contention between us that I can see-we will come back to the Japanese issue; you asked that and I have not forgotten-but the only-in Europe is that we have not agreed entirely on how to handle Bosnia, although we have done a lot of work together.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists8", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-8", "publication_date": "02-07-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

We believe and the Germans believe the arms embargo ought to be lifted on Bosnia. I understand that. But that does not mean we cannot do anything together. And this, I think everyone would admit, is the most difficult international problem that we face. I am still hopeful that something humane, decent, and politically reasonable will emerge from this process before it is too late. But we all have a disagreement on that, and I am sorry we do. But we cannot agree on everything. I think events subsequent to the Athens meeting prove that beyond question. But nonetheless, I do not think that is a reason for us to give up on the European alliance, give up on NATO, give up on the G-7. With regard to Japan, I think everyone who has looked at the problem seriously thought there would have to be some realignment in our trade relations. And I think we are going to work that out. But there are lots of other things we have in common. Japan has supported the United States, and the United States has supported Japan in the things we have done to support democracy all over the world. I intend to reaffirm my commitment to that when I am in Japan, and my commitment to Korea and to Asia generally when I am in Korea. So I think a lot of this-let me-if I might, a lot of this uncertainty in Europe, particularly, is a function of two things. One is the economic problems that we all have which make people always just more insecure. And we have a new Government in France. We have a new Government in Italy. We have a new Government in Canada. And so a lot of these folks, we do not all know each other. And I think when people do not know each other, there is always a-but you are trying to get to know one another-there is the temptation to take whatever incident is in the moment and reach some huge encyclopedia of meaning in it, which may or may not be accurate.

So I am just a lot more hopeful about this than I think some are. I think a lot of this is just a function of economic difficulties and new players who do not really know each other thoroughly yet. ENTITY, if I may go back to trade, I would like to know what do you say to the French, who have decided that they will not sign anything regarding GATT at the Tokyo summit up until the United States lifted or the Department of Commerce lifted the sanctions of steel, and we insisted that the United States accept the principle of multilateral mechanism to solve commercial conflicts. First of all, the action that was taken on steel was taken after a lot of deliberation, most of which was done before I became ENTITY, subsequent to United States law, which is clearly GAIT-consistent. So, I think, you know, if the belief is that the United States has been wrong on the facts, then we can discuss the facts. But there is nothing wrong with our law, and it is not that different from the laws of a lot of other countries that are part of the world trading system. Secondly, with regard to the trading mechanism, I have no problem with a multilateral mechanism to enforce trading agreements. But the GATT clearly contemplates that every country in the world, including France, should have the right to act in its own interest if the international system breaks down, which is not to say that you lose some rulings. But if there is no resolution of a crisis, the international system breaks down. All our Section 301 trade law does is to provide for some ultimate reservoir of authority for the United States to act unilaterally if the system itself breaks down. If France, for example, would like to propose a stronger multilateral decisionmaking process as a part of GATT before any country could act on its own, I would be more than happy to discuss that. I do not see this Section 301 as giving the United States the authority, for example, to decide on its own about all these trade agreements and how they affect us without regard to what other countries want to do.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignjournalists8", "title": "Interview With Foreign Journalists", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-foreign-journalists-8", "publication_date": "02-07-1993", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

And so far you have and your Government has somehow created the impression that Europe and the difficulties in creating jobs should be loaded at the doorsteps of the Bundesbank. And yesterday you even said, Well, this is a contribution to global growth. And you raised the expectation and the-that it was just a cyclical problem. Now, why did not you come out before with this very strong statement that you are looking for structural impediments, that the G-7 should concentrate on doing away with structural barriers instead of pushing all the time the micro question-the macro question, excuse me? Well, first let me say that I have not criticized Germany in the past, but I have complimented them when the Bundesbank has lowered interest rates. And I know that because I realize that, first of all, all nations with independent central banks-and the United States has one, too; that is, the Federal Reserve-independent of the-all nations that have independent central banks are very sensitive about political leaders from within the nation telling them what to do and even more sensitive to suggestions from political leaders outside the nation's borders. And so what I have attempted to do is to say repeatedly, ever since I became ENTITY, that I thought that the extent to which we could coordinate the economic policies with Germany and the rest of Europe, and Japan, that that was a good thing. Coordinated economic policies for growth, and expanded trade, and smarter internal, microeconomic policies were all necessary to create jobs and growth in the world. And when Germany-when the interest rates were lower a couple of days ago, I did applaud that because I think it makes a contribution to growth. But I think-and the only reason that I-and I have done it not to be presumptuous but only to say that the United States was asked for years by its allies to deal with our budget deficit.

{"id": 3652, "text": "I wanted to ask about the debate that is growing in Washington over free trade, the trade deal with the Pacific, fast-track authority for you to finish that free-trade deal in the Pacific. And I wanted to start by asking you about your own party, the Democratic Party. When Nafta was voted through in 1993, there were 27 Democratic senators who voted yes, 102 Democratic House members who voted yes. You'd be lucky to get a fraction of those votes today for this deal. So what is happened to the Democratic Party on this subject? Well, first of all, we do not know how many votes we will get yet, so - so we will wait and take a look. A couple of things have happened. First of all, I think it is important for us to understand that free trade is good for the United States. We have the best workers in the world, the most innovative companies in the world, the best products in the world, the most productive agricultural sector in the world. We want to sell goods made in America elsewhere. And 95 percent of the world's market is outside our borders. If we are not selling outside the United States, then we are going to have problems. And we want to make sure that we are not being impeded by a bunch of unfair rules outside of the United States. And I think that back in the 1990s, when Nafta passed, President Clinton made the right arguments about why it was important. The problem was that, at that time, we did not get some of the protections around labor rights, environmental issues included in the agreement in an enforceable way. When WTO passed, that allowed China to come into the world economic system. That was the right thing to do geopolitically - it stitched China together with the rest of the world - but China was not subject to some of the enforcement mechanisms needed if they manipulated currency or engaged in non-tariff barriers in terms of entering into their market. And so, over the course of 20, 25 years, what you saw was trade benefit the U.S. economy in the aggregate with cheaper prices, inflation low, the creation of a global supply chain that was good for U.S. companies, but what is true, and the best economic data seems to show is that there was some erosion of our manufacturing bases at the time.

And you'd meet workers that felt completely betrayed by, you know, the loss of good middle-class jobs - you know, if you went to a factory, you were willing to work hard, you could get ahead. And some people have been suspicious, feel burned from some of those experiences. The argument that I have made consistently is that is not a reason for us not to enter into trade agreements anymore, it is a reason for us to strengthen the trade agreements that we do enter into. And that is exactly what we have done with respect to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. What we are negotiating will be by far the most progressive, high-standard trade agreement in history. If and when this agreement is completed, you are going to have countries who have very low, if any, environmental standards in the past suddenly having obligations to deal with issues like deforestation or dealing with overfishing their waters or pollution or child labor. job training, rebuilding our infrastructure, making sure that we got the best education system in the world, making sure that we are protecting our workers and - and fighting for strong labor rights here in the United States of America. But what we are not going to do is to reverse the trends of globalization. We have got to be in the game. And we have got to make sure we are writing those trade rules in the fastest-growing region of the world, the Asia-Pacific, as opposed to having China write those rules for us, in which case American businesses will lose and American workers will lose. So do you think the people in the party, your party, who are not in favor of this - you know, the Rich Trumkas and Elizabeth Warrens - are they simply mistaken, or are they being dishonest about their criticism? I - I think that they are responding to very real anxieties and fears felt by U.S. workers who have not seen their wages or their incomes go up over the last 20 years, and then got hit by the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

And they are right to be concerned about those trends. I am, too, which is why everything I have done since I have been president has been focused on what I call middle-class economics. So make the case to the average working-class American about why the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Asian trade deal, is good for them. The argument is, number one, that is the biggest market in the world and it is going to continue to be the biggest, even more so the biggest market in the world as, as we go forward, the most populous, fastest-growing. We have got to be able to sell our stuff there. Number two is those countries are already selling to us. I keep on pointing out there are a lot of Japanese cars here in the United States, almost no U.S. cars in Tokyo. And so the more we can get access to markets that are currently closed, but that are selling to us, that is better off for U.S. workers. Number three is that if we do not write the rules, China will write the rules out in that region. That will mean a loss of U.S. jobs. You know, when I was in Panama during the Summit of the Americas, Boeing had just made a multibillion-dollar sale to a Panamanian air carrier. Boeing has suppliers all across this country, small- and medium-sized businesses who are directly benefiting, who are going to be employing people as a consequence of that sale. And we want to continue to make those kinds of sales in the region. And the last point I would make is that, when you look at some of the provisions that we are negotiating in TPP, we are raising the standards in many countries, in places like Malaysia or Vietnam, in ways that directly help workers there, directly help the environment, directly go after some of the trends that are causing climate change. And if you are a progressive, you want higher standards, enforceable standards, in those regions.

It will be debated for two months before I even sign the agreement. Once I sign the agreement, it is going to take several months before Congress votes on the agreement.

I want to ask you about Japan in a second, but you have referred to China a couple of times here. Let me ask you about that. I looked up the numbers. So, Chinese exports to the rest of Asia have more than doubled since 2009. They are setting up a new infrastructure development bank. They are literally paving roads so that they can export their own goods. Is the U.S. losing the economic competition in Asia to China right now? Well, I think the way to think about it is China's a massive country with huge gravitational pull. And they are going to be the dominant economy in Asia for decades to come, just by virtue of sheer size. We want China to continue to embark on its peaceful rise. I think that is good for the world. You know, China lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty is good for us. We just want to make sure that the rules of the road allow us to complete and everybody else to compete. We do not want China to use its size to muscle other countries in the region around rules that disadvantage us. And so what we have said consistently to China is, you know, we want you to succeed.

If you are still mad about Nafta from 25 years ago, because the labor and environmental provisions were in a side letter as opposed to in the agreement and could not be enforced, well guess what? Effectively, we are renegotiating Nafta to solve some of those problems through the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But you talk about - with the risks of withdrawal - when you look at Congress today there is reluctance to renew the Export-Import Bank. There has been a confluence of anti-global engagement from both elements of the right and elements of the left that I think are a big mistake. We sell tons of goods through the Export-Import Bank.

We cannot compete against Germans or Chinese competitors if the Export-Import Bank is not there. You know, it defies imagination that we would not want to support a very robust Export-Import Bank. The IMF - when I came into office we negotiated to makes sure that the United States did not see any of its voting shares diminish in the IMF. We got the Europeans to agree to give up some of their voting shares to accommodate rising powers like China and India.

It is a way for us through peaceful means to expand our influence and our power and to make sure that the international rules of the road are working for us and working for everybody who is following basic international norms. I wanted to ask quickly about Japanese Prime Minister Abe. You are going to talk about trade, I assume - a lot, probably. Are you close to having a bilateral agreement with the Japanese that would be part of the overall Asian trade deal - in fact, would open the way for this whole broader deal to get done. Well, Japan is a huge component of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Prime Minister Abe, to his credit, has been, I think, bold and aggressive in trying to shake up the Japanese economy that is been now in a couple-decade-long slump. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is part of his agenda. Negotiations are tough on both sides because he is got his own politics and interests. Japanese automakers want certain things.

Whether I can convince some who are, you know, more comfortable with the status quo, you know, that is an open question. You know, there was a lot of skepticism about us saving the auto industry. I was confident that if the American auto industry retooled, if management and labor got together and changed the way it did business that it could prosper. I am also confident that over the course of 10 or 15 or 20 years that the American auto industry can continue to thrive. But what we have learned is that the American auto industry does not thrive when it tries to avoid the future. It thrives when it seizes the future. And that is true of our economy generally. We know that even though gas prices are low right now, over the long term fossil fuels are going to be more expensive. Detroit needs to be focused on capturing, you know, the lion's share of the market for fuel-efficient cars. And you know, they worked with us to double fuel-efficiency standards. We like big cars and we like driving long ways and we like cheap gas. And I keep on telling folks, enjoy the fact that gas is cheap right now, but we have got to plan for the future. And just as it is true with the auto industry generally, it is true for American manufacturing. It is true for American services. It is true for American energy production and innovation. When we are bold and we, you know, take a look at where we are going to be 10, 15, 20 years from now, we plan for it, we invest for it, we go after it, we succeed - nobody can beat us. And when we hunker down and we are defensive and scared of the future, that is when we get our clock cleaned. So let me - let me ask you about the broader economy.

Well, it is important to remember that, over the course of five years now, we have had job growth every month. The unemployment rate's come down from 10 to 5.5 , and it continues to improve. It has not been improving as quickly over the last several months as it was, let us say, last year. Now, there are some specific things we could do that would make a difference. If we move forward on a strong infrastructure bill, which traditionally has received bipartisan support - if you talk to Republicans and Democrats, they will both say we know we got to fix our roads, our bridges, our ports, our broadband lines, our smart grid. If we did that, we'd put people back to work right now, it would be a huge boost to the economy, and it would pay off for decades to come. That is what we need to compete. And so there are certain things that we know can make a difference. We should be doing it right now. But weakness in the economy that we see primarily as coming out of Europe, which has been soft for a long time now, and China, which is trying to transition away from solely relying on exports to a more domestic consumption model - that is actually a good thing over the long term, but short term it means that demand globally is a little bit soft. But overall, we are doing better and have been doing better than any other of the advanced economies, and we can continue to do that as long as we make some smart decisions starting now. We talked about a visitor, Prime Minister Abe. What are you going to tell him? What do you expect he is going to want to tell you? Well, I have had the honor of meeting him already once, and extraordinary individual, I think a transformative leader, not just within the Catholic Church but globally.

Well, let me say, first of all, I think the direction of the G-7 meeting is more important than the declaration. I think you put too much, sometimes, stock in the statement. I think it is very important that as world leaders we recommit ourselves to a strategy of global growth, to a strategy of open trade, to seriously examining the problems we are all having with creating jobs, and to dealing with the common security issues that we face. I predict that we will have a very successful meeting as regards Russia. And I still believe that we can make a lot of headway on the issues of trade and global growth. You know, what we really need to do with all the economic problems our nations have and the political problems is to remind ourselves that these are still very great countries with enormous possibilities and a great future.

Well, first of all, let me say that my trip to Tokyo is a trip to the G-7 but also to Japan and to Asia. So one of the things that I intend to do is to make absolutely clear the United States' continuing commitment to engagement in Asia.

But I do have some ideas about those things that I will be discussing with the other leaders. ENTITY, let me start my question with your view on Japan. Since you took office you have mentioned Japan several times. At times you were somewhat stem, expressing its remoteness from an open market. At times you were generous for expressing the relationship of the most important bilateral one for the United States. Which of your assessments is true to your feeling? First of all, I probably have more admiration for your country in more ways than any ENTITY who has ever served. I have had the privilege of traveling to Japan many times. I actively sought Japanese companies to come to my State when I was a Governor. I believe you have a very great country with an even brighter future than your past. I think that our relationship is based on our ability to stand up for our common security interests, to promote the values of democracy and free markets, and to have a reasonable trade relationship. I think that there are things that we need to do in our trade relationship that will benefit both of us. I do not want to create American jobs at the expense of Japanese jobs. I think that changing the nature of the trading relationship is in the interest of both countries, and I do not think it is fair for an ENTITY to ask another country to do something that is good for America but bad for the other country. If I did not think it was good for both of us, I would not push that. But I think we will work that out. And the main thing I want to say to the people of Japan is that this period of political turmoil is not a bad thing for Japan. I know it is different from what you have experienced in the last few decades, but Japan has had an astonishing amount of success with the certain political arrangement. But as the global economy changes, as the people of Japan themselves change in their aspirations, the political system will have to alter to reflect that. And the people of Japan should be, I think, very hopeful about their future.

I am not pessimistic at all about it, I am very hopeful that we will work these things out in ways that are good for both countries. I want to emphasize that. I have seen some of the press reports in Japan of some of my statements as if I want to protect American jobs and take Japanese jobs away. It is far more complex than that. I think that both of us have to undergo changes. Every nation represented in this circle, with the possible exception of Russia, has hounded the United States, has asked the United States for years to do something about our big Government deficit, saying that that caused a big imbalance in global trade. We are doing that. And change is not easy, and I think all of us will have to make some changes. I think we will see-my hunch is that the capacity for adjustment in both countries is greater than we sometimes think, and I think we will resolve this pretty quickly. ENTITY, may I begin by asking you about Bosnia? There is an impression that the indecisive way in which you have handled this issue is an illustration of the widening gap of trust between America and Europe. You advocated lifting the arms embargo on the Muslims and striking at some Serbian positions. And then you appeared to back away from that. Then you moved to a compromise plan for setting up safe havens. Now, that is a concept which you, yourself, described as a shooting gallery. Are you preparing now to wash your hands of this whole affair and possibly to blame the Europeans for the failure? Let me, first of all, point out what the United States has done just since I have been ENTITY. We spent a great deal of money on humanitarian aid; we have pushed hard for strengthening the embargo against Serbia; we have pushed for a number of other things to try to help resolve the situation that we have all agreed on. I did not back away from my position, sir. Britain and France and Russia said they would not support that position within the United Nations.

The leaders of Britain and France and Russia honestly did not believe that lifting the embargo would make things better, would hasten the day of peace. We had an honest disagreement. The German Government agreed with the position I took. But it was an honest disagreement within the most complicated foreign policy problem that any of us have faced in years. I do not seek to place blame anywhere. When my position did not prevail and when I did not have the power to implement it unilaterally because of the U.N. embargo on arms- all I could do is do what we did last week. I voted with many of the nonaligned nations in the United Nations, and we did not win the battle. But then I went back when you talk about changing my position, what I did was I went back to the British, the French, and the others and I said, Okay, what can we agree on? We do not want to say, 'Well, we did not get our way; so we are going to go home.' We will work with you. What can we agree on? They proposed a course that we then embarked on, and they agreed not to totally rule out lifting the arms embargo at a later date. So I, frankly, was pleased to try to work with and to support the efforts of Europe in this regard. I did not point the finger or blame. But we cannot deny the fact that there was an honest disagreement. So may I, as a follow-up, press you on this? You see, as you say, you voted at the United Nations with Djibouti and Morocco and Pakistan and the Cape Verde Islands on this issue about the arms embargo against Britain and France. Now, the impression still, though, is that nothing very much is happening and that it is felt it is very different when the issue, say, is Iraq when the job can be done with unmanned Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from a safe distance.

The United Nations operates against, if you will-the governing resolution of the United Nations is against the policy that I have advocated in Bosnia. Therefore, it would take a change in the United Nations posture to effect that policy. The United States cannot go out and violate international law or go out on its own. That is not-we have never been for that.

Now, when you meet President Yeltsin in a few days in Tokyo, on these lines what would your posture be there? How would you address these issues? And let me remind you that our Prime Minister Chernomyrdin was unable to come here because there were some differences unresolved yet.

We are all having economic trouble, so there will not be probably as much money as I would like because of the economic difficulties that all the nations have.

ENTITY, Prime Minister Balladur has warned there will be no world trade agreement unless U.S. penalties on steel are lifted. What can the United States do in Tokyo to try to diffuse the confrontation? And do you think there is any room for a political compromise? Well, let me say, first of all, the White House had no involvement in that case. We have a process here which is almost like a judicial process in a court for dealing with these things. Clearly, it is legal to have this kind of operation under GATT. So the legality is not in question. If the Prime Minister believes that the facts are different from the facts that were found here, obviously, we can discuss that. My attitude about that is that all these issues ought to be subject to discussion at the C-7 meetings. I mean, one of the things that really bothers me about some of these meetings in the past is that we have all been so afraid of making a mistake, that we have all of our aides around, and we have got everything written down on paper. And if you spend all your time trying to avoid making a mistake, it is hard to make anything good happen. And so one of the things that I am really working for at G-7 is a totally open framework where we can honestly share with each other what we feel and how we can resolve this. France, if I might say, France has 'had some truly astonishing economic accomplishments in the last 10 years, many years in which the productivity growth in France was higher than any other European country and higher than the United States' growth.

We restored order. Children can go to school again. Now, Somalia did not have the infrastructure of a nation. Aideed presented us a problem. We did our best to break the back of his military capacity to disrupt Somalia without appearing to go after him personally. I would like it if he were arrested but without trying to just take him out personally. I think we are on the right path in Somalia, but we have to have patience in nation-building. With regard to Iraq, the action I took in Iraq was specifically designed to respond to the attempt to assassinate President Bush. There are a whole set of other issues which have to do with Iraq's defiance of the U.N. resolutions. The Security Council issued a very stern warning to Iraq, and I think there will either be more compliance or some sort of appropriate action. But again, I would say to you if you look at Iraq and you say we did not solve that, it seems to me that the west did the right thing in not being obsessed with deposing Saddam Hussein. We acted against him because he invaded Kuwait. So he was removed from Kuwait and has been confined in a lot of the mischief he might have otherwise have wreaked. So I do not know if you can tout that as a failure. Bosnia is a disappointment, but it is the most difficult problem, not only in Europe but in the world. We have honest disagreements among ourselves. I still have every hope that something can be done. And I have said repeatedly that the United States would be prepared to contribute to a genuine effort to maintain the peace if an agreement can be signed. I had thought, as you know, that lifting the arms embargo would accelerate movement to a genuine peace. I still believe that. That is the way it is in the world we are living in.

I do not think I should involve myself too much in the internal politics of Germany over this issue except to say that as ENTITY I am profoundly grateful for the position that Chancellor Kohl has taken on these issues and the willingness of the German people to support involvement in Somalia, to try to help insofar as they could in Bosnia. And I think it is very hopeful for the future. I think all of us will have to get into more of these difficult situations like Somalia that have no easy immediate answer if we are going to try to help. If we can reach an agreement in Bosnia and we wind up sending troops there as a result of a peace agreement, there still will be ragged edges to it and difficult moments. ENTITY, I'd like to turn if I could to the issue of the North American Free Trade Agreement. As you know, there was a U.S. court ruling this week that said that NAFTA could do serious damage to the environment and ordering your administration to conduct an environmental impact review. You have decided to appeal that decision. What happens if you lose the appeal? Are you going to at that point bull ahead with NAFTA and ignore the court order? Well, in our country we cannot ignore court orders. But, first of all, we announced that we would appeal within the hour of the decision. We also are exploring other options for compliance that would not delay the treaty, and we are proceeding full-speed ahead. But the irony of this is that, as you know, this administration has taken some extra time with NAFTA to try to conclude environmental agreements that would make it absolutely clear that the NAFTA agreement would improve the environment on both sides of the border. So this is a delaying tactic but does not square with the facts. NAFTA will help us to improve the environment on both sides of the border. That is what we are negotiating so hard with the Mexicans on, and the Canadians have been supportive of the idea that we ought to try to make sure that there is no environmental degradation.

Pete Wilson, Governor of California, has taken a very strong position against your position, that is, your position supporting the law which would prohibit Federal funding of clinics that disseminate abortion information.

What do you see as the most important criteria in making these final decisions? What I see is the most important criteria is what is best for the overall defense of this country. We have seen in the war the need to have a rapid-deployed force that is the best in the world. And we have seen in this, out of the Gulf Desert Storm operation, Desert Shield, the need to project naval forces around the world. So, the policies of the Defense Department are based on this national interest. Now, there is a Base Closure Commission that will be making final recommendations, and they are trying to approach this without regard to politics. They are trying to say what is the best for the national defense. And as you would cite the concerns from a shipyard that has performed well, I can shift you to the east coast and cite the concerns about an airbase that my airplane lands in that was the first one -- Air Force One up at Pease Air Force Base, the SAC base -- that had a useful role to play in Desert Storm and is targeted for the first airbase to be closed. I would also make a political statement that I hope is not misinterpreted by the people of Long Beach. Every Congressman I know wants to close bases, but they want to close them in the other guy's district.

So, are you saying that you are likely to go down the line with the recommendations of the Defense Base Closure Commission regardless of whether those recommendations run counter to your short-term economic goals and dollars?

It would not compel employers to put in quotas in order to avoid lawsuits. I feel strongly about this legislation. I cannot get my legislation seriously considered, hearings before committees on it. It is harder, given the fact the other party controls both Houses of the Congress, to get the things done I want done -- or put it more broadmindedly, get the things done that I think I was elected to do.

Sanction the use of force. Do what every nation in the world has done almost through the United Nations sanctions. There it was different because the President in foreign policy and in running a war, if you will, has much more power in the ability to call decision. I did not have to call the subcommittee on military defense to ask if the air war should start. I did not have to summon the congressional leaders to say, please give me a vote, 6 to 4, as to whether we are going to start the ground war. And so, that part -- not that the war was easy, not that the committing of forces was easy, but from a running-my-job standpoint it was easier. I could assign the duties to Norm Schwarzkopf, through Colin Powell, through Cheney, and not have to worry about a subcommittee wanting to take a look and now we will reallocate -- hey, Norm, do not send the 81st Airborne there; put them over here in Iraq somewhere. It is a big difference; foreign policy is a big difference, not in funding but a big difference in how you run, making something happen. And that is going to mean I need more support in the Congress -- excuse the pitch. In a sense, you are saying that, as for your job, the war with Iraq was easier than the war with Congress?

Before I take your questions, let me just take a moment to recap what I believe is America's agenda in the coming months. Our trip to Europe advanced America's ideals and interests. Working with our partners, we won an agreement to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world, took new steps to strengthen the global economy, agreed to triple the debt relief provided for many of the poorest nations, and to strengthen democracy and reform in Russia. We also worked to put together, to put in place the building blocks of peace in Kosovo and to put the Balkans on a shared path to a prosperous, united future. I will meet with the region's leaders later this summer to give the process further momentum. I met with Kosovar refugees in Macedonia who are planning to return home. They thanked America and our Allies for giving them a chance to reclaim their lives on their native lands. I also met with and thanked some of the American air men and women who achieved the success and with some of our and other NATO troops who are going into Kosovo now to make sure we win the peace. They know that they are doing the right thing, and I am very proud of all of them. While America is enjoying success abroad, it is important that we keep pushing forward on our challenges here at home. This is a time of great hope for our Nation. Just today we learned that the American economy grew at a 4.3 percent in the first 3 months of this year. America plainly is on the right track. But we will be judged by what we do with this opportunity, whether we seize it or squander it in petty bickering and partisan animosity. This summer should be a season of progress. legislation to let disabled Americans keep their Medicaid health insurance when they go to work; an increase in the minimum wage; campaign finance reform; a strong and enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. I was heartened that earlier today the House overwhelmingly passed legislation making sure that foster children are not cast out in the cold when their time in foster care ends.

On Tuesday I will propose the detailed plan to modernize Medicare, cutting costs, improving service, and helping senior citizens with their greatest growing need, affordable prescription drugs. Second, we must widen the circle of opportunity by investing in education while demanding accountability and insisting that the Congress keep our commitment of last year to finish hiring 100,000 more teachers to lower class size in the early grades. Third, in 2 weeks I will be joined by corporate, civic, and political leaders of both parties on a 4-day tour of America's new markets, the places in our country which have not yet felt the surge of our prosperity, to mobilize the private sector to bring jobs and growth to our poorest neighborhoods and to build support for our new markets initiative to give tax credits and loan guarantees to those who invest in America on the same terms we give to those who invest in developing economies overseas. And fourth, in the wake of the tragedy at Littleton, we must continue to meet the challenge of youth violence. Hillary and I are developing a national campaign on youth violence, working with parents, educators, the entertainment industry, and others. But we also must take sensible steps to take guns out of the hands of criminals and away from children. We cannot expect young people to stand up to violence if Congress will not stand up to the gun lobby. I proposed and, with a tie-breaking vote by Vice ENTITY Gore, the Senate passed the measure to close the gun show loophole. The Senate also passed legislation to require child safety locks, to ban large ammunition clips for assault weapons, to ban violent juveniles from owning handguns as adults. Two weeks ago the Republicans in the House blocked that measure. They would even weaken the current law by letting criminals store their guns at pawnshops. Republican leaders could appoint legislators as negotiators to craft a bill that includes the tough Senate provisions. I hope they will do that and send me a strong bill. Plainly, the country wants that. Again I say, this is sort of like the Patients' Bill of Rights; it is really not a partisan issue anywhere but Washington, DC. I hope they will send me a strong bill.

What is caused us not to put it out is that I have not had the time to give to it, to be very careful and relaxed and thoughtful about how I say what it is I want to say to the country about this. ENTITY, this morning and again just now, you made references to a summer of progress, and you were calling for bipartisanship to try to accomplish things in the next few months. I am just wondering, with the 2000 campaign obviously heating up and growing in intensity, do you feel there is more of an urgency to act right away, within the coming months?", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference1065", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1065", "publication_date": "25-06-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 3714, "text": "Well, for one thing, I think it would be to everyone's advantage to continue to make progress. As I always tell the Republicans and Democrats, no matter how much we do, there will still be plenty of things on which there is honest disagreement, over which the next election can be fought. That is just in the nature of things. That is healthy; that is good; that is a two-party system in America. But we are all hired by the American people to work here day-in and day-out, week-in and week-out, and we make a grave mistake and it is almost never good politics to do the wrong thing, that is, to take a pass on making progress when you can do it. This is a very unusual moment where we have sustained prosperity, the longest peacetime expansion in our history. We have gone from having the biggest deficits in history to having the biggest surpluses in history. And yet, we have these looming demographic challenges of Social Security and Medicare. And we have these big issues that are right before us now, the ones I mentioned on which there is basically broad agreement. So I think that it would be good for America and, therefore, good for everyone involved if we go ahead and do this. I think, obviously, the closer you get to the election, perhaps the more difficult it will be. But I expect I will make you a prediction here I expect that we will get some good things done in the year 2000, before the Congress recesses finally for the election then. I expect to keep working right up to the very end, and I think that we will continue to make progress. But the most important thing is the attitude of the main players in Congress, insofar as Congress has to play a role in this. ENTITY, in the wake of California Congressman Christopher Cox's study of spying in the U.S. and, specifically, Chinese attempts to spy, you asked your Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board to look into this, and it came back with a central recommendation that you separate the Nation's nuclear labs from the Energy Department. Your Energy Secretary seems to be resisting that. Do you still maintain that you were not told anything about these Chinese efforts to spy at the Nation's nuclear labs during your administration, sir? Let us go back to the first question there are two separate questions. I read Senator Rudman's report.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference1065", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1065", "publication_date": "25-06-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 3715, "text": "I thought it was quite interesting and had a lot of very helpful analyses of how this problem developed. either that the labs could be put under an independent board, or that the labs should be taken out of the present hierarchy of organization because of the culture the committee the Rud-man group talked a lot about the culture of the labs and its resistance to oversight. He said another alternative might be to take it out from under the present organizational structure and make it directly answerable the labs directly answerable to the Secretary's Office. And he posed those things in the alternative. I have asked our people to look at it. I have talked to Secretary Richardson about it. I think everyone recognizes that he has worked very hard to deal with the underlying security issues, which are the most important things. And I think we all just ought to try to get together and work out what the best organizational structure is, and I expect that we will be I expect to have a chance to talk to him about that and to work on it. But I think the Rudman report was a service to the country, and I think that Bill Richardson is doing a good job on trying to implement the security measures that are necessary. Now, on the second question, I went back I have been interested in this question, and I went back and looked at exactly what I said. And what I said was that I did not suspect that any actual breaches of security had occurred during my tenure. Since then, we have learned of the offloading of the computer by Mr. Lee, from the secured computers into his personal computers. That is something we know now that I did not know then. But I think my choice of wording was poor. What I should have said was I did not know of any specific instance of espionage, because I think that we have been suspicious all along. And I have to acknowledge, I think, I used a poor word there. We did not have any specific instance, as we now do, of the offloading of the computer. But I also want to emphasize that I took no particular comfort in that, because what we have here is what I learned in 1997 was that there was a general problem of very long standing with the security at the labs, and I issued the Executive order in early '98 to clean it up. And Secretary Richardson has been working on it since then. And I think we have made a lot of progress since then.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference1065", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1065", "publication_date": "25-06-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 3716, "text": "Sir, I'd like to ask you about Medicare and your plans that you are going to be announcing next week. This is a program that tens of millions of Americans depend on, and yet in 15 years it will be effectively bankrupt. And you are about to propose what could be a very costly additional benefit in the prescription benefit. Why are you going to do that, sir? For one thing let me remind you that we have taken a lot of very tough positions to reform Medicare since 1993. When I took office, Medicare was supposed to go broke this year. So we have taken a lot of important positions already. And as a matter of fact, as I am sure you are all aware, a lot of the health care providers, particularly rural hospitals, nursing homes, home health providers, a disproportionate share of hospitals for the folks listening to us, that is basically inner-city hospitals and teaching hospitals that have a whole lot of poor folks they take care of who are not reimbursed a lot of those people believe that our savings are too great. But we have taken some very tough actions to try to lengthen the life of the Medicare Trust Fund. When I make my proposals on Tuesday, there will be more to lengthen the life further, to make sure that we get through the first quarter century and maybe more of the new century with Medicare alive and well. But if you look at the long run, I think it is important that we propose a prescription drug benefit because life expectancy is going up. Drugs are being constantly developed which help to improve the quality as well as the length of life, and if they are properly taken, they can actually reduce long-term hospitalization and other medical costs. Now, it is absolutely true that if we design this wrong, it could wind up being a lot more expensive than rosy scenario suggests. But if you look at my record here over the last 6 1/2 years, I have tried to be quite conservative in my budget projections and quite responsible in handling the budget of the country. And you will see that, I think, reflected in the way I make this proposal, including the prescription drugs. You have got 15 million Americans, seniors, out there without any kind of coverage for their medicine. You have got millions and millions of others with inadequate or highly expensive coverage. And I just I really believe that this is the most significant health care need that senior citizens have today.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference1065", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1065", "publication_date": "25-06-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 3717, "text": "And I believe that over the long run, the proper availability, properly priced, of prescription medicine will actually not only lengthen lives and improve the quality of life of our seniors and improve their security, their state of mind, but it will also, long, long-term, save medical costs because it will keep people out of hospitals and out of more expensive treatments. What is your strategy now, ENTITY, for a comprehensive campaign finance reform, to really make it pass? Well, I think the best strategy is to get a clear majority of the House of Representatives to demand that it come up and then try to put enough pressure on to get the Senate leaders to let it come up. Basically, the Republican leadership in the Senate has said that they are just not going to permit it to come up, because they do not want their people who would vote against it to have a recorded vote on it and they do not want to run the risk that they have got enough for their folks that would vote with all of ours. See, all of our people are for it. We have got 100 percent of the Democrats in the Senate for it. And so, what I think we have to do is to keep it on the front burner enough so that the discomfort level rises high enough that an actual vote is allowed. If we'd just get a vote on the bill, I will be very well satisfied, and I think it will come out just fine. Can I ask a political question? When Vice President Gore announced officially for President, he chose a date when you were going to be out of the country. And according to Mrs. Clinton's supporters, if she announces her exploratory committee in the next couple of weeks, it would be at a time when you have got a commitment to go out to South Dakota. Do you think your personal behavior has made you something of a liability to those who are running? And did you take it personally when Vice President Gore made his announcement and seemed to set himself so clearly separate from you when it came to issues of family? Well, first of all, I thought, as I have said repeatedly, I thought the Vice President had a great announcement. And what he really said in his announcement I actually heard it, so I do not have to have it characterized for me.", "label": "dialogic", "metadata": {"text_id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference1065", "title": "The President's News Conference", "source": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1065", "publication_date": "25-06-1999", "crawling_date": "10-09-2023", "politician": ["William J.

{"id": 3718, "text": "What he said in his announcement was that he had had more experience than anybody running, which is true; that he would put forward more specific ideas about what he would do if he were elected President than anyone has to date, by far, which is true; and that the choice before the American people was whether we would build on the progress that we have made for the last 6 years or turn around and go backwards, which is what I think the real choice will be before the American people. So I approved of that. And as far as his doing it when I was out of the country, I thought that was a good thing. Very often, you'd be amazed how many times over the last 6 1/2 years we have planned for certain announcements to be made by the Vice President when I was out of the country, because that way it gets I mean, far be it for us to try to maneuver the press but he gets better coverage, and I get better coverage I am out of the country, so he gets better coverage. And I think on the general point, what I have noticed over now more than 30 years, since I first began to volunteer as a young man in politics, all politics, all elections are about the future, and all candidates are judged on their own merits. But I think that the American people know that the country's in good shape and that not only our economic policies, our crime policies, and our welfare policies, but our family policies are good for their efforts to raise their children. And the best thing that I can do, it seems to me, is to do the right thing by my country, to just keep working at being a good ENTITY, and they will do fine. Not be with Mrs. Clinton when she campaigns? Well, first of all, she has not made a decision to announce to run for the Senate. And as a practical matter, logistically and legally as a practical matter, she has to have an exploratory committee to continue to talk to people in New York about this. She has not made a final decision to run yet.

Well, I do not think they could do it without a lot of help in the short run. And I think I was asked this question earlier in a slightly different question I think that the first and most important thing is for us to get the whole KFOR force in there, all 50,000, as quickly as possible, properly deployed to maximize security. Then I think we have got to get people busy doing positive things, rebuilding their homes, reestablishing their property records, reestablishing their schools. We have got to give them something to think about on a daily basis that is positive. Then I strongly believe we need to give them the help they need to try to work through this emotionally, psychologically, spiritually, morally. I think a lot of these children are going to need mental health services, and I hope we can get them. I think that we need to bring people in who have been through similar things. I had a long talk with Elie Wiesel about this after he came back. He went over and toured the camps for me and talked to the people. I think that there are people who've been through the Holocaust who can help a lot. I think there are people who have been through South Africa and the peace and reconciliation commission and 300 years of what those people went through there who can help a lot. I think we need to be quite imaginative about once we get the building blocks of security and the building blocks of reconstruction in place and the building blocks of civil society in place, then I think we need to be quite imaginative about the human, spiritual dimension of this. And I will do my best to be supportive. I have talked to Reverend Jackson about this, about the importance of bringing in religious leaders from all the not only from the Muslim and the Orthodox faiths to come and work together and work people through this but perhaps others as well.

{"id": 3720, "text": "ENTITY the future of this country, it seems to me that one of our big issues is parenting that causes divorces having children and breaking up the families. Is not there any way that we can design a national program to educate people ? On the to go to your point when Hillary and I decided that we ought to have this grassroots campaign to try to protect children against violence and we began to talk to Pam Eakes, who started the Mothers Against Violence movement in Washington State, and others, one of the things that we learned, obviously, is that a lot of young people wind up being especially really troubled young people can often be almost strangers in their own homes. And we assume that people ought to just know how to do the most important jobs in life, and they are very often reluctant to ask for help. But I think one of the things that we have to try to do is to develop the kind of supports parents need to do a better job. And it is a much harder job now than it used to be, especially since the average parent is away from his or her children for 22 hours a week more than was the case 30 years ago. So I do think that we need to do some more. Most parents, however, want to do a good job, really, really want to do a good job. And I think when you start with that, one of the things that I hope very much will come out of this whole movement against teen violence is more efforts in that regard. Of course, that is one of the reasons that Hillary wrote her book a few years ago she knows more about that than I do and, of course, one of the reasons the Vice President and Mrs. Gore had those family conferences every year, starting before he joined the ticket with me back in '92. The short answer to your question is, yes, we should do more to help parents do a good job. ENTITY, a lot of Medicare beneficiaries are enthusiastic about the idea of a new prescription drug benefit but perhaps less enthusiastic about paying higher premiums to pay for it. Should Medicare beneficiaries, themselves, be prepared to endure some pain to get some gain? Should they be prepared to pay higher premiums? And especially, should higher income Medicare beneficiaries pay means-tested premiums that are higher?
