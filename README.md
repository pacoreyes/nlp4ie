## Abstract

This thesis presents the development of an information extraction (IE) system designed to identify and extract political statements at the passage level, a task that is located amid computational linguistics and discourse analysis.

The core of this research is the creation and refinement of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that serve distinct functions within the IE pipeline. These models have been meticulously crafted, employing both

- rule-based models, which leverage linguistic structures and features at the morphologic, syntactic, semantics, and pragmatics levels, and

- deep-learning models harness the performance of neural networks.

The rule-based models offer the advantage of explainability, a crucial aspect when dealing with the nuanced domain of political text, allowing for the extraction process to be transparent and interpretable through linguistic rules. On the other hand, deep-learning models contribute robustness and adaptability, learning from data to capture complex patterns that may elude rule-based approaches.

## Paper 1: Performance and Explainability of Rule-based, Machine Learning, and BERT Models in Monologic and Dialogic Classification

### Abstract

This study introduces an approach to this classification task, exploring the performance and explainability of rule-based and deep-learning models, focusing on the BERT model. We leverage this taxonomy for classifying political discourse, providing linguistic interpretations of defining features and model behaviors. The research aims to balance accuracy and explainability in NLP models while investigating the critical linguistic features vital for classification and their behavior across different models and exploring the possibility of developing a hybrid model that amalgamates their strengths.
